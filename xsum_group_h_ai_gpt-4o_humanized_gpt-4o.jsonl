It is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that: Originally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May. The standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January. What's it for? The government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous. The tax will also raise a lot of money for the government. So will this help deal with the budget deficit? The Treasury hopes the tax will bring in \u00a32.6bn every year. That's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year. It's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five. What's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage? Traditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies. But during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets. Unlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again. A lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days. When the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts. This caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend. Unable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure. Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy? Bank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock. But since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs.", "text_ai_base": "What is the levy, what is at stake, and why is the rate being increased now? The bank levy is an annual tax on the debt value of UK banks, including deposited funds, with exceptions. Initially, the Treasury planned a lower rate of 0.05% for 2011, but in February, it opted for a standard rate of 0.075% starting in May. The rate was slightly raised to 0.078% in March and will increase again to 0.088% from January. The purpose of the levy is twofold: the government aims to deter banks from depending on risky borrowing methods, which contributed to worsening the 2008 crisis, and to generate substantial revenue. Can it help address the budget deficit? The Treasury estimates the levy will generate \u00a32.6 billion annually, which amounts to 2.1% of the forecast budget deficit by the Office for Budget Responsibility this year. It represents roughly 19% of the pre-tax profits reported by the five major UK banks in the 12 months leading to September, though the tax applies to more banks than just these five. What about the borrowing the government wishes to discourage? Traditionally, banks lend out money from the deposits made by individuals and businesses. However, over the last decade, banks have adopted new, complex methods to borrow trillions from global markets. Unlike regular deposits, there is no natural cap on this money since it can originate globally and circulate repeatedly among banks. A substantial portion of these debts was short-term, requiring banks to return to the markets for refinancing every few days. During the financial crisis, investors feared banks might default on their debts, triggering a market panic where investors stopped lending. This inability to refinance threatened even profitable banks with collapse. Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy? Bank runs typically conjure images of long queues of depositors withdrawing funds\u2014as seen with Northern Rock. Since the 1930s, governments have insured most citizens' deposits to prevent such depositor bank runs.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "What's this bank levy all about, what's the big deal, and why are they hiking it now? Basically, it's a yearly tax on the debt of UK banks, which covers things like deposited funds, but there are some exceptions. Originally, the plan was to set the levy rate at 0.05% in 2011. However, in February, the Treasury decided to bump it up to a standard rate of 0.075% starting in May. They then nudged it to 0.078% in March and are planning another increase to 0.088% from January. So, what's the deal with this levy? It's got a two-part purpose: one, to discourage banks from relying on risky borrowing practices\u2014which was a huge factor in the 2008 crisis\u2014and two, to rake in a hefty amount of cash. Can it help chip away at the budget deficit? Well, the Treasury figures this levy will pull in about \u00a32.6 billion a year. That's about 2.1% of the budget deficit forecasted by the Office for Budget Responsibility for this year. And it's roughly 19% of the pre-tax profits made by the five big UK banks over the 12 months up to September, though, more banks are taxed under this levy than just those five. Now, about the borrowing they're looking to curb: Banks traditionally lend out money from deposits made by people and businesses. But in the past decade, they've been getting creative, hitting up global markets to borrow trillions through new, tricky methods. Unlike regular deposits, this kind of money doesn't have a natural limit because it can come from all over and get recycled among banks. A lot of this borrowing was on a short leash, meaning banks had to go back to the market for refinancing super frequently. When the financial crisis hit, investors got jittery about possible bank defaults, and this led to a panic where they just stopped lending. Even profitable banks faced collapse because they couldn't refinance. Why let retail deposits off the hook with this levy? The image of a bank run, with folks queuing down the street to pull their money out\u2014think Northern Rock\u2014is daunting. Since the 1930s, governments have been insuring most people's deposits to stop these kinds of runs among depositors.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

Lethal yellowing, the same condition that devastated the iconic trees in Florida and Jamaica, also strikes at the heart of this 280sq km (108sq mile) island's culture and economy. Here, coconut products are used in everything from food and drink to beauty treatments and traditional medicine. Around 45% of Antigua's thousands of coconut palms have been lost to date, estimates Barbara Japal, president of the island's Horticultural Society. Street vendor Julian Rose is one of those affected. He has been selling coconut water for $3.70 (\u00c2\u00a32.40) a bottle for four years, but says the last 12 months have seen supplies nosedive by half - as has his income. \"I've kept my prices the same - people won't pay more,\" he says. The official advice states that palms showing signs of the contagious disease, characterised by premature shedding of fruit and yellowing fronds that eventually drop off, should immediately be cut down and burned to prevent the disease spreading. But the cash-strapped government's lack of resources has enabled it to run rampant, with the trees dying in droves since lethal yellowing was first identified in 2012. \"It affects tourism because, as we say, the 'palm is the charm' and it really diminishes what the seascape looks like,\" Mrs Japal tells the BBC. \"It's devastating to see them standing there looking like beheaded soldiers.

{"id": "xsum_37512637", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "Well perhaps it is. It certainly took the commodities markets (and me) rather by surprise when it agreed to cut production at a meeting in Algiers. In fact the group has a lot of work to do before it has a real and sustained impact on the price. But that decision was not what the market expected. Traders thought the result would be more disarray, as there was at a meeting of Opec and some other oil exporters in Doha back in April. This time they did manage to make progress. The context for the Algiers decision - and the unsuccessful attempts to agree action before - is crude oil prices are less than half what they were in June 2014. That hurts Opec member countries. Government finances and economic performance have taken a substantial hit. In Saudi Arabia for example, the government's finances were in surplus to the tune of 12% of annual income (GDP) in 2012. Last year there was a deficit of 16%. Angola's economy grew 7% in 2013. Last year it was 3%. Venezuela's figures are much worse, though it's far from being entirely due to the lower price of oil. That has however severely aggravated the economic damage done by the country's political crisis. Opec member countries have felt this financial pain with increasing intensity for almost two years now. Opec doesn't account for the whole market by a long way. There are very large oil producers that are not members, notably the United States, Russia, China and Canada. But the group, which currently has about 40% of the global market can move it by cutting production - and it does have a history of responding to low oil prices, by cutting production. In the past Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest player, has often led the effort. This time the situation was complicated by Iran's emergence earlier this year from international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Tehran was determined to take advantage and sought to recover its share of the market. For Opec, the trouble was that Saudi Arabia was unwilling to curb production without Iran doing likewise, a position also underpinned by the longstanding geopolitical tension between the two countries which are the leading powers in the Gulf. That tension was the reason for the failure in Doha in April. Things seem to have changed. Iran has boosted oil production already. It could go higher, but not as easily as was the case in the immediate aftermath of the lifting of sanctions. Saudi Arabia has softened its position.", "text_ai_base": "Perhaps it was indeed unexpected. The commodities markets\u2014and I myself\u2014were taken by surprise when OPEC decided to cut production at their meeting in Algiers. The group still faces challenges in achieving a meaningful and lasting impact on prices. However, the decision was not anticipated by the market. Traders had expected more disarray, similar to the meeting in Doha last April, involving OPEC and other oil exporters. This time, though, progress was made. The backdrop to Algiers\u2014and previous unsuccessful agreement attempts\u2014is the substantial drop in crude oil prices, now less than half what they were in June 2014. This decline has heavily impacted OPEC countries' finances and economic performance. For instance, Saudi Arabia's government had a surplus amounting to 12% of GDP in 2012, compared to a 16% deficit last year. Angola's economy grew by 7% in 2013, but last year it was only 3%. Venezuela's situation is even worse, though the country's issues extend beyond oil prices, compounded by a political crisis. For nearly two years, OPEC countries have experienced increasing financial strain.

It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England. \"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest\". \"It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps.

He had lost an army.\" The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation.

An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others. \"Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged.

Wood, who served with the 1st Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment, mentioned on BBC Breakfast that the Ministry of Defence acknowledged the government had \"important lessons to learn.\" Referring to the Al-Sweady Inquiry, he condemned severe allegations of unlawful killing, mutilation, and mistreatment of prisoners of war as unfounded. \"Those events simply did not occur, and I don\u2019t understand where these claims originated,\" he remarked, adding that IHAT\u2019s closure was \"good news.\" He noted systemic vulnerabilities that had been exploited and suggested that a more thorough examination of allegations before public release would have been preferable. He shared the personal toll on his team, citing career impacts, marital breakdowns, and exacerbated PTSD from their experiences on the battlefield. Former Army Captain Rachel Webster, arrested during a January 2014 raid, criticized the IHAT closure as \"too little, too late.\" She told ITV News, \"I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. The humiliation was unforgettable, for myself and for other soldiers and veterans who went through this. It has destroyed lives, including mine.\" Mr. Lancaster, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, emphasized the government's responsibility to investigate abuse claims, stating, \"We cannot simply ignore them.\" He indicated that, without IHAT, UK troops might have faced inquiries from the International Criminal Court, but applauded the closure decision as \"positive.\" Established in 2010 to investigate allegations made by Iraqi civilians against UK service members, IHAT was described by the Commons defence committee as an \"unstoppable, self-perpetuating machine, unconcerned with military perspectives.\" On Friday, the Ministry of Defence announced that IHAT would shut down in the summer, with any remaining cases being transferred to the Royal Navy Police.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Sgt.

He did, however, praise the closure as a \"positive\" move. IHAT, which began in 2010 to look into allegations from Iraqi civilians against UK service members, had been criticized by the Commons defence committee for being an \"unstoppable, self-perpetuating machine\" that didn't really consider the military's perspective.

There are rats, the drinking water is dirty, and while it is now stifling under the September Sun, in winter the snow is 3ft (1m) high and they freeze. More importantly, life is getting worse and the pressure to leave Lebanon is growing all the time. One man, Mzead al-Ali, tells me he is on the brink of following those who have made the perilous exodus, leaving his wife and four children, including two seven-month-old twins, behind in the camp, so he can send them money. His brother left three days ago for Turkey. They haven't heard from him since he went, and don't know if he is safe. His mother wants to talk about it but has to keep pressing her hands flat against her face, to stop the tears.

In 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality. An 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status\". Thousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities. As the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division. Weekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair. The church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches.

This model has been used before where central government believed there was a need for radical intervention - such as in Hackney in London.

{"id": "xsum_38451161", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "The problems emerge because the six-digit codes booking systems use to identify travellers are easy to guess. Two researchers demonstrated the weaknesses by changing a flight booking and seat assignment for a reporter. The security investigators presented their findings at the Chaos Communications Congress in Germany. In a blog detailing their work Karsten Nohl and Nemanja Nikodijevic of Security Research Labs (SRL) said the computer systems behind the airlines' travel bookings system dated from the 1970s and 1980s. Though these have been updated with web services they lack security systems that would prevent abuse, they said. In particular, they added, the systems have no way to check, or authenticate, who is querying the system for flight details. Few of the reservation checking systems limit how many attempts can be made to query details. These flaws can be exploited, said the pair, because the codes used to identify travellers and their itineraries use a restricted character set. This makes it possible to bombard servers with queries to find out a person's details. \"Given only passengers' last names, their bookings codes can be found over the internet with little effort,\" they wrote. This access would let attackers steal personal information, divert frequent flyer benefits or use the data to lend credibility to phishing attacks. In some cases, said Mr Nohl, getting at a booking would let an attacker completely change flight details potentially letting them travel for free. SRL showed how the flaws could be exploited by working with German TV station ARD to change the flight of a reporter and putting him in a seat next to a German politician. Airlines and travel agents should move quickly to protect traveller data, urged the two researchers. The first step should be to limit the number of queries that can be made for a particular booking, they said. The vast majority of flight bookings are handled by three firms: Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport. Booking firm Amadeus said it was \"assessing\" the researchers' findings.

Since tuition fees rose to \u00a39,000 in England there have been repeated forecasts that students would head for cheaper European universities. Now it seems to be actually happening. Across the Netherlands, there are 2,600 UK students in universities this term - up by a third in a year. And independent school head teachers want Dutch universities to be included in the Ucas application form. The University of Groningen is a microcosm of this - up by 33% to around 300 UK students, for whom it has had to put on special open days. This 400 year-old university, second oldest in the Netherlands and in the top 100 of international rankings, now designates itself as an English-speaking institution. It is running more degree courses taught in English than in Dutch, with students from Germany, China, the UK and the Netherlands itself, all learning in English. For families from England attending the open day in Groningen, the question of tuition fees is never far from the surface. Phoebe Watkinson and her father Phil had travelled from Wirral.

She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. \"Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,\" he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: \"One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?\" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some \"age-memory\" might be transferred into the next generation. \"That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,\" says Prof Sinclair. \"A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.\" The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half.

It is a collaboration with the National Galleries in London and Dublin. Edinburgh is the last stop for the works inspired by the man known as the \"bad boy\" of early 17th Century art. This is the first exhibition of works by Caravaggio and his followers ever to be shown in Scotland. Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was just 39 when he died in 1610.

It was bought by Scottish country gentleman William Hamilton Nisbet in Rome in 1802, directly from the Mattei family who had commissioned it 200 years earlier. The painting was on display at Biel House in East Lothian for 120 years. Mr Weston-Lewis said: \"His descendants bequeathed a large group of pictures from that collection to the Scottish National Gallery. \"We didn't have space for them all. \"They were paraded in front of the trustees at the next board meeting and some were selected and some weren't. \"Very sadly from our point of view this painting got away.", "text_ai_base": "The Beyond Caravaggio exhibition showcases works by the Italian artist and 30 other European artists influenced by him.

The system utilises one of the University's Digitally Enhanced Learning Spaces (DELS), where students can engage in interactive learning with the aid of 55-inch display screens and state-of-the-art web conference tools. It was developed by Dr John McKeown, a senior clinical lecturer and GP at Cults Medical Group in Aberdeen. He said: \"The biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultations that are almost live, and this adds a sense of immediacy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digitisation has made learning far more interactive. \"We aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the GP's approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate, the direction that they take the consultation, and of course their recommended course of action.\" Dr McKeown said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturers would be able to discuss consultations that have taken place at a variety of practices, where the issues could be very different. He added: \"This means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing GPs who might operate in less affluent areas, or in remote rural locations. \"The system also allows us to work through a number of different consultations in succession, which very much mimics a typical morning for a GP. \"This allows us to see the range of skills - interpersonal, diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day.\" Dr McKeown said that by the time current first year students graduated there would be a pressing need for new GPs in Scotland.", "text_ai_base": "In the past, trainee doctors had to wait up to four years to experience real consultations.

Getting the same improvement in people would be a shift from being unable to hear traffic to hearing a conversation. However, treating humans is still a distant prospect. If you want to listen to the radio or have a chat with a friend your ear has to convert sound waves in the air into electrical signals which the brain will understand. This happens deep inside the inner ear where vibrations move tiny hairs and this movement creates an electrical signal. However, in about one in 10 people with profound hearing loss, nerve cells which should pick up the signal are damaged. It is like dropping the baton after the first leg of a relay race. The aim of researchers at the University of Sheffield was to replace those baton-dropping nerve cells, called spiral ganglion neurons, with new ones. While there is excitement at the prospect of using stem cells to restore nerves in the ear this exact technique will not help the vast, vast majority of people with hearing loss. Most hearing problems are caused by damage to the tiny delicate hairs which convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. This research group have also converted embryonic stem cells into the early versions of the hair cells. However, injecting them into the ear to restore hearing will be no easy task. The hairs cells all need to be in the exact place and pointing in exactly the right direction. Prof Dave Moore said using stem cells to repair the hairs was \"almost an impossible task\" and that the far-fetched concept of growing and transplanting a replacement ear seemed more likely. They used stem cells from a human embryo, which are capable of becoming any other type of cell in the human body from nerve to skin, muscle to kidney. A chemical soup was added to the stem cells that converted them into cells similar to the spiral ganglion neurons. These were then delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils. Over 10 weeks the gerbils' hearing improved. On average 45% of their hearing range was restored by the end of the study. Dr Marcelo Rivolta said: \"It would mean going from being so deaf that you wouldn't be able to hear a lorry or truck in the street to the point where you would be able to hear a conversation.", "text_ai_base": "A UK study, published in the journal Nature, reports that hearing partially improved in gerbils when the nerves responsible for transmitting sound to the brain were rebuilt.

Yet, this kind of treatment is still quite a ways off. For activities like tuning into the radio or chatting with a friend, our ears need to turn sound waves into electrical signals that our brains can interpret.

On Thursday, Ruth Guerra, who led Hispanic media relations for the Republican National Committee, stepped down from her role. Mrs. Clinton has the potential to draw in moderate Republicans disappointed by their party's hardline positions on social issues like gay marriage, abortion, and gun rights, yet who find her foreign policy firm and reassuring. After winning the Pennsylvania primary back in late April, Mrs. Clinton encouraged all \"thoughtful\" Republicans, independents, and Democrats to unite against the divisive Republican candidates. Even though House Speaker Paul Ryan finally threw his support behind Trump on Thursday after weeks of hesitation, many top Republicans remain cautious. Several Republican governors and senators intend to skip the party's convention in July, and some lifelong Republicans are publicly saying they'll cast their votes for a Democrat for the first time this November. While Mrs. Clinton's focus on America's role in global leadership might not sit well with the increasingly isolationist GOP base, it's definitely appealing to a lot of moderates and foreign policy buffs. For a bit there on Twitter, #RepublicansforHillary was trending after Doug Elmets, who served in the Reagan administration, commented on US cable TV that \"four years of Hillary Clinton is better than one day with Donald Trump as president.\"", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

The UK government has previously said it wanted to establish a spaceport by the end of 2018. It launched a consultation in 2014 and two years ago it drew up a shortlist of potential sites. These also included Prestwick in South Ayrshire, Stornoway in the Western Isles, Newquay airport in Cornwall and Llanbedr airport in the Snowdonia National Park.

This meant that Prestwick and Campbeltown are both vying to attract investment to prove they are \"best-placed\" to become the UK's first operational spaceport.

The first increase is now expected in late 2016. Forecasts were put back after the Bank of England's last inflation report in which the Bank said the outlook for global growth had weakened. In a speech to trade union body the TUC, Mr Haldane also indicated that the next rate move could equally be a cut rather than a rise. \"Now more than ever in the UK, policy needs to be poised to move off either foot depending on which way the data break,\" he said in his speech. Mr Haldane said that because wage growth could be weaker than currently expected, inflation may undershoot the Bank's November predictions, when it estimated that inflation would rise above its 2% target in two years. The Consumer Price Index currently stands at 0.1%. \"Against that backdrop, my view is that the case for raising interest rates is still some way from being made,\" Mr Haldane said. \"Whatever the reason, the economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway.

And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world, and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism, scientists say. But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory. Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows, at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now. They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy, doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain, who is leading the research, says: \"There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth. \"It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born, because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain, and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong.\" The study - known as the Developing Human Connectome Project - hopes to look at more than 1,500 babies, studying many aspects of their neurological development. By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and at full term, the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth. And they plan to share their map with the wider research community. Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques, which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now. While in the womb, foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs, and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains. But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements, building up full three-dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion.", "text_ai_base": "By the time a baby takes its first breath, many crucial neural pathways have already been established.

Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College, and Oxford University are working to develop a detailed dynamic wiring map of brain growth that has been previously unattainable. By tracking nerve bundles during the last three months of pregnancy, they hope to gain insights that can help address developmental issues when the process goes awry. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain and lead researcher, highlights the importance of prenatal scans: \"There is a troubling number of children with developmental issues due to factors occurring around birth or shortly beforehand. Scanning babies before birth is vital to capture changes in the brain, a period when many potential problems seem to manifest.\" The Developing Human Connectome Project aims to study over 1,500 babies to explore various facets of their neurological development. The study will examine brains of babies still in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and full-term, to establish benchmarks for normal development and assess influences from birth-related complications. Their findings will be shared with the broader research community. Central to the project are advanced MRI techniques, which can now capture details of the developing brain previously inaccessible.

This endeavor could give us invaluable insights into developmental issues that crop up when things don't go according to plan. Prof. David Edwards, who heads the Centre for the Developing Brain, emphasizes the critical nature of prenatal scans: \"Too many kids face developmental challenges from issues around birth or just before. Scanning the brain while it's still developing is crucial since many problems seem to start appearing then.\" The Developing Human Connectome Project is geared up to look at more than 1,500 babies, diving into their neurological development.

Separately, figures from mortgage lenders show that the government's recently launched Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme seems to have reduced the size of the average deposit required of first-time buyers. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that in January, the average first-time deposit had fallen to 18%, from 20% in December. However, the number of loans to first-time buyers, and to those moving from a home they already own, fell back because of the normal seasonal lull in the market at this time of year.

Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus. It can take Europe\u2019s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today\u2019s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost. That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.

The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year. Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace. The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.

Last year, they won the election so it's all systems go. A referendum is a vote in which all adults can take part, normally giving a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of the votes wins. The European Union, or EU, is a group of 28 countries in Europe whose governments work together. It began after World War Two with the idea that the best chance of stopping another war was by countries working more closely together. It's a bit like a club. To join you have to agree to follow the rules and in return you get certain benefits. Each country has to pay money to be a member, which they mostly do through taxes. The EU uses the money to change the way people live and do business in Europe. It has its own parliament, which is made up of politicians called Members of the European Parliament. They are elected by people who live in European Union countries. One of the main jobs of the parliament is to change, approve or reject laws that apply to all EU countries. 1957: Belgium, France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg 1973: Denmark, Ireland and the UK 1981: Greece 1986: Portugal and Spain 1995: Austria, Finland and Sweden 2004: Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Cyprus 2007: Bulgaria and Romania 2013: Croatia One major reason the European Union was set up is trade: to make it easier for countries to buy and sell things to each other. Certain rules to do with immigration have been relaxed too - so people from EU countries can move around more freely inside the Union. EU laws affect many areas of our lives - like how many hours we're allowed to work in a week, health and safety rules, and even how many fish we're allowed to catch. For the 40 years that the UK's been a member of the EU, there's been a debate about our role within it. Some feel being part of this bigger club makes the UK richer and more important.

Back in 2013, then British Prime Minister, David Cameron, promised that if the Conservative Party won the next general election, he'd let the people decide if the UK should stick around in the EU or not. Fast forward to now: the Conservatives won, so here comes the promised referendum. A referendum\u2019s a straightforward vote where all adults get a say, usually answering a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" question. The side with more than half the votes takes the win. To give a bit of context, the European Union (EU) is essentially a coalition of 28 countries in Europe where governments work together. It was born after World War Two, with an eye towards preventing further conflicts through closer cooperation. Think of it like joining a club: you gotta play by the rules, but you also get perks. Member countries contribute funds, mostly through taxes, that the EU uses to influence how folks live and do business across Europe. There\u2019s an EU parliament too, made up of Members of the European Parliament, who are selected by the citizens of EU countries. The parliament\u2019s job? Tweaking, approving, or throwing out laws that affect all member nations. Here\u2019s who joined when: in 1957, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Luxembourg were the first in; the UK tagged along in 1973 with Denmark and Ireland; Greece hopped on board in 1981, followed by Portugal and Spain in 1986. Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined in 1995; 2004 saw a big wave with Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Cyprus; then there was Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, and finally, Croatia in 2013. The EU was largely set up to make trade smoother, cutting through the red tape when buying and selling between countries. It\u2019s also loosened immigration rules, letting folks move more freely within its borders. EU laws touch on a boatload of things, like work hours, safety standards, and even fishing quotas. Throughout the UK's 40-ish years in the EU, there\u2019s been this ongoing debate about the whole arrangement. Some folks say the EU boosts the UK\u2019s wealth and standing, while others worry it chips away at British sovereignty.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

Chief executive Mike Coupe said he was confident its strategy would enable it to \"outperform our major peers\". German discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which have expanded rapidly in the UK, have been undercutting Sainsbury's and its rivals, including Tesco, Morrisons and Asda. The supermarket chain has fought back by cutting prices on its everyday products rather than run promotions. This quarter, it said it had cut the prices of broccoli, onions, Margherita pizza and its own-brand nappies. Mr Coupe said this strategy was working with customers \"consistently choosing\" Sainsbury's over its rivals. He also said its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos-owner Home Retail Group, which was completed at the beginning of this month, would speed up its plans to allow shoppers to get their goods in different ways.

It has allowed Dr Claire Corkhill and colleagues to probe the changing properties of different mixes of cement over the past 18 months. \"We've been able to gather some very high-resolution data, and this has allowed us to make some predictive models so that we can understand what phases are forming, and when, out to 2,000 years, which is exactly when we expect water to start interacting with a geological disposal facility,\" said the scientist from Sheffield's NucleUS research group.

The team's investigations show No7 to be a much better performer than the currently proposed cement barrier, called Nirex Reference Vault Backfill. But this is not the end of the story - further mixes are being investigated to find even more effective solutions. The cement work has been discussed here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) - as has the long-duration experiment facility at Diamond.

Winning this single match won't insure greatness in 2016, just as losing it won't make us a subpar team.\" Monday's fixture initiates England's qualifying campaign for the tournament in France, featuring 24 teams in the European Championships for the first time. After facing Switzerland, Hodgson's team will engage in nine more matches in Group E over the next 13 months, aiming to secure a spot at the finals. Automatic qualification is granted to the top two teams in each group, along with the best third-placed side. The remaining third-place teams will compete in play-offs. England's previous competitive encounter ended in a goalless draw against Costa Rica in Brazil last June, eliminating them from the group stage after losses to Italy and Uruguay. Hodgson, appointed in 2012 and having led England to the Euro quarter-finals that year, acknowledges the lingering disappointment from the World Cup. Still, he asserts that this challenging fixture in the Euro 2016 qualifiers isn't an entirely fresh start, as he prepares for the upcoming European Championship finals. \"We\u2019re not in the early stages of development,\" he noted. \"We're progressing, despite the World Cup setback. This isn't a completely new squad. Players like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ross Barkley, and Raheem Sterling have been with us before. However, it's still early days, and we must ensure that we're much stronger in the next two years.\" The game against Switzerland follows England's narrow 1-0 friendly victory over Norway at Wembley, where Hodgson showed frustration when confronted with the statistic that his team managed only two shots on target, including Wayne Rooney's penalty goal. Asked about facing criticism post-World Cup, Hodgson replied, \"There's no nasty side to this. I love this job. It's a magnificent opportunity.

The PIDG said it had revised its travel policy, which had seen board members claiming for more expensive flexible business class tickets. But Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the Department for International Development (DfID) was to blame for not keeping a tight enough rein on spending. \"It's outrageous that 15 flights were booked from 2011, each costing over \u00a35,000,\" said Mrs Hodge. \"Only this month has PIDG revised its travel policy.

But it won't be surprising to see it all over the newspapers and stuck in people's memories. And it was a reminder that before Mr Corbyn even tries to win the battles he will certainly face this week - over nuclear weapons, over how to balance the country's books, or over the way Labour makes its decisions - his team's priority must be, get through the week without mishap. For party conferences are strange, intense, microclimates where the what is said on the stage, however carefully crafted or considered, can be subsumed by our old friends, \"events\", however silly. And sometimes those are the moments that shift opinion, or express a truth political parties don't want to contemplate. And occasionally, they are the moments senior politicians lose control. In 2003 I remember seeing Conservative aides grimace during the then leader Iain Duncan Smith's speech, as he promised the \"quiet man\" was \"turning up the volume\". That week, everywhere Conservatives had been huddled in corners wondering how to unseat him. His strangely delivered speech contributed to his ultimate exit. In 2006 I remember Cherie Blair's unguarded, and then denied remark, whizzed round the conference centre in 2006, when she cried out \"it's a lie\" when Gordon Brown heaped praise on her husband. Nothing expressed the levels of bitterness between the two camps so well. In 2008, it wasn't just the rather silly picture of him clutching a banana that put David Miliband onto the front pages, but that he'd been overheard talking of avoiding a \"Heseltine moment\". His leadership ambitions were what made the conference banana moment worth printing. The year before, when Sir Menzies Campbell was already under attack for lacklustre leadership of the Liberal Democrats, I recall the uncomfortable press visit to an environmentally friendly house outside Bournemouth, where aides allowed him to be photographed while inspecting an organic toilet. Awkward didn't begin to cover it. Unfair perhaps, but that moment suggested all that what was wrong with his party machine, and weeks later he was gone. There is so much at stake for the Labour Party this week, that Jeremy Corbyn's \"marrow moment\" may be quickly forgotten.

Party conferences create intense, unique atmospheres where the carefully planned speeches can be overshadowed by unforeseen events, however trivial.

I recall back in 2003, watching Conservative aides cringe during a speech by their leader, Iain Duncan Smith, as he vowed the \"quiet man\" would \"turn up the volume.\" Throughout that week, Conservatives convened in corners, pondering how to replace him, with his awkward speech contributing to his eventual exit. In 2006, Cherie Blair's spontaneous and later denied remark, \"It's a lie,\" when Gordon Brown praised her husband, rapidly circulated the conference center, exposing the deep bitterness between their factions. In 2008, David Miliband's photograph clutching a banana wasn't the sole reason he made the front pages; it was his overheard comment about avoiding a \u201cHeseltine moment\u201d that highlighted his leadership ambitions, making the banana picture newsworthy.

It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. \"Think of your car in the 1970s\", David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. \"The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. \"We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology.\" Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. \"It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds\", David says.", "text_ai_base": "Once again, you sympathize with the families of those who perished and those who survived the disaster aboard these flights. Such tragedies seem relentless. Within a year, two Malaysian aircraft have vanished, along with 537 passengers. The AirAsia incident on its December route to Singapore claimed 162 lives. It's not just the crashes themselves; it's the alarming fact that entire planes are suddenly plummeting without warning. Given this, one might assume air travel is becoming increasingly perilous, but this is a misconception. When you consider the number of accidents and fatalities relative to the vast numbers flying today\u20143.2 billion passengers last year\u2014we are actually in a golden era of aviation safety. Safety analysts at Ascend report that 2014 was nearly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, an improvement over the previous year's rate of one accident per 1.91 million flights. This statistic excludes the Malaysian airliner lost over Ukraine, where 298 lives were claimed, as it is classified as a war loss rather than an accident. Even if you include that incident, the year fares relatively well historically. The Aviation Safety Network documented 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the prior year. These figures are grim, yet pale compared to 1972 when 2,370 passengers died\u2014and far fewer people flew back then, possibly only a quarter of today's numbers. Why has flying become safer? Primarily, technological advancements. David Learmount from Flightglobal illustrates, \"Think of a car in the 1970s\u2014the brakes, handling, lack of safety features. Aircraft follow a similar pattern.\" While aerodynamics were well understood by the 1940s, technological advancements have made significant impacts. Every new aircraft generation surpasses the previous in safety through better computers, designs, and materials. Yet, there's another critical aspect contributing to this safety increase: each tragedy educates designers further. A couple of decades back, Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) was the leading cause of aviation fatalities\u2014a seemingly innocuous term describing catastrophic outcomes when aircraft inadvertently collide with unseen terrain during landing, often due to nearby hills. The introduction of the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System marked a turning point in preventing such incidents. \"It's akin to a sat nav that guides flights through hills and mountains, even in cloudy conditions,\" David explains.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "You can\u2019t help but feel for the families affected by the tragic loss of these flights, both those who lost loved ones and those who narrowly survived. It doesn\u2019t seem to stop\u2014two Malaysian airplanes disappeared within a year, taking 537 passengers with them. Then there was the AirAsia accident on the way to Singapore in December, claiming 162 lives. It's not just the incidents themselves; what\u2019s terrifying is that entire planes can suddenly drop from the sky without warning. You\u2019d think air travel\u2019s getting riskier, right? Wrong. Despite these tragedies, air travel is incredibly safe these days. Last year alone, 3.2 billion passengers took to the skies. According to Ascend\u2019s safety analysts, 2014 was almost the safest year on record, with only one fatal accident for every 2.38 million flights, better than 2013\u2019s one in 1.91 million flights. The figures don\u2019t even count the Malaysian plane shot down in Ukraine, costing 298 lives\u2014that\u2019s classified as a war loss, not an accident. But even if you factor that in, historically, air travel in 2014 was safer. The Aviation Safety Network noted 21 fatal crashes that year (Ukraine included), down from 29 in 2013 and 23 in 2012. Nearly 1,000 lives were lost in 2014, which is 700 more than the previous year, but still far below the 2,370 who perished in 1972, even though four times fewer people were flying back then. So, why has flying become much safer? Mostly, it\u2019s down to technology. David Learmount from Flightglobal says something like, \"Think of 1970s cars\u2014poor brakes, iffy handling, barely any safety features. Aircraft were in the same boat.\" Sure, they got the basics of flying by the 1940s, but the tech leaps since then are what made all the difference. Each new plane model gets safer thanks to improved computers, better designs, and superior materials. Plus, we learn from each catastrophe. A couple of decades ago, Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) was the biggest killer\u2014a bland term for deadly accidents where planes unknowingly crash into terrain, usually during landing near hills. The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System changed the game. David compares it to a sat nav for airplanes, steering them clear of hills and mountains, even when visibility's poor.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.

Dr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's, said: \"It's very difficult to establish causation [with this style of study], what we're hoping that this does is really open our eyes to the possibility that tobacco could be a causative agent in psychosis, and we hope this will then lead to other research and clinical trials that would help to provide firmer evidence.\" Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk. The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking. The researchers said nicotine altered levels of the brain chemical dopamine, which has already been implicated in the psychosis. Prof Michael Owen, the director of the Institute of Psychological Medicine at Cardiff University, said the researchers had made a \"pretty strong case\" that smoking may increase the risk of schizophrenia. \"The fact is that it is very hard to prove causation without a randomised trial, but there are plenty of good reasons already for targeting public health measures very energetically at the mentally ill.\" The charity Rethink Mental Illness said: \"We know that 42% of all cigarettes smoked in England are by people with mental health problems, and so any new findings about the link between smoking and psychosis is a potential worry. \"However, longer-term studies are needed to fully understand this potential link.\"", "text_ai_base": "The team at King's College London suggests that smokers are more likely to develop schizophrenia and at a younger age.

Finally, as a bizarre conclusion to the ritual, Pastor Tsimba produced a length of pipe and held it hard against their belly buttons. One after another, he made a play of sucking hard on the pipe and in triumph then spat a lump of meat he claimed to have sucked out of them into a bowl. The meat he claimed had been been fed to them by a witch, infecting them with Kindoki. The children, bewildered and quiet, were now in his words \"delivered\".

David was born in Paris to parents who migrated from China in the early 1990s. He says he has been asked publicly if he eats dogs, and has been called a \"spring roll head\". He has also been told to \"go back to his own country\" and \"go and work with his little Chinese hands\". Such jibes might be familiar to east Asian migrants and their descendants across the West. As with British Chinese, French Chinese say that racist comments toward them are tolerated, in a way that they are not for more established migrant communities. But in France, there is a sense that Asian migrants are targeted with particularly nasty violence. \"[These attacks] are because of the beliefs they have about us,\" says David, who is too fearful to use his real name. A working-class and immigrant-heavy area, home to more than 1,200 mostly Chinese wholesalers, Aubervilliers is an important European textile centre. Buyers come from far and wide to haggle over Italian-made coats and Chinese-made shirts. Activists say at least 100 attacks against Chinese nationals were reported in the suburb in just the first seven months of this year.

While this incident happened long ago, he still feels the need to cross the road when confronted with a large group of people. This is understandable, given that everyone in his family has experienced similar targeting. France's ethnic Chinese population has endured casual racism for years and is often stereotyped as easy targets for crime, but they now feel they have reached a breaking point. In August, Zhang Chaolin, a 49-year-old tailor and father of two, lost his life in a hospital after being attacked by three teenagers in the north Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. He was kicked in the sternum, fell, and hit his head on the pavement. Allegedly, the goal of the attack was to steal his friend's bag, but Zhang only had sweets and cigarettes. This tragic event prompted over 15,000 ethnic Chinese to gather in Paris's Place de la Republique on September 4th, voicing their deep-seated insecurity.

According to British Chinese and French Chinese people, racist remarks toward their communities are tolerated more than those directed at more established migrant groups. In France, Asian migrants are perceived to be victims of particularly vicious violence. \"These attacks are rooted in their beliefs about us,\" says David, who fears using his real name. Aubervilliers, a working-class area with a significant immigrant population, is home to over 1,200 mainly Chinese wholesalers and serves as a vital European textile hub.

Over in France, the ethnic Chinese community has been putting up with casual racism for years, often seen as easy targets. But now, they've hit their limit. In August, a heartbreaking event took place: Zhang Chaolin, a 49-year-old tailor and father of two, died in a hospital after being attacked by three teenagers in Aubervilliers, a suburb in northern Paris.

But the year marked an important milestone when - aged just 22 - he broke the 800m, one mile and 1,500m world records within the space of just 41 days. He was the first person to hold all three records at the same time. He also won Sports Personality of the Year. 1980 - First Olympic medals Coe will always be remembered for his Olympic success. In 1980, amid intense rivalry with fellow British runner Steve Ovett, he won gold in the 1,500m in Moscow. He took silver in his preferred race - the 800m - finishing second to Ovett. 1984 - Second Olympic Gold Despite spending months fighting illness, Coe returned to the Olympic track in Los Angeles four years later and became the first man to win successive 1,500m golds, beating fellow Briton Steve Cram into second (Ovett failed to finish the race). Coe was beaten into second again in the 800m by Joaquim Cruz. 1992 - Enters Parliament After retiring from athletics in 1990, Coe pursued a career in politics and was chosen to fight the Falmouth and Camborne constituency for the Conservatives at the 1992 election. Coe beat the Liberal Democrat candidate by more than 3,000 votes and took his place in Parliament. He lost the seat in 1997 when Tony Blair's Labour Party swept to power. He briefly returned to politics as chief of staff to William Hague, when he was Leader of the Opposition. 2005 - Helps secure Olympics for London Despite London lagging in third place behind Paris and Madrid in early stages, the UK capital secured the games under Coe's leadership. Sports commentators said a speech he made, shortly before the vote, helped turn the race in London's favour. \"This is almost entirely on a different planet to winning the gold medals,\" Coe said at the time. He went on to become Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and is said to have been a key player in organising the Queen's appearance in the James Bond scene in the Games' opening ceremony. 2015 - Elected president of the IAAF Despite one of the most impressive CVs in athletics history, Lord Coe suggested his election as IAAF chief topped all his achievements.

In 1980, Coe cemented his Olympic legacy during the Moscow games. Despite fierce competition with his fellow Brit, Steve Ovett, Coe won gold in the 1,500m and claimed silver in his favored 800m race, where he finished behind Ovett. Four years later, in 1984, Coe overcame illness to return to the Olympic track in Los Angeles. He made history by winning a second consecutive gold in the 1,500m, beating fellow Brit Steve Cram, while Ovett was unable to finish. Coe again finished second in the 800m, this time to Joaquim Cruz.

Foreign observers didn't paint a bright picture either, noting that the election unfolded in a climate thick with fear and intimidation.

Based on a photo in Mao's Little Red Book, the portrait series is among the most famous images of the 20th Century. The auction of this work is expected to fetch as much as $15m (\u00a312.1m). This particular Mao portrait was sold in 2014 in London for \u00a37.6m ($9.4m) and the current owner, who is not identified, has now put it up for sale with Sotheby's in Hong Kong, with the auction expected on 2 April. Warhol began his series of silk-screen portraits of Mao in 1972 when ties between then cold-war foes China and US began to thaw after the historic trip to Beijing by US President Richard Nixon. The photograph that Warhol used for the portrait was one that adorned the inside cover of the so-called Little Red Book, itself an symbol of Chinese communism and a work of propaganda. More than a billion copies are thought to have been published, making the book one of the most widely produced of all time. During Mao's reign it became virtually mandatory to own and carry a copy. Warhol's Mao series led to almost 200 portraits in similar versions and sizes and follows the artist's similar earlier works on Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley in the 1960s. Picking Mao was a departure from his trademark of elevating a banal commodity (as he did with Campbell soup) or illuminating glamour (as he did with Marilyn Monroe). Chairman Mao was a political leader both deeply revered and feared and certainly an unlikely subject for the bold colour contrasts of the Pop Art movement. But it remains a delicate issue in China to this day. In a 2013 exhibition, the first comprehensive survey of Warhol's art in China, the Mao portraits were nowhere to be seen. The debate in Chinese media at the time was around whether the images were showing respect or mockery. Yet Chinese investors are increasingly buying Western art. They are thought to make up one fifth of the world's buyers of art. Downward pressure on the yuan and caps on capital outflows are only adding to the appetite for investing on the global art scene. So Warhol's portrait of China's former Communist leader may yet find its way to China through the workings of global capital markets.

The photograph Warhol employed was featured on the Little Red Book's inside cover, a symbol of Chinese communism and propaganda. Over a billion copies have been published, making it one of the most widely distributed books ever. During Mao's rule, owning and carrying a copy was nearly compulsory. Warhol's series yielded almost 200 variations and sizes, paralleling his earlier works on Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley in the 1960s. Choosing Mao marked a shift from Warhol\u2019s focus on mundane commodities or glamorous subjects. Chairman Mao was a revered yet feared political figure, an unusual choice for Pop Art\u2019s bold colors. Today, it remains a sensitive subject in China. In 2013, a major Warhol exhibition excluded the Mao portraits, sparking debate in Chinese media over whether they represented respect or satire. Nevertheless, Chinese investors are increasingly purchasing Western art, constituting about one-fifth of global art buyers. Economic pressures like the yuan's decline and capital control measures are fueling interest in international art investments.

The visiting team, strengthened by the return of six Scotland internationals and aiming for their first away victory over Leinster since 2011, broke the deadlock in the 13th minute.

Another penalty from the winger narrowed the lead by the 21st minute, crediting Aaron Dundon's efforts during a ruck penalty and precise line-out. Weir capitalized on another Leinster mistake, slotting a brilliant 43-meter penalty following a maul collapse. He repeated a similar kick six minutes before halftime after Mike McCarthy was penalized at a maul. Leinster missed an opportunity to score a third penalty when McFadden\u2019s attempt drifted wide following a yellow card issued to Pat MacArthur for a reckless tackle that sidelined Dundon. Resuming play, Leinster leveraged their numerical advantage; scrum-half McGrath initiated a play that saw Garry Ringrose sprint up the touchline, culminating in McGrath's converted try by McFadden. However, the scores were level for just six minutes. The Scots responded with strong attack sequences, culminating in Naiyaravoro's powerful try. Leinster regained the lead with a penalty try; substitute Isaac Boss found an opening leading to Isa Nacewa's kick, which Naiyaravoro was judged to have intentionally knocked over the line, leading to his sin-binning after a TMO review. McFadden's conversion gave Leinster a scoreboard edge, which they maintained when McFadden landed his third penalty.

Speedo, the biggest sponsor of the four, said: \"We cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for.\" Lochte, aged 32, said he respected Speedo's decision, and thanked the company. \"I am grateful for the opportunities that our partnership has afforded me over the years,'' he said.

After first claiming that he and his three team-mates had been robbed by bogus policemen, Lochte back-tracked and admitted he had, while still drunk, \"left details out\" and \"over-exaggerated some parts of the story\".

These included how vowels were pronounced in words such as boat, goat and coat, or stop sounds that are pronounced in words like pin, top and cat. The researchers anticipated these sounds either to be stable over time, or perhaps to be changing in the same way as in Anglo-English accents. Their evidence suggested, however, that these features and others were all changing, the changes were local to Scotland and not affected by Anglo-English changes, and that they had been happening for 100 years or more. The Glasgow team said the trigger for some of these changes appeared to be the period around the First World War. The study focused on six audio recordings, made in 1916 and held by the British Library, of Scots soldiers from German Prisoner of War camps.

Ben Shaw, director of the Policy Studies Institute, said: \"Obviously, we've got to protect children but part of their development is that we allow them to gain independence. \"People see the change from primary school to secondary school as the time to do it, but not having them do it earlier means there is a spike in road accidents at this age.\"", "text_ai_base": "In a study by University of Westminster academics involving 18,000 children aged seven to 15 from 16 countries, England ranked seventh in child independence.

While crossing roads alone is common for primary school kids, only 28% get to make their way home from school by themselves.

With the skipper alongside them, the first-team squad made so merry that one of their number failed to make the midnight flight home. European rugby officials were not amused, however.

Over the weekend, The Nation, Kenya's leading newspaper, ran a story titled \"Shame of soldiers looting Westgate.\" This footage came to light as Kenyan authorities announced they had found a body they suspect was the fourth attacker. \"Today, Sunday, October 20, 2013, we recovered a fourth body identified from CCTV footage as a terrorist,\" said Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku. \"DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We've also recovered four AK47 rifles used in the assault and 11 magazines.\" Initially, officials reported 10 to 15 gunmen, but CCTV footage seems to show only four militants. It's still unclear if some attackers got away. The Somali militant group al-Shabab claimed the attack was retaliation for Kenyan military operations in Somalia. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight disclosed that one of the suspected attackers was Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a 23-year-old Somali-born Norwegian. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he went back to Somalia in 2009 and reportedly joined al-Shabab. Sources with al-Shabab told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur, central Somalia, and took part in various operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo, becoming quite notorious in jihadist circles.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

It would mean more time for sport, but unions worry too many core curriculum subjects could dilute their importance. The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he wanted to look into how schools can increase levels of physical activity in children and young people. By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Although the need for more exercise is clear enough, it isn't just a simple matter of adding PE as a core subject. Pupils in Wales already have as core subjects Welsh, English, maths and sciences. They are the areas the government has decided should have most time and resources allocated to them. And teaching unions fear the more you add to that core, the less of a priority they each become. More than one-third are either overweight or obese, costing the Welsh NHS more than \u00a370m a year. The current core subjects in schools in Wales are English, Welsh (as a first language), mathematics, and science, while physical education is a foundation subject. Having PE elevated to a core part of the curriculum would mean more time devoted to it, as well as extra resources and more training for teachers. Schools would also need to give greater priority to provision for PE. As a result: \u2022 Teachers would be required to be competent to deliver the subject on completion of their initial teacher training. \u2022 Well qualified, specialist teachers would be needed to work with schools to ensure high-quality provision. \u2022 Standards and provision in physical education would be rigorously reviewed in school, both by the educational consortia and by schools inspectorate Estyn. \u2022 Progress would be regularly measured. The move to give PE more status in schools would be a bold move but an important one, according to the group. In its report, the group, which also included the chair of Sports Wales Laura McAllister, said: \"Given the Welsh government's commitment to making physical literacy as important a development skill as reading and writing, the group felt that changing the status of physical education is the only credible and secure way of ensuring this.\" But while teaching unions support the idea, they are worried that too many subjects on the core curriculum could dilute their importance. Dr Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, said it was important to decide on \"what small core we want\". \"We certainly want literacy and numeracy in there,\" he said. \"We may well want physical education in there too, that's for the government to decide.", "text_ai_base": "A committee led by Paralympic champion Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has proposed that Wales could be the first nation to elevate physical education (PE) to a core subject within its national curriculum. This shift would allow more time for sports in schools, but teaching unions express concerns that expanding the core curriculum might undermine the focus on existing subjects. The Welsh government has stated it will consider this recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews is keen to explore ways to boost physical activity among children and young people. Arwyn Jones, the BBC Wales education correspondent, notes that increasing exercise opportunities is essential, but simply adding PE to the core curriculum involves more complexity than it might seem. Currently, the core subjects in Wales are Welsh, English, mathematics, and science, which the government prioritizes with dedicated time and resources. Teaching unions worry that adding to the core could dilute each subject\u2019s priority. With over one-third of young people in Wales being overweight or obese, straining the NHS with costs exceeding \u00a370 million annually, promoting PE is increasingly vital. If PE becomes a core subject, schools would need to allocate more time, resources, and teacher training to it. Enhanced focus on PE would require teachers to demonstrate proficiency during initial training, bring qualified specialists into schools, and undergo rigorous assessment by educational consortia and Estyn, the schools inspectorate. Continuous monitoring of progress would also be necessary. Despite the boldness of this proposal, the group believes it's a crucial step. The report, which includes input from Sports Wales chair Laura McAllister, states that the Welsh government\u2019s commitment to physical literacy necessitates elevating PE's status as essential as reading and writing. However, while supportive, teaching unions caution against overcrowding the core curriculum. Dr. Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, emphasizes the need for a clear focus: \"We should decide on a small core. Literacy and numeracy are priorities; including PE may be wise, but it\u2019s ultimately the government\u2019s decision.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "A committee headed by Paralympic champ Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has suggested that Wales could become the first country to make physical education (PE) a core subject in its national curriculum.

The Welsh government says it will take this recommendation into consideration. Education Minister Leighton Andrews is enthusiastic about exploring ways to increase physical activity among kids and teens. BBC Wales education correspondent Arwyn Jones points out that while giving students more ways to exercise is crucial, adding PE to the core curriculum is more complicated than it appears.

Now scientists in Spain are trying to make that work easier by getting a computer to do it. The technology is being designed to automatically edit a whole game down to the key moments. The people behind it at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been working on it for a few years and have just published 18 pages of exactly how it works. Arnau Raventos is the lead professor on the project. He tells Newsbeat they have \"been working with the local television companies in Spain in order to try to make the job easier for the person who manually does the summaries currently.\" Without having to read the full report (we did that for you) - in short - it analyses what are known as key-frames. So, every part of the match is looked over by the computer to spot tell-tale signs of when something interesting is happening. That might be lots of players grouped together, lots of zoomed-in action, extra noise from the crowd or the sound of the referee's whistle. Arnau calls them \"occasions\". \"We want to find specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal is an occasion.\" We thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that. There is a long way to go though. The technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in.

However, scientists in Spain are working to streamline this process by developing a computer capable of doing the task. This technology aims to automatically edit games by identifying crucial highlights. Researchers at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been developing this system for several years and have recently published an 18-page report detailing its mechanics. Arnau Raventos, the lead professor on the project, shared with Newsbeat that they are collaborating with local television companies in Spain to simplify the job for those who currently edit game summaries manually. Here\u2019s a brief overview of how it works: the system analyzes what are known as key-frames. The computer examines every segment of the match to detect indicators of significant events, such as clusters of players, zoomed-in action, heightened crowd noise, or the sound of the referee\u2019s whistle. Arnau refers to these instances as \"occasions.\" He explains, \"We aim to identify specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal qualifies as an occasion.\" For instance, suppose a defender falls in the penalty box\u2014everyone gathers, a whistle blows, faces fill the shot, and a penalty occurs. Theoretically, this technology should capture such moments. Nevertheless, the system is still in development, and even casual football fans might find its current limitations frustrating, as it hasn't yet consistently detected the exact moment a goal is scored. In trials across five matches, the technology identified 70% of the goals. \"We need to be honest,\" says Arnau. \"Currently, it's not feasible to create a fully automatic summary that catches every goal.\" Despite this, the technology effectively discards non-essential moments, like panoramic views, which simplifies the editor\u2019s task.

At least officially, he is not a citizen of the country he calls home. He was born and raised in Nepal and plays for the national team. He has an Indian father and a Nepali mother, so getting citizenship should not be a problem according to the law of the land. But his efforts to acquire Nepalese citizenship so far have been futile. \"It's been almost eight to nine years that I've been trying to get my citizenship. I'm still facing problems. It's really frustrating at times,\" he says. A few years ago, he was given a travel document as a special concession so he could play in matches abroad. Bridging India's identity divide A life without identity Identity in pictures A game changer? Pakistan's identity management In Nepal, you can usually apply for citizenship at the age of 16 as long as your father or mother is able to sign the official document, according to the Nepali Citizenship Act of 2006. But in practice, women in this patriarchal society still face a lot of discrimination when passing down citizenship to their children, specially in the absence of the father or if the father is not a Nepali citizen. A lack of citizenship document can make your life tough - you cannot get a driving licence, open a bank account, pursue higher education or carry out legal transactions. And according to the United Nations, the number of people grappling with this problem is far from small. \"We estimate from the numbers we've seen that this is quite a big problem,\" says Robert Piper, the UN Resident Humanitarian Co-ordinator. \"In the Election Commission's findings, more than 2 million people they interviewed - people just from the villages, not the urban areas - were actually unable to show their citizenship documents,\" adds Mr Piper. Usha Kala Rai, a member of the now dissolved Constituent Assembly, believes that Nepal's bureaucratic system discriminates against women. \"Many women are victims of violence and discrimination. Specially those who have gone abroad for work, victims of rape, women who were abandoned, those forced to leave home and divorcees - all risk being deprived of their identity,\" she says. Bhagwati Chettri, 55, a Nepali, was abandoned by her husband several years ago. She does not have her own citizenship document because she failed to acquire one from either her parents or her husband before he left her. This means that her two children, who are just coming of age, have no legal identity either. \"I have been trying for the last eight years to get a citizenship certificate.", "text_ai_base": "Sharad Bheswakar, a leading cricketer and sports icon in Nepal, faces an unusual dilemma: despite being born and raised in Nepal and playing for its national team, he is not officially recognized as a Nepali citizen.

Under the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from \u00a362.70 to \u00a373.10 a week. Ministers say they will spend an extra \u00a32bn on social care over three years. Carer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week. Eligible carers cannot earn more than \u00a3116 a week after tax. Mr Corbyn said he believed it \"would be a good thing to do\" to help carers, \"usually women\" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home. \"Caring for people is stressful,\" he told the BBC. \"In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.\" In his speech later, the Labour leader will claim \"Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting \u00a34.6bn from council care budgets\". \"Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,\" he will say. \"The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers \u00a3132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support. \"That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of \u00a310 a week. \"We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain. \"This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.\" According to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost \u00a3538m by 2020/21. This would be covered by scrapping the expected \u00a3650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth \u00a31m free of death duties. But the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance. Luke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \"Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do. \"That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional \u00a3450 a year for carers since 2010.", "text_ai_base": "Jeremy Corbyn is set to announce during his visit to Birmingham on Tuesday that a Labour government would increase Carer's Allowance by 17%, benefiting around one million people in its first year. This proposal aims to raise the weekly allowance from \u00a362.70 to \u00a373.10. The government plans an additional \u00a32 billion investment in social care over three years. Currently, Carer's Allowance supports about 6.5 million UK residents who care for elderly, disabled, or seriously ill friends or relatives for a minimum of 35 hours weekly, earning no more than \u00a3116 after tax. Mr. Corbyn views the increase as a means to assist carers, primarily women, who often resign from their jobs to care for elderly family members at home. He told the BBC that while caring can be rewarding, it shouldn't lead to financial hardship or isolation. In his upcoming speech, the Labour leader will blame \"Britain's social care crisis\" on Downing Street's \u00a34.6 billion cut to council care budgets, resulting in unpaid carers shouldering more responsibility. He will emphasize that the care provided by these carers saves taxpayers \u00a3132 billion annually, and that these often unrecognized heroes deserve not just praise, but essential financial support. Labour believes that a \u00a310 weekly boost to Carer's Allowance is both moral and economically sound. Corbyn advocates funding this increase by reversing the Conservative cut on inheritance tax, which only benefits Britain's wealthiest. He sees this move as a pivotal step toward modernizing the social care system and bolstering support for family carers. Labour estimates adjusting Carer's Allowance will cost \u00a3538 million by 2020/21, funded by canceling the anticipated \u00a3650 million inheritance tax cut for estates up to \u00a31 million passed between married couples without death duties.

Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks.

The two countries agreed \"to put in motion\" a deal that allows about 50 Bangladeshi enclaves inside India to be integrated within Bangladesh and about 100 Indian areas inside Bangladesh to become part of India. Officials say that under the terms of a protocol between the two leaders - the details of which will be worked out at a later date - residents of these areas will have the right to decide whether they want to become Indians or Bangladeshis. BBC Bengali editor Sabir Mustafa says that the failure to reach agreement over sharing water from the Teesta river is a big setback for Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, who has staked much of her personal reputation on securing a deal. By Sabir Mustafa BBC Bengali editor There is little doubt that relations between the two countries are at their closest since the early 1970s when India helped Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan. But the warmth in relations is also serving to mask a growing unease in both countries about the nature of the relationship. There are worries that the Indian leadership may have invested all its goodwill in one political party in Bangladesh, namely the Awami League led by current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. As a result, whenever the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP comes to power, relations could take a nose dive. There is also concern in Bangladesh that Sheikh Hasina appears too eager to accommodate Indian demands. The visit lost much of its lustre when the Indian side made it clear at the last minute there would not be any agreement on the sharing of a major river. It has also taken some of the gloss off the first visit to Bangladesh by an Indian prime minister for 12 years. All the two sides could agree on this issue was a commitment to revisit it at a later date. Prime Minister Singh told reporters after the talks that \"substantial progress has been made on sharing water of common rivers\". He said further discussion was needed. It is widely thought that the deal fell through because of last-minute objections to it from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was reported to believe that India was in danger of supplying too much water to Bangladesh.", "text_ai_base": "The two countries were unable to sign an agreement on sharing river water due to objections from the chief minister of West Bengal, India. Additionally, there was no arrangement for India to gain overland access through Bangladesh to its northeastern states. However, there was positive news for tens of thousands of \"stateless border people.\" The countries agreed to initiate a deal where approximately 50 Bangladeshi enclaves within India would be integrated into Bangladesh, and around 100 Indian areas in Bangladesh would become part of India. According to officials, residents of these areas will be allowed to choose whether they want to become Indian or Bangladeshi as part of a protocol between the leaders, with details to be finalized later. BBC Bengali editor Sabir Mustafa points out that failing to reach an agreement on sharing Teesta river water is a significant setback for Bangladesh's PM Sheikh Hasina, who had invested her reputation in securing the deal. Mustafa also notes that current relations between the two countries are the closest since the early 1970s when India aided Bangladesh\u2019s independence from Pakistan. However, this warmth is overshadowing a growing unease about the relationship's nature. Concerns exist that India's leadership might be aligning too closely with Bangladesh's Awami League, led by PM Sheikh Hasina. This could lead to strained relations if the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) gains power. Additionally, there is concern in Bangladesh over Sheikh Hasina's perceived eagerness to fulfill Indian demands. The visit's significance diminished when India indicated at the last moment that a major river-sharing agreement wouldn\u2019t be reached, taking away some of the shine from the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Bangladesh in 12 years. Both sides agreed only to revisit this issue later. Prime Minister Singh stated post-talks that \"substantial progress has been made on sharing water of common rivers,\" though further discussion is needed.

Plus, there wasn't any deal for granting India overland access through Bangladesh to its northeastern states. On a brighter note, a good number of \"stateless border people\" found a silver lining. The two nations decided to proceed with integrating roughly 50 Bangladeshi enclaves in India with Bangladesh and about 100 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh with India. Folks living in these areas can choose to be citizens of either country, but the finer points still need to be sorted out. According to Sabir Mustafa, the BBC Bengali editor, the failure to seal the Teesta river water-sharing agreement is a big blow for Bangladesh's PM Sheikh Hasina, who's put a lot on the line to get this deal done. Mustafa also mentions that, right now, India and Bangladesh have the closest ties since the 1970s when India helped Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan. This coziness, however, masks growing discomfort about the relationship's direction. There are fears that India's leaders might be cosying up too much to Bangladesh's Awami League, which could spell trouble if the opposition party BNP comes to power. Over in Bangladesh, there\u2019s a bit of worry about Sheikh Hasina's eagerness to cater to India\u2019s demands. The whole visit lost its edge when India abruptly announced that the major river-sharing agreement was off the table, dampening the excitement of the Indian prime minister's first visit to Bangladesh in 12 years.

Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.", "text_ai_base": "Kepler-452b orbits a star at a similar distance to Earth\u2019s orbit, although its radius is 60% larger than Earth\u2019s.

NASA's John Grunsfeld didn't hold back, dubbing the planet \"Earth 2.0\" and saying it's the closest companion to Earth we've found so far. Sitting approximately 1,400 light-years away, Kepler-452b was brought to our attention by Jon Jenkins, who heads up Kepler data analysis at NASA's Ames Research Center. He described it as a \"new kid on the block,\" highlighting its debut among other Earth-like finds such as Kepler-186f, which made waves in 2014.

In that nail-biting match, with just four minutes to go, Blackman again showcased his talent by blocking Brad Potts' penalty to secure a draw. Early in the game, Adebayo Akinfenwa had the first crack at scoring but sent the ball wide. Potts kept pressing and tried a speculative shot about midway through the first half, which nicked the crossbar. Then, right before halftime, Paris Cowan-Hall fired a low shot that was expertly saved by Blackpool's goalie, Dean Lyness. After the break, Potts made another attempt that was dramatically cleared off the line by Blackman, even as Blackpool insisted it had crossed over. Blackman's heroics peaked in the dying moments when he fantastically blocked Potts\u2019 close-range effort. So the match ended in a stalemate: Wycombe Wanderers 0, Blackpool 0. During the second half, Luke O'Nien of Wycombe earned a free kick in defense after getting fouled by Neil Danns of Blackpool. Michael Harriman from Wycombe committed a foul too, giving Danns a free kick on the right flank. Wycombe switched up their lineup, bringing Sam Saunders in for Sam Wood. Some more rough play followed, with a Jack Payne foul giving Joe Jacobson a free kick for Wycombe. Then, Blackpool got a penalty when Max M\u00fcller fouled in the box, but Potts' shot was stopped in the bottom right corner. Another twist came when Jamille Matt was fouled in Wycombe's area. Myles Weston almost shocked everyone with a header that narrowly missed. Wycombe made another swap, putting Alex Jakubiak in for Paris Cowan-Hall. On the fouling front, Cowan-Hall won a defensive free kick thanks to Tom Aldred\u2019s mistake. Luke O'Nien ended up with a yellow card for a particularly nasty foul. Blackpool\u2019s defense got a breather with a free kick won by Will Aimson, and they substituted Danns out for Jordan Flores and Matt with Mark Cullen. Jack Payne had a shot from outside the box, but it didn't find the target. Later, Cowan-Hall won another free kick following a foul by Kelvin Mellor. Nathan Delfouneso\u2019s shot from the center was blocked.

Lewes Crown Court heard that rather than having Asperger's syndrome he had an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that was undiagnosed for years. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Roderick Ley made the assessment after the stabbing. Mr Lock, a retired solicitor, was stabbed after crashing at about 16mph into the back of Mr Daley's car on the A24 in West Sussex on 16 July. He was forced to brake suddenly after Mr Daley made an emergency stop. The great-grandfather, who had recently been given the all-clear from prostate cancer, died at the scene. The trial has heard how Mr Daley, formerly of St Elmo Road, Worthing, had been suffering from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had \"pleaded\" with experts to section him. On Monday, Dr Ley told jurors: \"It's clear that the diagnosis of Asperger's was wrong. \"He has an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that was undiagnosed for many, many years.\" He said Mr Daley was not psychotic every moment of every day, and he would often \"downplay\" his symptoms.

Another expert, consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph, said he was satisfied on all the evidence he had seen that Mr Daley was not psychotic at the time of the killing. Jurors also head from Mr Daley's father, who said his son had never been a violent person. John Daley described him as a \"nice guy\" who was affectionate to his family and animals. He said Mr Daley was \"scrupulously honest in all his dealings with others, honest to a fault in that he finds it difficult to lie about things\". He told the court that he first became worried about his son's mental health when he reported hearing voices. Mr Daley said he started a journal, partly to keep track of his son's treatment. \"The second reason for having the document was, as time went on, it was clear that Matthew's life expectations were draining away and I didn't want to be in my 80s and look back saying, 'What did I do'?\" The trial continues.", "text_ai_base": "Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but acknowledges attacking Donald Lock, 79, in Findon near Worthing last July, claiming diminished responsibility.

Yet, when banter turned to facing Parker, Bellew remarked, \"I trust Eddie knows what he's doing.\" Hearn confirmed there's no Bellew-Joshua clash on the horizon, casually noting on BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek that \"Tony and Joshua are good friends.\" Now, Bellew, who used to roll in the cruiserweight category, isn't quite a natural at heavyweight. He moved up just to tackle David Haye in March and clocked in at 96.6 kg for that bout. Meanwhile, Joshua bulked up to a career-high 113 kg against Klitschko\u2014a solid 20 kg heavier. Bellew's gaze partly rests on WBC heavyweight champ Deontay Wilder. Wilder's itching for a unification fight with Joshua if he snags the WBO belt from Parker. \"I plan to secure the WBO belt, and after dealing with any mandatory challengers, aim for a major fight early in 2018,\" Wilder declared with determination.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

His wife told BBC Persian about the incident. \"I told one of them, for God's sake, I have just given birth, I'm like your child, even your daughter is older than me,\" she said. \"I cried a lot, they beat me all over my head and body,\" she said. \"Their bite marks were still on my body until a couple of years ago.\" Analysis: Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Pashto The stand taken by Jahangir and his wife breaks something of a taboo in Afghanistan, where victims of sexual crime are generally cowed into silence. Soon after the media picked up the case, President Ghani spoke with Jahangir and promised him that \"the case will be investigated properly and perpetrators will face justice\". The victim herself told the BBC: \"I want justice to save other women from such a fate.\" In the wake of the publicity, the Afghan government will be under pressure to investigate the incident properly and ensure some kind of resolution. But there are also hopes that the stand taken by Jahangir and his wife will embolden other victims of sexual crime, and have a lasting affect on how such cases are dealt with. Jahangir, a policeman, told the BBC eight men were arrested after the incident, but six have now been freed because of their political connections.

But there is certainly a view that the currency would decline if Britain were to decide to leave. Some analysts expect the fall in the value of sterling in the event of a Brexit vote would be very sharp . The concern reflects the view held by many - though by no means all - economists that leaving the EU would undermine the UK's economic performance. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU. There would be a period of uncertainty about access to the EU market for British exporters while new arrangements were negotiated. The ultimate result could be that it would be harder to sell to the EU market. It is argued that foreign investment could be hit by the uncertainty. This would be going on at a time when the UK has a large deficit in what is called \"the current account deficit\" - which is trade in goods and services plus some international financial transactions. The deficit has to be financed by loans and foreign investment in financial assets. Unease about the economic outlook could mean that foreign investors would only provide the finance for the deficit if sterling were cheaper. There is of course another view, reflected by Economists for Brexit that the UK would prosper outside the EU. For the short term however, it is more likely to be the majority view that moves markets and sterling in particular. Our reporting on the currency markets usually focuses on what's called the spot rates, the exchange rate that an investor pays to buy currency immediately. But they can also buy options, which are rights to buy or sell a currency (or other types of financial asset) in the future at a price fixed in advance. It's a way of getting insurance against a move in the exchange rate. If the move you are worried about doesn't happen you don't exercise the option. So you are insured, but you have had to pay for it. That part of the market suggests that investors do think a leave vote would weaken sterling.", "text_ai_base": "Sterling initially regained some of its losses, yet many believe the currency would drop if Britain decided to leave the EU. Analysts predict a sharp decline in sterling's value should a Brexit vote occur. This concern stems from the belief held by many\u2014though not all\u2014economists that exiting the EU would harm the UK's economic performance. EU membership impacts trade and the UK economy significantly. During the negotiation of new arrangements, there would be uncertainty about British exporters' access to the EU market, possibly making it more difficult to sell to this market. Additionally, foreign investment may suffer due to this uncertainty, worsening the situation as the UK faces a large current account deficit, which encompasses trade in goods and services along with some international financial transactions. This deficit requires financing through loans and foreign investment in financial assets, and apprehensions about economic prospects might lead foreign investors to demand lower sterling prices to finance the deficit. There is an alternative view, notably from Economists for Brexit, that the UK would thrive outside the EU. However, in the short term, the prevailing view affecting markets, especially sterling, is likely the majority opinion. Our currency market reports typically emphasize spot rates, immediate exchange rates for currency purchases. Investors can also buy options\u2014rights to buy or sell currency (or other financial assets) in the future at a predetermined price. Options provide insurance against exchange rate fluctuations.

This worry comes from the general belief among economists\u2014though opinions vary\u2014that leaving the EU would hurt the UK's economy. Membership in the EU plays a vital role in shaping trade and the broader economic landscape in the UK. With new deals on the table, uncertainty looms over whether British exporters will retain easy access to EU markets, possibly throwing a wrench in selling goods there. On top of that, foreign investment might take a hit due to this uncertainty, worsening matters given the UK's sizeable current account deficit, which covers trade in goods and services, plus some financial transactions internationally. This deficit gets funded via loans and foreign investments in financial assets, and jittery investors might prefer lower sterling prices to fund it. Of course, there's a counter-argument from groups like Economists for Brexit, who suggest the UK could flourish outside the EU. But for now, the short-term buzz in markets, particularly concerning sterling, seems rooted in what's considered the mainstream view. When we talk about currency market reports, the focus is often on spot rates\u2014those immediate exchange rates where currency buys happen. Investors have another tool: options, which allow them to buy or sell currency (or other financial assets) later on at a set price.

There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity. I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal. Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans. They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the \"noise\" of national campaigning. That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities. On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South. There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools. But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university? The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years. It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students. One angry voice in the audience shouted: \"That's outrageous and disgraceful\". It got backing from the Greens. \"That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market,\" said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley. There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff. A precise solution perhaps required a precise response. But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one. \"It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party,\" she told the questioner. And Labour's Dame Margaret? \"We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating.", "text_ai_base": "At the heart of the media's frustration lies the tightly controlled nature of modern political campaigns, dominated by carefully staged photo opportunities from all major parties. This election season could be dubbed the \"hi-vis, hard hat campaign,\" particularly for figures like David Cameron and George Osborne, who have avoided spontaneous interactions with the public to prevent unexpected challenges from voters. Yet, there is an intriguing aspect of this election that offers a glimpse of authentic, unfiltered politics: the election hustings. These events have been a notable success this general election season. The origin of the term 'hustings' piques curiosity, and according to research by a Christian charity, a record number of these events have been hosted in churches. Having attended several hustings, I can attest that their effectiveness stems from the direct and often personal nature of the debates. Voters actively engage politicians, cutting through campaign sound bites to address overlooked issues. This dynamic was evident at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ Church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience largely consisted of African Caribbean community members. Politicians from all parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, present to defend her 6,000-vote Labour majority, fielded questions on immigration, Europe, and education. One question, however, resonated deeply: Why are African Caribbean graduates three times more likely to be unemployed six months post-graduation? Research by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, involving 2,500 students over two years, revealed the disparity in opportunities offered to black students versus their white counterparts. An outraged audience member declared, \"That's outrageous and disgraceful,\" drawing support from the Green Party. Green candidate John Devine, seeking election in Derbyshire's Amber Valley, responded, \"That indicates some form of discrimination in the job market.\" There was a call for employers to be legally required to audit their hiring practices. This complex issue required a nuanced response, yet Evonne Williams, the Conservative candidate for Derby South, carefully avoided commitment, saying, \"It's something we haven't considered, but I'm happy to take it back to the party.\" As for Labour's Dame Margaret, she promised to review the Equalities Act to determine if it requires modernization and updates.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "At the core of the media\u2019s irritation is the tightly controlled, almost choreographed nature of today's political campaigns. They're packed with perfectly staged photo ops from all major parties. This election season feels like it should be called the \"hi-vis, hard hat campaign,\" especially with folks like David Cameron and George Osborne steering clear of unscripted interactions with the public to dodge any curveballs voters might throw their way. But hey, there\u2019s a silver lining\u2014a chance to glimpse some real, unvarnished politics: the election hustings. These events have been a big hit this general election season. The term 'hustings' might stir some curiosity, and it turns out, a Christian charity\u2019s research shows a record number of these have taken place in churches. I\u2019ve been to a few hustings myself, and their strength lies in the raw, straightforward nature of the debates. You\u2019ve got voters directly grilling politicians, slicing right through the usual campaign rhetoric to confront issues often left in the shadows. This was crystal clear at a hustings held at All Nations for Christ Church in Normanton, part of the Derby South constituency. The audience was predominantly from the African Caribbean community. Politicians from various parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, there to defend her Labour majority of 6,000 votes, faced questions on pressing topics like immigration, Europe, and education. One particular question that really hit home was: Why are African Caribbean graduates three times more likely to be unemployed six months after graduating? Research conducted by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a charity focused on youth employment, studied 2,500 students over two years and uncovered glaring differences in job opportunities for black students compared to their white peers. An audience member, clearly angry, declared, \"That's outrageous and disgraceful,\" which got a nod of approval from the Green Party. Green candidate John Devine, who\u2019s running in Derbyshire's Amber Valley, chimed in, \"That shows there\u2019s discrimination in the job market.\" There were calls for legislation to make sure employers audit their hiring practices. This complicated issue needed a thoughtful approach, but Evonne Williams, the Conservative candidate for Derby South, hesitated to offer a solid plan, saying, \"It's something we haven't considered, but I'm happy to take it back to the party.\" As for Labour\u2019s Dame Margaret, she pledged to look over the Equalities Act to see if it needs a makeover.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

His experience tallies with that of French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, who described being backed up against the metal door, and getting no response to passengers' desperate calls for help. The drama unfolded on board a high-speed train travelling from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday. Mr Robinson realised something was wrong shortly after the Thalys train went through Brussels. He saw three members of the train's staff run through his coach, carriage 11, which was the next compartment along from carriage 12, where the gunman emerged. \"They said nothing. They were a man followed by two women,\" he says. \"They looked scared, they didn't alert us to anything, they ran to the end of my carriage and used their key to open a service door. Then they locked the door after them.\" Carriage 11 was in the front half of the train and the locked door allowed staff access to a service area, which was off limits to passengers. Then other people started running through from carriage 12. Some were covered in blood, others said they had seen a man with a gun shooting people. \"There we were, with nowhere to go. There were probably 20 to 30 of of us, including the French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade and his family. We didn't know anything.\" Anglade, who injured his hand as he tried to activate the train's alarm, has also spoken about members of train staff locking themselves in a private cabin, complaining that they could have led passengers to a luggage area in another part of the train. He told Paris Match (in French) \"We shouted for the staff to let us in, we yelled 'open!' There was no response.\" Agnes Ogier, the boss of Thalys, has said there will be an internal investigation and the staff involved will be asked to \"explain their behaviour during this dramatic event\". Jamie Robinson says after 10 terrifying minutes a man entered their carriage and explained there had been a man with a gun but the situation was now under control. Afterwards he learned this was Anthony Sadler, one of the American passengers who helped overpower the attacker. \"The relief just exploded. We were all in such painful shock,\" he recalls.

Some of Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric cast doubt over long-standing US alliances, including with Japan. The meeting was Mr Trump's first face-to-face with a world leader since winning the presidential election. The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy. The president-elect has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr Abe strenuously supports as a means of countering China's growing economic strength. The deal was approved by the Japanese parliament, despite the likelihood that it would be cancelled when Mr Trump takes office. Mr Trump has also said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil, and has floated the idea that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korean missiles. The meeting was reportedly arranged when Mr Abe rang the president-elect to congratulate him, mentioning that he would be passing through New York on the way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Abe said: \"We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time. We held it in a very warm atmosphere. \"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations the alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence.\" The Japanese leader gave few details of the meeting but added the two agreed to meet again for deeper talks on a wider range of issues.

The accelerated meltdown of glaciers in the region is causing concern against a backdrop of rising global temperatures. Scientists say the warning is the first of its kind for Khumbu, although other glaciers in the Himalayas have seen an increase in the number of lakes formed. Such newly formed glacial lakes can overflow causing flooding, and with it loss of life and damage downstream. This is the first scientific team to visit the region after the devastating earthquake last April. \"A decade or so ago, there were individual ponds on the Khumbu glacier but in the past five years or so they have begun to get larger and join up,\" said Ann Rowan, who led the field study team from the universities of Sheffield and Leeds. Dr Rowan's team has been studying the behaviour of debris-covered glaciers, focusing on Khumbu. \"Particularly, on the left hand side of the lower reaches of the glacier, there is a series of about seven or eight large ponds that are now starting to link and form a big chain,\" she told the BBC. \"There is water flowing from the upper part of the glacier through the series of these ponds and that is going to encourage them to join up. \"At present, the glacier appears to be disintegrating, and may form a few large and potentially hazardous lakes on the glacier surface.\" Dr Rowan's team has studied satellite images of the Khumbu glacier dating back 15 years and has also conducted three ground surveys since 2009. The scientists found that parts of the lower region of the debris-covered glacier have been shrinking because of loss of ice underneath. This has allowed the formation and expansion of water bodies. The study says measurements for the past 15 years show that the surface of the debris-covered glacier has been declining at the rate of two metres per year. Unlike the usually smooth-iced glaciers elsewhere, many in the Himalayan region are debris covered, meaning they are coated by a layer of sand, gravel and rock. Scientists say since the upper parts of many Himalayan glaciers are losing ice mass due to rising temperatures.

But transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were \"energised and excited about their new role serving the country\" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media. \"First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world,\" wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. \"Melania Trump's decision is appalling.\" Others joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage. However, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence. But Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters. \"Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,\" one Twitter user noted. However, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers. But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before? William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season. The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as \"Oak View\" but it was more commonly known as \"Red Top\" because of its red roof. But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House. \"The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,\" Mr Seale said. \"It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising.\" Mr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House.", "text_ai_base": "The president-elect mentioned that Mrs. Trump and Barron would relocate to Washington \"very soon, after he's finished with school,\" though no specific date has been set.

On Thursday morning, the Daily Mail devoted an entire page to an editorial taking umbrage, to put it mildly, with a Guardian cartoon suggesting the attacker at Finsbury Park mosque may have been indoctrinated by reading that paper and The Sun. I tweeted about that battle here. But the issue that most interests me is that Facebook and Google have been getting it in the neck for not doing more to remove far-right material online glorifying the attack. In recent months, political pressure has mounted on these two tech giants, as well as other smaller firms, to ensure that the internet is not a \"safe space\" for terrorists. That old political instinct that Something Must Be Done has kicked into overdrive. At a recent press conference, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron committed not only to working together on this issue, but introducing fines if companies didn't act faster to remove hateful material. It is interesting that this political pressure has been re-applied in the light of an attack by a white man on Muslims. It suggests that the scope of material on the web that could meet with popular disapproval is vast. Will an anti-Semitic attack prompt demands that Facebook and Google act on anti-Semitism? Could a rise in sectarian hatred in India prompt demands in that country for, say, Hindu nationalist content to be removed? Perhaps so. Which means this is a good time to remind you of the complexity of this issue and why, though I certainly don't instinctively take the side of the most powerful companies in the world, it's important to be clear about the implications of turning our Something Must Be Done ire against them. First of all, we have to separate the issue of encryption from the broader one about hateful content. At times, leading British politicians haven't seemed to grasp the difference. Messaging apps like WhatsApp are attractive to terrorists because they are protected at both ends: security services can't easily infiltrate them. But if you undermine that protection by creating a so-called back door to encryption, that is an invitation to all sorts of nasties - from foreign powers to cyber-criminals - to take advantage. On the issue of what to do about hateful material, the problems with clamping down on it are several, and both practical and philosophical. Practically speaking, the sheer volume of content is impossible to manage, probably even with Artificial Intelligence.", "text_ai_base": "To illustrate, someone on Twitter commented on The Times's front page, noting: \"He's white, so let's highlight that he's jobless, a lone wolf, and has mental health issues.\" The Times was far from the only publication facing such criticism. On Thursday morning, the Daily Mail dedicated an entire page to an editorial expressing strong displeasure with a Guardian cartoon suggesting the Finsbury Park mosque attacker was influenced by reading their paper and The Sun. I also tweeted about this issue. However, what captivates me most is the criticism aimed at Facebook and Google for not doing enough to remove online far-right material that glorifies the attack. Recently, political pressure has intensified on these tech giants, along with smaller firms, to ensure the internet isn\u2019t a \"safe space\" for terrorists. The political instinct that Something Must Be Done has surged dramatically. At a recent press conference, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron pledged not only collaboration on this matter but also fines for companies that delay removing hateful content. This pressure has re-emerged following an attack by a white man on Muslims, suggesting a broad scope of web content could face disapproval. Will an anti-Semitic attack lead to demands for Facebook and Google to address anti-Semitism? Could rising sectarian tensions in India lead to calls for the removal of Hindu nationalist content? Possibly. It's crucial to grasp the complexity of this issue and consider the consequences of directing our demands for action toward these powerful companies. First, we must distinguish between the issue of encryption and the broader one of hateful content\u2014a distinction some British politicians have overlooked. Messaging apps like WhatsApp appeal to terrorists because they offer end-to-end encryption, making infiltration by security services difficult.

Republican voters may be \"idiots\", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population \"swing\" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. \"The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy,\" he writes. \"Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations.\" Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. \"We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win,\" Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. \"Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan.", "text_ai_base": "The Republican Party is deeply divided. The rhetoric from its members is often too inflammatory. While some might claim Republican voters are \"idiots,\" the general public tends to be more discerning. The US electoral map favors candidates who win key high-population \"swing\" states, making it challenging for Republicans. Consider this: a recent survey of three critical swing states\u2014Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\u2014shows a virtual tie between the two prospective nominees. These states, which hold a combined 67 electoral votes, supported Democrat Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. If added to the states Mitt Romney won in 2012, the total rises to 273 electoral votes\u2014three more than needed to secure the presidency. Furthermore, a national tracking poll released on Wednesday shows Donald Trump closing in on Hillary Clinton, causing significant concern among Democrats. However, more rational voices point to the fact that the Reuters/Ipsos national poll, showing Clinton at 41% versus Trump\u2019s 40% with 19% undecided, was conducted online. The Quinnipiac swing-state poll also heavily sampled white voters, who tend to lean Republican, suggesting that Trump's support might not be growing as much as it appears. Election analyst Nate Silver cautions against jumping to conclusions based on these polls, reminding us that the election will have many ups and downs, and polls can be unpredictable. Although political analysts obsess over every poll, the indication that Trump is competitive with Clinton should question early predictions of a landslide for the Democrats. Trump has a path to the presidency. While it's improbable, it exists. This potential path hinges on the Rust Belt\u2014states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, with its rapidly expanding Hispanic population, sides with Clinton, Trump could win if he takes those states. He seems aware of this strategy. \"We'll win places many say you can't win, like Michigan,\" Trump asserted at an April rally in Indiana.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "The Republican Party is in a bit of a mess right now, with lots of infighting and fiery rhetoric flying around. Sure, some folks might go as far as to call Republican voters \"idiots,\" but most people are a tad more discerning than that. What's really tricky for Republicans is the US electoral map. Winning key, high-population swing states is crucial, and it's not easy. Here's a thought: a recent poll from three swing states\u2014Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\u2014shows the two leading nominees are neck and neck. These three states, boasting a total of 67 electoral votes, backed Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Now, if you add them to the states Mitt Romney bagged in 2012, you get 273 electoral votes, which is three more than the magic number to land the presidency. In the national scene, a tracking poll released on Wednesday has Donald Trump narrowing the gap with Hillary Clinton, which is making Democrats a bit jittery. Yet, cooler heads note that the Reuters/Ipsos poll, with Clinton at 41% and Trump at 40% and 19% undecided, was done online. Then there\u2019s the Quinnipiac swing-state poll, which had a bigger sample of white voters who generally favor Republicans. This implies that Trump's apparent surge might not be quite what it seems. Nate Silver, the well-known election analyst, warns us not to leap to big conclusions from these polls, reminding everyone about the rollercoaster nature of elections where anything can happen. While political junkies are glued to every poll, the fact that Trump is giving Clinton a run for her money raises doubts about those early forecasts of a Democratic landslide. Trump does have a shot at the presidency. It might be a long shot, but it's there. His potential success hinges largely on the Rust Belt\u2014states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, with its booming Hispanic population, leans towards Clinton, Trump can still clinch victory by flipping those Rust Belt states. And he knows it. \"We\u2019ll win places many say you can\u2019t win, like Michigan,\" Trump confidently proclaimed at a rally in Indiana back in April.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

Farrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try. I would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England. I would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, \"I need to be in the game more\". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that. Henry Slade is your dream but he is injured.

The 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph. It revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith. Pembrokeshire council said \"it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice\". Smith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012. During that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings. Allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home. The report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith \"displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time\". Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy. He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child. He also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children. The report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer. The fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application. The report said the head of service had \"replied in very positive terms\". A formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to \"highlight any concerns\" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes. The head of service left the section blank. It was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined. The panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer. \"By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action,\" the report said. \"It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005\" and \"only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer\".", "text_ai_base": "An investigation into Pembrokeshire council's interactions with Michael Smith reveals that his foster carer application was halted merely by chance.

The Western Telegraph got its hands on a confidential report from 2015, which spilled the beans on a pretty big oversight. Apparently, the head of service failed to mention some major child protection issues concerning Smith. The council wasn't too happy about this report getting out; they called it an unfortunate leak, since someone inside shared it despite being told not to. Smith was in Haverfordwest, working with the council's youth department from May 2001 until January 2012. During that time, he had three disciplinary hearings. The allegations were quite serious: he let a kid drive his Land Rover, allowed one without a seatbelt, and even let a youth reported missing stay at his house. The independent social worker's report pointed out that Smith showed several grooming behaviors, although formal abuse charges weren't filed back then. His stint with the council ended with a dismissal for gross misconduct. Things escalated in September 2013 when the police started investigating him on accusations of sexually abusing a boy. Fast forward to July 2014, Smith found himself facing a six-year prison sentence. He pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a child under 13, encouraging sexual activity, and taking indecent photographs. He also confessed to having 1,136 indecent images of children. Back in 2010, he put in an application to become a respite foster carer with the council. The fostering team reached out to the Head of Youth Service for feedback on Smith. Oddly, the head\u2019s response was \"very positive,\" even skipping over some important parts. When asked to list any concerns, including past disciplinary actions, he left it blank. Thank goodness one of the foster panel members had a good memory. When the application came up, they recalled Smith's previous investigation in 2005 for inappropriate behavior.

Elyse Villani shone with a half-century, the first in a final, scoring 52 off just 34 balls. Yet, the highlight was the dynamism of 18-year-old Windies opener Hayley Matthews, who delivered a spectacular 66 off 45 balls, including three sixes, in a pivotal 120-run partnership. The West Indies secured victory with three balls remaining, and their men's team later achieved a T20 double triumph. Despite losing all eight previous T20 internationals against Australia, the West Indies faced nerves as they bowled on the prestigious grounds of Eden Gardens. Villani capitalized on errant full tosses to reach her fifty swiftly, and Meg Lanning contributed with three consecutive fours in her 52. Meanwhile, Ellyse Perry showcased elegance with two striking sixes during a brief 28-run performance. Australia's defense tightened, conceding only one single from the last over. However, the Windies initially started slowly in their chase, managing just three runs in the first two overs. Momentum shifted with Matthews and captain Stafanie Taylor hitting 16 from the fifth over, bowled by Perry, reaching their century stand by the 14th over. Matthews departed with 29 runs needed from 26 balls, and Taylor's innings of 59 concluded leaving only five runs to get from eight deliveries. The final over required three runs, which were secured following an overthrow that led to exuberant West Indian celebrations. The men's team joined the festivities as they arrived for their own final against England. This victory marked a significant revival for West Indies cricket, following their Under-19 team's triumph over India in the 50-over World Cup in February. West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor expressed her long-awaited joy, remarking, \"I've been waiting for this for a long time, and it has come at the perfect moment.

Clustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google\u2019s \u201ccaptain of moonshots\u201d, Astro Teller, told reporters. \"We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,\u201d he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously. \u201cReal users\u201d will be able to use the system in the \u201ccoming months\u201d, he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place. Rural ambition Google\u2019s aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas. Rather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons. The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction. By using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time. Last last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months. Spin off Over the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas. Last month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work. Mr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more \u201cmature\u201d moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in \u201cno rush\u201d to make Project Loon a stand-alone business. \u201cThe service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,\u201d he said. \"Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go.

As Mats Hummels told BBC Scotland afterwards, this was not Germany back to their all-conquering best, but at times against a very good Poland side, they came very close. This was particularly true of the offensive aspect of their play. They swarmed forward, time after time, their incisive passing opening up gaps in the Poland defence. After 20 minutes in the Commerzbank Arena, they had battered the Poles seemingly into submission and the 2-0 scoreline at that point looked like it might become five or six by the end. Thomas Muller, scorer of the first goal, was one of several Germany players on song in that opening period, his languid style belying a sharpness and intelligence that more often than not leads him to be in the right place at the right time in the opposition's box. In Karim Bellarabi, the Bayer Leverkusen winger, Germany appear to have added yet another attacking weapon to their already considerable arsenal. Given his international debut in the defeat by Poland last year, he has become a regular in Joachim Low's line-up and on Friday night showed why. Linking on the left with another relative newcomer - the Cologne full-back Jonas Hector - he gave Lukasz Piszczek, the experienced Borussia Dortmund defender, the run-around, creating Muller's goal and causing havoc. Alan Hutton, or whoever is given the nod by Gordon Strachan at right back, will require support from players in front of and beside him if Germany are not to run amok. Much has been made of the lack of playing time some of Scotland's starters against Georgia had under their belts for their clubs. In the German ranks, a similar issue seemed not to affect Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Gotze. The midfielder has started just two of Manchester United's six competitive matches this season, with Gotze starting just once in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich. Yet both men played significant roles in overcoming Poland. Gotze - nominally playing as a striker - drifted to find space, allowing Muller to fill the gaps left behind. He scored twice - the first a finish from the edge of the box after dancing past Polish defenders on the left of the penalty area - and also struck the post as he sought to reward Low's loyalty in the face of Pep Guardiola's continuing quandary about how best to accommodate him at Bayern.", "text_ai_base": "Germany's uninspiring performance in Tbilisi was concerning, but the match in Frankfurt following their 1-0 victory over Georgia compounded worries about Monday\u2019s potential outcome.

This was especially evident in their attacking play. Germany relentlessly pressed forward, their sharp passes exposing weaknesses in Poland's defense.

Despite his national debut during a loss to Poland last year, he has since become a regular in Joachim Low's lineup, proving his worth on Friday night. Teaming up on the left with another new addition, Cologne full-back Jonas Hector, Bellarabi outmaneuvered Lukasz Piszczek, the seasoned Borussia Dortmund defender, contributing to Muller\u2019s goal and creating chaos in the process.

They were particularly strong in attack, pushing forward at every opportunity and exploiting holes in Poland's defense with quick, incisive passes. By the 20-minute mark at the Commerzbank Arena, it looked like Germany had Poland on the ropes, with a 2-0 advantage that could\u2019ve easily ballooned to five or six goals before the match wrapped up. Thomas Muller, who kicked things off by netting the first goal, was in top form. His seemingly casual style conceals a sharp instinct that puts him in the perfect spots in the penalty box.

Far-right parties failed to pass a 5% barrier to enter parliament, although if they had banded together, and not split their vote, they would have probably slipped past the threshold. Only one government minister has links to nationalist parties - though he is in no way a neo-Nazi or fascist. And the speaker of parliament, Volodymyr Groysman, is Jewish. He has the third most powerful position in the country after the president and prime minister. But Ukrainian officials and many in the media err to the other extreme. They claim that Ukrainian politics are completely fascist-free. This, too, is plain wrong. As a result, the question of the presence of the far-right in Ukraine remains a highly sensitive issue, one which top officials and the media shy away from. No-one wants to provide fuel to the Russian propaganda machine. But this blanket denial also has its dangers, since it allows the ultra-nationalists to fly under the radar. Many Ukrainians are unaware that they exist, or even what a neo-Nazi or fascist actually is, or what they stand for. This hyper-sensitivity and stonewalling were on full display after President Petro Poroshenko presented a Ukrainian passport to someone who, according to human rights activists, is a \"Belarusian neo-Nazi\". The Ukrainian leader handed out medals on 5 December to fighters who had tenaciously defended the main airport in the eastern region of Donetsk from being taken over by Russian-backed separatists. Among the recipients was Serhiy Korotkykh, a Belarusian national, to whom Mr Poroshenko awarded Ukrainian citizenship, praising his \"courageous and selfless service\". The president's website showed a photo of Mr Poroshenko patting the shoulder of the Belarusian, who was clad in military fatigues. Experts who follow the far right have strongly objected to President Poroshenko's decision. They say Mr Korotkykh was a member of the far-right Russian National Unity party and also a founding member of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS) in Russia. According to Ukrainian academic Anton Shekhovtsov, the NSS's main goal \"is to prepare for a race war\". Mr Shekhovtsov said the Belarusian had been charged for involvement in a bombing in central Moscow in 2007, and was detained in 2013 in the Belarusian capital Minsk for allegedly stabbing an anti-fascist activist. He was later released for lack of evidence. Even though the details involved accusations rather than facts, if true they were damning, said human rights activist Halya Coynash. Top Ukrainian officials then rejected as defamatory any claims that Mr Korotkykh had neo-Nazi ties. \"Counter-intelligence has no information that could prevent him from receiving Ukrainian citizenship,\" said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security services.", "text_ai_base": "The claim that Ukraine is free of far-right influence is clearly incorrect.

Consequently, the issue of far-right presence in Ukraine remains sensitive, with officials and media avoiding the topic to prevent giving Russian propaganda any leverage. However, ignoring the problem can be risky, as it allows ultra-nationalists to operate unnoticed and leaves many Ukrainians unaware of what neo-Nazis or fascists believe. This sensitivity was evident when President Petro Poroshenko granted Ukrainian citizenship to an individual accused of being a \"Belarusian neo-Nazi\" by human rights activists. On December 5th, Poroshenko awarded medals to those who defended the Donetsk airport from Russian-backed forces, including Serhiy Korotkykh, whom he praised for his \"courageous and selfless service.\" A photo showed Poroshenko with Korotkykh, dressed in military attire. Experts on the far right criticized Poroshenko's decision, noting Korotkykh's involvement with far-right groups like the Russian National Unity party and the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS), which aims to incite a race war, according to academic Anton Shekhovtsov. Though Korotkykh faced charges for a 2007 Moscow bombing and a 2013 stabbing in Minsk, he was released due to insufficient evidence, though activist Halya Coynash argued the accusations, if true, were grave.

So what can we expect in the months, and possibly years, to come? Crystal-ball gazing can be a dangerous affair, particularly as this is uncharted territory. Previous outbreaks have been rapidly contained, affecting just dozens of people; this one has already infected more than 3,900. But the first clues are in the current data. Dr Christopher Dye, the director of strategy in the office of the director general at the World Health Organization, has the difficult challenge of predicting what will happen next.

However, the two other countries primarily hit by the outbreak, Sierra Leone and Guinea, had been relatively stable. Numbers of new cases were not falling, but they were not soaring either. That is no longer true, with a surge in cases everywhere except some parts of rural Sierra Leone in the districts of Kenema and Kailahun. \"In most other areas, cases and deaths appear to be rising. That came as a shock to me,\" said Dr Dye. The stories of healthcare workers being stretched beyond breaking point are countless. A lack of basic protective gear such as gloves has been widely reported. The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has an isolation facility with 160 beds in Monrovia. But it says the queues are growing and they need another 800 beds to deal with the number of people who are already sick. This is not a scenario for containing an epidemic, but fuelling one. Dr Dye's tentative forecasts are grim: \"At the moment we're seeing about 500 new cases each week. Those numbers appear to be increasing. \"I've just projected about five weeks into the future and if current trends persist we would be seeing not hundreds of cases per week, but thousands of cases per week and that is terribly disturbing. \"The situation is bad and we have to prepare for it getting worse.\" The World Health Organization is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response.", "text_ai_base": "Healthcare workers are visibly overwhelmed, and the response to the outbreak has been criticized as \"lethally inadequate.\" The situation is showing signs of considerable worsening.

Past outbreaks were quickly contained, impacting only a few dozen individuals; however, this outbreak has already affected over 3,900 people. The first insights come from current data. Dr. Christopher Dye, the director of strategy at the World Health Organization, faces the daunting task of forecasting the outbreak's trajectory. He told the BBC, \"We're quite worried about the latest data we've just gathered.\" Until recently, Liberia, particularly near the outbreak's epicenter in Lofa County and its capital Monrovia, was most severely impacted. Meanwhile, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the other two primary affected countries, had been relatively stable, with new case numbers not declining but not surging either. That's changed now, with a rise in cases everywhere except parts of rural Sierra Leone in Kenema and Kailahun districts. \"In most other areas, cases and deaths seem to be increasing.

Dr. Christopher Dye, who's in charge of strategy at the World Health Organization, has the tough job of trying to predict how the outbreak will unfold. He shared with the BBC, \"We're really worried about the latest numbers we've gathered.\" Up until now, Liberia was bearing the brunt, especially around the epicenter in Lofa County and the capital, Monrovia.

But, following the global economic downturn in 2008, and increasingly volatile commodity prices, the country's reliance on diamonds has come into question. For the first time Botswana finds itself cash strapped, in negative growth, and having to go to international donors. The country is looking to diversify its economy by strengthening existing sectors like tourism and cattle farming, and investing in burgeoning industries spawning from technology and entrepreneurship. Yet diamonds by far outshine any other industry in Botswana, accounting for one-third of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues. However, production has peaked, and experts believe reserves of the precious stone may run out by 2030. Unemployment is also on the rise, with official jobless rates nearing 20%, and an estimated 45% of Botswana's population living below the poverty line. Economic growth was also negative in 2009, and the industrial sector shrank by 30%. Signs of labour unrest have also began showing following public sector strikes in recent years. As Linah Mohohlo, who has been governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, put it in a recent interview with BBC Africa Business Report: \"It is a serious concern to government, for many years now strategies have been put in place to diversify the economy away from mining.\" In many ways Botswana is seen as becoming a victim of its own making. Policies have favoured and protected the diamond industry, and strategies and institutions that assisted and protected its growth for decades have made implementation and expansion of newer, alternative industries difficult. The strong role of the state in the economy, plus bloated bureaucracy, often also makes it difficult for investors to enter the market. Most contracts are also government sponsored, making it hard for entrepreneurs to set up shop and compete. Despite being in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa, and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe makes it a bit of a rough neighbourhood. In response Ms Mohohlo says she's more worried about competition from the country's neighbours, especially for foreign direct investment, and says Botswana needs to \"sharpen its pencils\". The manufacturing industry, for example, has \"not done what we expected it to do\", she says. The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining. In addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge.", "text_ai_base": "Widely regarded as the least corrupt country on the continent, Botswana boasts the longest-standing multiparty democracy and one of the world's fastest-growing economies.

In response, the nation is aiming to diversify its economy by bolstering existing sectors such as tourism and cattle farming, while investing in emerging industries driven by technology and entrepreneurship. Despite these efforts, diamonds remain the dominant industry, contributing one-third to the GDP, 70% to export earnings, and one-third to government revenue.

Unemployment is rising, with official rates nearing 20%, and about 45% of the population living below the poverty line. In 2009, economic growth was negative, and the industrial sector contracted by 30%. Signs of labor unrest have appeared following recent public sector strikes. Linah Mohohlo, who has served as governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, expressed concerns in a BBC Africa Business Report interview, noting that the government has long been focused on diversifying the economy away from mining. Botswana is seen as partly a victim of its own policies, which have prioritized and protected the diamond industry, making it challenging to develop and expand newer, alternative industries. State involvement in the economy and bureaucratic hurdles also deter investors from entering the market, as most contracts are government-sponsored, limiting entrepreneurial ventures. Although situated in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe create challenges. Mohohlo is particularly concerned about competition with neighboring countries for foreign direct investment, urging Botswana to improve its competitiveness. The manufacturing sector, for instance, has not met expectations, contributing only about 5% to GDP, despite employing more workers than the mining industry.

For the first time, Botswana's facing financial squeezes, negative growth, and is even knocking on the doors of international donors for a hand. To counteract these issues, Botswana is trying to shake things up economically.

State intervention and red tape scare off investors since most of the contracts are government-backed\u2014putting a damper on entrepreneurial spirits. While Botswana sits in a relatively stable part of southern Africa, it's not without its hurdles. The electricity woes in South Africa and Zimbabwe's political turmoil add to the mix. Mohohlo is especially worried about their neighbors luring away foreign direct investment and thinks Botswana needs to up its game to stay competitive. Manufacturing hasn\u2019t taken off as they'd hoped, only contributing around 5% to the GDP, though it does employ more people than mining.

Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two? The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to \"taking an egg out of omelette\"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \"wanted to serve\" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a \"third way\" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage.

Officials at the Bank generally believed Carney had two choices: either remain until 2021 or leave as initially planned in 2018. However, Carney introduced a third option: extending his term, but only by one year. This decision seemed like an awkward compromise. Was Mr. Carney feeling political pressure to avoid extending until 2021, or was he discouraged by the bleak economic forecasts for the UK post-Brexit, prompting a desire to leave? Another possible factor was how his family, particularly reluctant about another three years in the UK with him often traveling for global summits, felt about the situation. This seemed to be the deciding factor. When he took office in 2013, it was almost unimaginable that the UK would soon be negotiating its exit from the EU, a process Pascal Lamy, the former WTO head, compared to \"taking an egg out of an omelette.\" That changed on June 23, complicating matters for Carney. Leaving in 2018 would mean departing in the midst of Brexit negotiations. Should he then extend his term to the typical eight-year period expected of governors to reassure nervous markets? Carney recognized the job's evolving challenges, even telling confidants he \"wanted to serve\" longer, which led to media predictions that he'd fulfill the eight-year term.

It seemed like a bit of a clunky middle ground. Was political pressure keeping him from staying until 2021? Or maybe he saw the gloomy UK economic forecasts post-Brexit and thought it was a good time to leave? On top of that, his family wasn\u2019t keen on hanging on in the UK for three more years while he was jetting off to global summits. That family factor could've tipped the scales.

In each of the assembly's five regions, UKIP's candidates will be ranked in a ballot of party members. Mr Gill says he fought for that ballot inside the party's National Executive Committee (NEC). Some were worried about candidates imposed on them from outside Wales - candidates like former Tory MPs Mark Reckless and Neil Hamilton. Mr Gill won't be drawn on individuals. It's up to members to decide, he says. But some say Mr Gill didn't do enough - that the entire selection process should have been handled in Wales and that Mr Gill should stand down \"I've worked in Wales for UKIP for 11 years.

Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson reported the article to the police for its \"racial slur.\" In conversation with BBC Sport, Anderson condemned the piece for reinforcing racial stereotypes about Liverpool and highlighted its racist undertones due to Barkley's mixed-race background. Anderson stated on Twitter that he had spoken to Merseyside Police and informed the Independent Press Standards Organisation about the article. In another tweet, he argued that \"ignorance is no excuse\" and claimed the apology was \"simply inadequate.\" He also criticized Everton's lack of response, urging them to ban Sun journalists from Goodison Park, which he called \"a slap in the face to our city.\" He encouraged fans at Saturday's Premier League game against Burnley to turn their backs on the pitch at 15:06 BST in protest. MacKenzie was the editor of the Sun during its infamous 'Hillsborough: The Truth' front-page article, suggesting Liverpool fans were accountable for the 1989 tragedy at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, where 96 people died. MacKenzie apologized for this in 2012, and last year's Hillsborough inquests confirmed the 96 fans were unlawfully killed, exonerating Liverpool supporters in causing the disaster. This Saturday, 15 April, marks 28 years since the tragedy.

The Sun, trying to smooth things over, apologized for the offense caused, saying they weren\u2019t aware of Barkley's background. MacKenzie echoed this, dismissing the racism accusations as \"beyond parody.\" Initially, the article even featured photos of Barkley next to a gorilla, a move that didn\u2019t sit well with anyone, prompting a quick removal. At 23, Barkley recently faced an \"unprovoked attack\" in a Liverpool bar, per his lawyer, which has also spurred a police investigation into that incident. Joe Anderson, the Liverpool Mayor, wasn\u2019t having any of MacKenzie's remarks. He took the issue to the police, calling the piece a \"racial slur,\" chatting with BBC Sport, and pointing out that it perpetuates nasty racial stereotypes, especially given Barkley's mixed-race identity. Anderson hit up Twitter to explain that he contacted Merseyside Police and the Independent Press Standards Organisation about the article, insisting that \"ignorance is no excuse\" and labeling the Sun's apology \"simply inadequate.\" Anderson also took a jab at Everton for staying quiet on the matter, urging them to block Sun journalists from Goodison Park\u2014saying their silence was \"a slap in the face to our city.\" As a call to arms, he asked fans at the weekend's Premier League match against Burnley to turn their backs on the game at 15:06 BST in protest. MacKenzie, it's worth noting, was at the helm of the Sun during its notorious 'Hillsborough: The Truth' front-page debacle, which wrongfully accused Liverpool fans of causing the 1989 tragedy at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium that claimed 96 lives. Though MacKenzie apologized in 2012, the Hillsborough inquests last year confirmed those fans were unlawfully killed and not at fault. This Saturday marks 28 years since that tragic event unfolded. Joey Barton, a former Everton player now at Burnley, didn\u2019t hold back on social media, calling MacKenzie's words about Barkley, \"a young working-class lad,\" downright appalling, emphasizing how out of line they were, given his mixed-race heritage.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

He became a fixture in new Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier's starting line-up this season, repaying the Frenchman with four goals. Now, days before vying to win his third Scotland cap after being included in Gordon Strachan's squad for Sunday's opening World Cup qualifier in Malta, Burke has switched to the German Bundesliga after RB Leipzig paid the English Championship club \u00a313m for his services. Here's five things you should know about the teenager tipped to be the football superstar for which Scotland has long been yearning. Born in Kirkcaldy on 7 April 1997, Burke was brought up in England and joined Nottingham Forest's youth academy at the age of eight. He signed a professional contract shortly before being handed his first-team debut by Stuart Pearce as a late substitute in a 3-1 Capital One Cup defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 24 September 2014. A one-month loan to Bradford City was to follow and two outings in English League One defeats contributed to an inauspicious start to his career. However, on his return to Forest, he gradually established himself as a fixture in the Championship club's first-team squad under fellow Scot Dougie Freedman last season. With his bulging thighs and broad shoulders holding up a 6ft 2in frame, Burke would not look out of place among the bulked-up wingers who these days grace the fields of top-class rugby union. And, by the time he scored his first Forest goal in December's 1-1 draw for Cardiff City, he had elbowed compatriot and namesake Chris Burke out of the picture at the City Ground. Burke the elder, the former Rangers, Cardiff City, Birmingham City and Scotland winger now on trial at Kilmarnock, was subsequently taking his more diminutive frame to Championship rivals Rotherham United on loan before being released at the end of the season. Burke had still featured more from the Forest bench - 18 out of 31 appearances - than the starting line-up, but that did not deter Strachan from calling him into the Scotland squad for the first time in March. Strachan has suggested it was a happy coincidence that Burke had impressed for Forest while the head coach was on a scouting mission to watch striker Tony Watt in action for Charlton Athletic.

By December, when he netted his first Forest goal in a 1-1 draw against Cardiff City, he had overtaken his compatriot Chris Burke at the City Ground.

Subsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge. But despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years. He was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level. He also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda. Not surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill. The keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.", "text_ai_base": "In a rare interview, General Petraeus discussed the challenges of handling \"industrial-strength\" extremists and emphasized that relying solely on military force is insufficient. Known for his role in the Iraq war, he developed the \"surge\" strategy that increased US troop numbers and gained support from Sunni tribesmen against al-Qaeda. Now, Iraq's US-backed army is fighting to reclaim territory taken by IS. Petraeus calls IS \"a formidable enemy,\" describing it as a conventional army with elements of insurgency and significant terrorist components. Petraeus compared IS to al-Qaeda in Iraq, a group he was key in defeating, noting al-Qaeda had deeper roots and larger numbers in Iraq than IS. He referred to IS's recent capture of Ramadi, Anbar province\u2019s capital, as \"a strategic loss,\" undermining the narrative of IS being on the defensive. However, he believes Ramadi will be regained in weeks or less. He stated that this setback calls for strategic reassessment and enhancements, which are already underway. Career highlights: - 1974: Graduated from West Point, joined the army - 2007: Led US troop surge during Iraq war - 2008: Head of US Central Command - 2010: NATO commander in Afghanistan - Mid-2011: Left military to become CIA director - November 2012: Resigned over an affair After commanding international forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, Petraeus led the CIA, stepping down in 2012 due to revelations of an extramarital affair. Allegations he provided classified information to his mistress resulted in a guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge. Despite these personal setbacks, Petraeus remains a notable figure in America\u2019s recent military operations. He masterminded the \"surge,\" shifting US troops from compounds to local areas to improve security. He also expanded the Anbar Awakening, mobilizing Sunni tribesmen against al-Qaeda. In the face of recent challenges in Iraq, the White House, the Pentagon, and Capitol Hill are seeking his insights.

Petraeus doesn't mince words, calling IS \"a formidable enemy\"\u2014a force that acts like a full-fledged army but still holds a mix of insurgents and terrorists. Drawing a comparison to al-Qaeda in Iraq, which he played a pivotal role in defeating, Petraeus pointed out al-Qaeda's deeper entrenchment and bigger numbers in Iraq back then than IS has now. He described IS\u2019s recent capture of Ramadi, the main city in Anbar province, as \"a strategic loss\" that challenges the idea that IS is on the back foot. Despite this, he\u2019s confident Ramadi will be back under control in weeks, maybe even less. Petraeus mentioned this setback calls for a strategic rethink and improvements, which are already in progress. A quick run through his career highlights: he graduated from West Point in 1974 and joined the army; he led the US troop surge during the Iraq war in 2007; took charge of US Central Command in 2008; became NATO commander in Afghanistan in 2010; jumped ship to the CIA in mid-2011; and resigned in November 2012 due to an affair. After leading forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, Petraeus moved on to head the CIA, stepping down in 2012 after it came out he had an extramarital affair.

The Welsh Government said it was aware and considering the case for specific assistance. The British Hydropower Association accused ministers of \"sitting on their hands\" while Community Energy Wales said it was \"ripping the guts\" out of projects. Community energy schemes are often small enterprises run by volunteers, designed to generate income for their area. But the way business rates are calculated means hydro schemes are hit hard: Business rates in England and Wales are calculated by an independent body - the Valuation Office Agency - but the Welsh Government is in charge of how they are raised here. The British Hydropower Association has written to Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford to ask for support. Chief executive Simon Hamlyn said: \"Community hydro schemes are suffering and those businesses will say we can't afford to pay these rates and they'll abandon these schemes and that's the last thing we want.\" Keith Jones, director of Community Energy Wales, said the average increase was 300%. \"No-one could foresee this coming, we didn't even put it down as a risk in our business plans that such a blunt instrument would be used to get more money out of us.\" Mr Jones said the Scottish government had extended a 100% business rates relief for community energy schemes while in England they were capping the increase at \u00a3600.

However, the British Hydropower Association has criticized ministers for inaction, and Community Energy Wales remarked that these changes are severely damaging projects.

They quickly discovered they shared the same frustrations over inadequate support. Though Katharina had a smoother experience when her daughter Amelie was born, specialist help was still elusive. \"Honestly, it\u2019s frustrating,\" she confessed, \"because without someone showing you, you'll struggle to find the services.\" To tackle this, they hosted a coffee morning for parents to connect and share their journeys.

But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered \"almost jokingly\" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: \"According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. \"This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. \" At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. \"That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes,\" Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours.

Unfortunately, the postponement came right before he was supposed to hit the stage, leaving some fans already en route to London. One fan posted on Facebook: \"Sorry to hear that... but we are on a train heading to see him. #gutted... no idea what to do now \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00a2.\" Another said after Wednesday\u2019s show: \"Amazing night last night!!! What a fantastic fan base you have. Get well very soon xxxxxxxx.\" Collins\u2019 team updated on Facebook that he hit his head on a chair during the fall, but assured everyone he's \"recovering well.\" He shared his \"sincere apologies and thanks to fans,\" noting that although he\u2019s dealing with \"drop foot,\" he\u2019s had a \"fantastic week at his first shows in 10 years.\" He really appreciates the warm welcome and can't wait to get back on stage. If you\u2019ve got tickets for the June 8 gig, they\u2019ll be good on November 26, and June 9 tickets are valid for November 27. Next up for Collins is a stop in Cologne this Sunday, then Paris, before leading BST Hyde Park in London on June 30. Phil, famous from Genesis, is a powerhouse songwriter and performer. He\u2019s one of only three artists\u2014alongside Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson\u2014to sell over 100 million albums worldwide as both a solo act and band member. His big hits include \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" and \"Against All Odds.\" On top of that, he\u2019s snagged seven Grammys, six Brits, an Oscar, and two Golden Globes.

Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. \"Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation,\" he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs.

In a press conference hours later, National Security Adviser HR McMaster said Mr Trump's revelations where \"wholly appropriate\". This was always going to be the most effective response, as the president has broad powers to declassify whatever he deems necessary. As the old Richard Nixon line goes: \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal\". The president's explanation is not absolution, however. A wave of the hand on Twitter isn't going to make this story go away any time soon. Here are five reasons why. Let's get the impeachment question out of the way first. Shortly after the Washington Post story detailing the allegations broke, there were cries of \"treason\" from Mr Trump's more vociferous critics and calls for immediate removal from office. The charge that Mr Trump, through ignorance or boastfulness, casually disclosed highly classified intelligence for no reason may not be a criminal offence, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't create a political controversy that could, in a worst-case scenario for the president, end in his impeachment. The process for impeachment for \"high crimes and misdemeanours\" as outlined in the US constitution is a political act. A simple majority of the House of Representatives can impeach, initiating a trial in the Senate and a two-thirds vote necessarily for removal. As the writers of Lawfare Blog point out, Mr Trump's opponents could accuse him of violations of his oath of office to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the US Constitution - a catch-all category cited in the three previous times a president has been seriously threatened with impeachment. Just because it's possible, however, doesn't mean it's likely. And again, it has nothing to do with the law and everything to do with politics - and how the story plays out from here. Like Indiana Jones looking at a chamber full of snakes, many in the Trump White House must be muttering to themselves: \"Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?\" Allegations of cosier-than-desired relations with the US geopolitical adversary have bedevilled Mr Trump since the early days of his presidential campaign. He's been questioned about the praise he's lavished on President Vladimir Putin, some of his aides are caught up in the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the US 2016 election, his attorney general was forced to recuse himself because of an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and his first national security adviser was fired for obfuscating about his Russia ties (and is one of the people under FBI investigation to boot).", "text_ai_base": "In a series of Tuesday morning tweets, the president described any release of intelligence information as a strategic effort to further U.S. national security priorities. Later that day, National Security Adviser HR McMaster defended Mr. Trump's actions as \"wholly appropriate\" during a press conference. This was indeed the most effective response, given the president's broad authority to declassify information at his discretion. As the old Richard Nixon quote suggests, \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\" However, the president\u2019s justification doesn\u2019t make the issue disappear, and a Twitter statement alone won\u2019t quell the controversy. Here are five reasons why. Let\u2019s address the impeachment topic first. After the Washington Post reported the allegations, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest critics accused him of \"treason\" and demanded his immediate removal from office. Although casually disclosing highly classified intelligence due to ignorance or boastfulness might not be a criminal offense, it could spark a political scandal that, worst-case scenario for the president, could lead to impeachment. The process, defined in the U.S. Constitution as for \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" is inherently political. A simple House majority can impeach, which sets off a Senate trial requiring a two-thirds vote for removal. As highlighted by the writers of Lawfare Blog, Mr. Trump\u2019s critics could accuse him of violating his oath to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the U.S. Constitution\u2014an inclusive category invoked in the three prior serious presidential impeachment efforts. Though possible, it isn\u2019t inevitable, as it hinges on politics, not law\u2014and on how the story progresses. Some in the Trump White House might be echoing Indiana Jones\u2019 famous lament: \"Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?\" Claims of overly close ties with America's geopolitical rival have dogged Mr. Trump since his presidential campaign began. He has faced scrutiny over his praise for President Vladimir Putin, some aides are involved in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, his attorney general recused himself over an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and his first national security adviser was dismissed for misleading about his Russian connections (and is now under FBI investigation).", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "In a string of tweets on Tuesday morning, the president framed the release of intelligence information as a cunning move to boost U.S. national security priorities.

It was probably the smartest approach, given the president's broad powers to declassify info whenever he sees fit. As Richard Nixon famously said, \u201cWhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d But saying it's justified doesn't make the problem vanish, and a tweet isn't going to put out the fire. Let\u2019s dive into why that is. First up, the whole impeachment talk. Following a report by The Washington Post, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest critics pounced, accusing him of \"treason\" and calling for his swift removal. While carelessly revealing top-secret intel out of sheer ignorance or bragging might not be illegal, it could ignite a political storm that, worst-case scenario for the president, could lead to impeachment proceedings. This process in the U.S. Constitution is about \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d making it more about politics than strict law. In the House, a simple majority is enough to impeach, kicking off a Senate trial that demands a two-thirds vote to actually remove a president. As the folks at Lawfare Blog point out, critics might argue Mr. Trump\u2019s actions breached his oath to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the Constitution\u2014a broad argument raised in the three serious presidential impeachment attempts in U.S. history. While it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s certainly not a given, especially since the outcome depends heavily on political dynamics and how the narrative unfolds. Meanwhile, some in Trump's circle might feel like grumbling, \"Russians. Why'd it have to be the Russians?\" Allegations of cozying up to America\u2019s geopolitical adversary have shadowed Mr. Trump since he hit the campaign trail. He\u2019s been under the microscope for his compliments to President Vladimir Putin; several aides remain entangled in investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election; his attorney general stepped back from his role due to a nondisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak; and his first national security adviser was shown the door for fibbing about his Russian ties\u2014and now faces an FBI probe.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

Labour has accused the government of \"dodging difficult questions\" about who will lose funding in the changes. Mrs Morgan says schools need funding that \"genuinely matches their need\". She says the plans will ensure money goes \"straight to the frontline\", but it will mark a further reduction in the link between local authorities and schools. On Monday the education secretary has taken the next step towards introducing a new school funding formula in 2017-18, after complaints about local anomalies and spending gaps. For example, pupils in Rotherham each receive \u00a3500 per year more in funding than those in Plymouth, even though they have similar levels of disadvantage. In December, MPs led by former Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart presented a petition calling for change, saying the best-funded areas received up to \u00a36,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded received \u00a34,200. The government has a manifesto pledge to create a more consistent way to distribute more than \u00a340bn per year of the core schools budget - and says it wants to end funding rates based on \"oddities of history\". Further details were announced in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, with the promise of a national rate for each pupil, with extra funding for those with additional needs. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, backed the principle of a fairer redistribution of funding.

Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of a change to funding arrangements. \"However simply redistributing the current pot of money is not enough on its own to address the significant real-terms cuts currently hitting school budgets.

Here is a selection of your experiences and opinions about the idea. How can we say we want equality over pay and employment and then ask for a day's extra 'holiday' per month just for being a female? That's not asking for equality, that's saying women aren't as able to work as men, which surely kills all argument for equality... Guess what, I'm a female who has a period every month and I am still able to work as well as any man! If some women can't then that's their problem and they need to see a doctor! Charlotte Rachael, Halifax, UK Personally, I suffer, for up to two weeks straight, I suffer. I've passed out through temporary anaemia at work. I've had to stop walking and hold on to a wall or a fence when walking to work. But I don't consider it necessary to call in sick, nor do I believe additional leave days should be required... We don't need additional leave, those who are suffering so badly need to push with their GPs to see a specialist.

Valerie Richardson, Oregon, US The idea [of menstrual leave] makes sense to a degree, but surely unpaid leave will increase the wage gap (fewer hours means lower wages), which many people seem to take issue with. If it were to be paid leave, people who take the leave will either have to work harder to make up the time, or an earnings gap will develop, which is a much bigger problem than a wage gap, since fewer hours worked and equal wages means more money per hour worked for the same job, which is normally illegal. Obviously time off because of pain isn't a holiday, but it's simply not providing value to the company. I guess another alternative would be government subsidy, but I'm generally against too much of that in principle. Alex, Dundee, UK I do sympathise with women who have a genuine problem.

Valerie Richardson, Oregon, US The concept of menstrual leave seems sensible to an extent, but unpaid leave could widen the wage gap since fewer hours result in lower wages, which is a concern for many. If it were paid, those taking leave would need to work harder to compensate, or an earnings gap would emerge\u2014a more significant issue than the wage gap, as fewer hours and equal pay lead to higher pay per hour, typically unlawful.

But let's start with to bulk up and get on in rugby, and leave the Heineken Cup for another day. The public statement made by Sam Chalmers, son of one of our finest ever players Craig, is that he is sorry and that he got the stuff off the internet. It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it? Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand Here is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now. What I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you. Some players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more. Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards. Perhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice. So is it possible to get big enough taking food alone? The IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby.", "text_ai_base": "Determining which event shocked us more\u2014the first positive steroids test in Scottish rugby history or the criticism of Scottish, Welsh, and Irish teams qualifying for the Heineken Cup from a non-relegation league\u2014is challenging. However, let's focus on the steroids issue and leave the Heineken Cup discussion for another time. Sam Chalmers, son of one of our esteemed players, Craig Chalmers, publicly apologized, claiming he bought the steroids online. This explanation resembles the \"lone wolf\" narrative. Was Sam truly the only one using them? Did he discuss it with others? Coaches in youth rugby have mentioned that weight training and supplement use are closely linked. It's understandable that players feel pressured to grow bigger and heavier\u2014while the rugby field size hasn't changed in 150 years, people have. Modern rugby often involves more brute force than agility. What I don't accept is the notion that players feel pressured to use steroids. This is cheating. Purchasing steroids is knowingly breaking the rules and hoping to evade detection by drug testers. Some players might have considered steroids but decided against it. If you're not naturally large enough, perhaps rugby isn't the right path for you. It\u2019s no longer a sport for all body types. Young players are often with supplements; they use them before, during, and after workouts, perhaps believing they can't achieve their goals with food alone. This mindset might lead to the dangerous conclusion that artificial aids, including steroids, are necessary. So, can one achieve size with just a natural diet?

So, Sam Chalmers\u2014who happens to be the son of the well-regarded player Craig Chalmers\u2014came forward to apologize, saying he got the steroids online. Sounds like he\u2019s painting himself as a \u201clone wolf,\u201d doesn\u2019t it? But was he really alone in using them? Did he confide in anyone? According to some youth rugby coaches, the connection between weight training and supplement use can't be ignored. No doubt, players feel the push to bulk up\u2014while the rugby field has stayed the same size for 150 years, people certainly haven\u2019t. Nowadays, brute force often takes precedence over nimbleness on the field. What I can't accept? The idea that players feel they\u2019ve got no choice but to turn to steroids. That\u2019s flat-out cheating. Buying steroids? It\u2019s about breaking the rules, hoping to slip under the radar of drug testers. Sure, some guys might think about steroids and ultimately decide against it. And hey, if you\u2019re not innately big enough, maybe rugby isn\u2019t your thing. It\u2019s not really a sport for any and every body type anymore. Young players often go heavy on supplements\u2014before, during, and after their training\u2014possibly thinking they can't hit their targets with regular food alone.

What is the secret to the film's success? Although he spent many years in supporting roles and is best known for his comic role in cult US sitcom Parks and Recreation, Pratt has become one of Hollywood's most bankable stars in the past year. He starred in two of 2014's top five grossing films at the US box office - The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. An endearing mixture of charm, vulnerability and humour means he can humanise even the most effects-laden summer blockbusters - something he proved in Marvel's Guardians, where his co-stars were a talking raccoon and a giant animated tree. Against expectations, the film took $774m (\u00a3499m) at the global box office - making it the third highest-grossing film in 2014. The actor didn't exactly get hit with the ugly stick, either. There is a strict quota on the number of foreign films which can be screened in China - currently set at 34 movies a year. But the country's film market is the world's second largest after the US so getting your film on the list can boost box office takings considerably. Most Hollywood blockbusters do not open in China the same time as the US but unusually, Jurassic World opened in both territories the same weekend. The film opened in 66 foreign markets in total, earning $307.2m (\u00a3198m). China accounted for $100.8m (\u00a365m) - almost 20% of its total haul. When Jurassic Park was released Imax screens were scarce, reserved usually for short films, documentaries and theme park novelties. With some 800 Imax screens around the world now, the prospect of seeing dinosaurs even larger than life-size has proved to be a compelling draw. With the added ability to see a T-Rex in 3D, it seems audiences have been happy to pay premium prices for extra spectacle - bumping up box office returns in the process. According to box office analysts Rentrak, nearly 50% of Jurassic World's US box office came from 3D screenings. Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park holds a special place in the memories of many cinema fans. It set a new standard for CGI, and became a touchstone of 1990s cinema, capturing a generation's imagination. \"I was 12 when Jurassic Park came out and it just blew me away,\" Jurassic World actress Dallas Bryce Howard told the BBC. \"I remember watching it and thinking, 'I'm seeing real dinosaurs right now'. It felt so real.\" \"I was 13 years old and I felt the same,\" her co-star Chris Pratt added.", "text_ai_base": "In the US, the film brought in $204.6 million (\u00a3132 million) according to early estimates, making it the second-largest opening weekend ever, just behind 2012's Marvel's The Avengers with $207.4 million (\u00a3133.8 million). What contributed to the film's success? Despite spending years in supporting roles and gaining fame for his comedic performance in the cult US sitcom Parks and Recreation, Chris Pratt has become one of Hollywood's most reliable stars over the past year. He appeared in two of 2014's top five highest-grossing films at the US box office: The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. With a blend of charm, vulnerability, and humor, Pratt manages to bring humanity to even the most special-effects-heavy blockbusters. This talent was evident in Marvel's Guardians, where his co-stars were a talking raccoon and a giant animated tree\u2014yet the film unexpectedly grossed $774 million (\u00a3499 million) worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2014. Pratt\u2019s appearance certainly doesn't detract from his appeal. China, the world\u2019s second-largest film market after the US, restricts foreign film screenings to 34 a year. This makes it crucial for Hollywood blockbusters to secure a spot on that list to significantly boost box office earnings. Unlike most Hollywood films, which don't release in China at the same time as in the US, Jurassic World debuted simultaneously in both regions. It opened in a total of 66 international markets, earning $307.2 million (\u00a3198 million), with China contributing $100.8 million (\u00a365 million)\u2014almost 20% of the global total. When the original Jurassic Park was released, IMAX screens were rare, typically showing short films, documentaries, and theme park features. Now, with about 800 IMAX screens worldwide, the chance to see dinosaurs larger than life is a major draw. The option to watch a T-Rex in 3D has led audiences to pay premium prices for the added spectacle, boosting box office revenues. According to Rentrak, a box office analyst, nearly 50% of Jurassic World's US earnings came from 3D showings. Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park holds a nostalgic place for many moviegoers. It set new standards for CGI and became a defining film of the 1990s, captivating an entire generation. \"I was 12 when Jurassic Park came out, and it blew me away,\" Jurassic World actress Bryce Dallas Howard told the BBC. \"Watching it felt like seeing real dinosaurs.\" Her co-star Chris Pratt added, \"I was 13 and felt the same way.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "In the US, the film raked in an impressive $204.6 million (\u00a3132 million), based on initial estimates.

Well, Chris Pratt seems to be a big factor. After years of playing supporting roles and gaining recognition for his comedic work on Parks and Recreation, Pratt's become one of Hollywood's most bankable stars over the last year. Back in 2014, he starred in two of the top five highest-grossing films at the US box office: The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. Pratt has a knack for mixing charm, vulnerability, and humor, injecting humanity into even the most CGI-heavy blockbusters. This was clear in Guardians, a movie that featured a talking raccoon and a giant animated tree, yet still managed to earn a whopping $774 million (\u00a3499 million) globally. It was the third highest-grossing movie of that year. Pratt's looks certainly don't hurt his appeal either. Let's talk China\u2014Hollywood's second-largest film market after the US, known for its tight restrictions, allowing just 34 foreign films each year. So snagging a spot on that list is crucial for boosting box office numbers. Unlike most Hollywood flicks that hit China later than the US, Jurassic World launched simultaneously in both regions. Released across 66 international markets, it pulled in $307.2 million (\u00a3198 million) worldwide, with a hefty $100.8 million (\u00a365 million) from China alone\u2014that's almost 20% of the global take. Back when the original Jurassic Park came out, IMAX screens were mostly reserved for short films and documentaries. Fast forward to today, and there are about 800 IMAX screens worldwide, giving audiences the chance to see dinosaurs in larger-than-life detail. Watching a T-Rex in 3D has enticed viewers to buy those pricier tickets for a more immersive experience, significantly boosting box office sales. In fact, Rentrak, a box office analysis firm, reports that nearly half of Jurassic World's US earnings came from 3D showings. Finally, Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster, Jurassic Park, holds a special place in the hearts of many. It was a game-changer for CGI and one of the defining films of the '90s, capturing the imaginations of an entire generation.

{"id": "xsum_37617379", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "If you have eaten a handful of spicy chicken wings in Angola recently or perhaps polished off a lemony \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal, there is a good chance your chicken travelled some distance before finding its way on to your plate. It depends where you live in Africa, but chickens are increasingly migrating - in freezers - from Brazil, Germany or other European Union countries to the continent. Imports of chicken to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014, according to figures from the US Department of Agriculture. Here's a look at reasons behind the huge increase and what can be done to help fatten up the continent's poultry industry - in four points: 1) Why chickens not cows? Africa has a growing population, which is projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, and with that has come an increased demand for the consumption of meat, of one variety in particular. \"Chicken is the first choice of meat for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell, chief executive of the South Africa Poultry Association. The higher cost of beef and some of the religious restrictions around pork in parts of Africa help explain the preference for chicken, he says. As more people move to the city, their dietary patterns begin to change and they are more likely to choose meat from a local fast food joint, or one of the global chains that have proliferated across the continent in recent years. The fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken now has more than 700 outlets in Africa, operating in 13 countries. \"The production of meat has not caught up with the demand... driven both by the rise in the population but also by the urbanisation phenomenon,\" explains Calestous Juma, a professor of International Development at Harvard University. And the growth really is phenomenal. By 2030, 50% of Africans, numbering more than half a billion, are expected to be living in cities, up from 36% in 2010, according to World Bank estimates. 2) Hungry birds Many Africans will be familiar with the \"road runner\" chicken, which can often be found in the backyard roaming freely. These birds tend to feed themselves and are known for being tough but tasty. As a means to feed the family or make a small income these low-input birds tend to do the job. However, when it comes to intensive farming, a steady supply of chicken feed which is made up of maize and soya is vital. But weak agricultural systems in Africa mean that feed often has to be imported at a high cost, hampering farmers' efforts to ramp up their grain production.", "text_ai_base": "If you've recently enjoyed a spicy chicken wing in Angola or a tangy \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal, chances are the chicken traveled quite a distance to reach your plate. Depending on your location in Africa, chickens are increasingly being imported\u2014frozen\u2014from Brazil, Germany, or other European Union countries. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, chicken imports to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014. Here are four reasons for this surge and potential strategies to boost the continent's poultry industry: 1) Why Chicken, Not Beef? Africa's population is projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, escalating the demand for meat, particularly chicken. \"Chicken is the preferred meat for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell, CEO of the South Africa Poultry Association. The high cost of beef and religious restrictions on pork in some regions contribute to this preference. As urban populations grow, people are more likely to eat at local fast-food eateries or global chains that have expanded across Africa. For instance, Kentucky Fried Chicken now boasts over 700 outlets in 13 African countries. \"Meat production hasn't kept pace with the surge in demand, driven by both population growth and urbanization,\" explains Calestous Juma, a professor of International Development at Harvard University. This trend is remarkable. By 2030, an estimated 50% of Africans\u2014more than half a billion people\u2014are expected to live in urban areas, up from 36% in 2010, according to World Bank estimates. 2) Feeding the Birds Many Africans know the \"road runner\" chicken, often found freely roaming backyards. These birds, known for being tough yet flavorful, typically fend for themselves and provide sustenance or a small income with minimal input. However, intensive farming requires a steady supply of chicken feed, mostly comprising maize and soy. Africa's weak agricultural systems mean feed often has to be imported at high costs, hindering farmers' ability to scale up grain production.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "So, you've savored a fiery chicken wing in Angola or a zesty \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal recently? Well, that chicken might have quite the travel story, probably coming from places like Brazil, Germany, or other EU countries, frozen for the journey. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that chicken imports to sub-Saharan Africa have skyrocketed\u2014tripled, in fact, between 2004 and 2014. But why's this happening, and what can be done to boost local poultry production? Let's dive into four key reasons behind this trend and some ideas on how to beef up (or rather, \"chicken up\") Africa's poultry industry: 1) So, Why Chicken Over Beef? There's a massive demographic shift coming; Africa's population is on track to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, which means meat demand is going through the roof, with chicken leading the race. \"Chicken reigns supreme for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell from the South Africa Poultry Association. Beef prices can be pretty steep, and pork is off the menu in certain areas due to religious practices. With more folks living in cities, there's a growing appetite for local fast-food joints and global franchises. Kentucky Fried Chicken, for example, is making its mark with over 700 outlets spread across 13 African nations. \"Meat production can't keep up with this insane demand growth,\" explains Calestous Juma, a Harvard professor specializing in International Development. It's eye-opening! The World Bank paints a picture where by 2030, half of Africa's population\u2014over half a billion people\u2014will be city dwellers, up from 36% in 2010. 2) Feeding the Birds: Remember the good ol' \"road runner\" chicken wandering freely in backyards? Known for their toughness and taste, these birds mostly survive by their own wit, offering nutrition or a little extra cash with minimal fuss. But scaling up farming involves feed supplies, mainly maize and soy. Due to weak agricultural systems in Africa, feed sometimes needs importing, raising costs and stalling farmers' plans to increase grain output.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

Ofcom has told the government that the process could be accelerated to launch 4G networks in many places by May or June. It had been thought that it would take until the end of the year. Ahead of the meeting O2 said that it was hopeful that it could launch 4G services in summer 2013. Ronan Dunne, chief executive of O2, said, \"It's been a very good process and it feels that we've made a lot of progress, so I'm hopeful that we'll have a basis for moving forward.\" But he went on to express disappointment that Ofcom had not acted earlier: \"We're pleased that we've made progress but frustrated that it's taken so long\". An Ofcom spokesman responded: \"To suggest that the delay has been caused by anything other than litigation - and the threat of litigation - on behalf of competing companies is inaccurate.\" Previously O2 and Vodafone had expressed anger that rival network EE - formerly known as Everything Everywhere - had been given permission to use its existing 1,800MHz spectrum to launch a 4G service earlier. O2 had threatened legal action to prevent EE gaining this advantage. A deal could pave the way for EE to announce its 4G launch date, which could be before the end of this month. O2 and Vodafone will not be able to offer 4G until other parts of the radio spectrum - including those previously used for analogue television and air traffic control - are freed up and sold off. The UK's fourth biggest network - Three - is set to take over part of EE's 4G spectrum, but is not due to do so until September 2013. Ofcom has said it could bring forward its airwave auction by about a fortnight from its current January date, and then speed up handover of control of the frequencies. That could help shrink EE's period of exclusivity to roughly half a year. However, if the networks decide to pursue a legal challenge the process would be delayed. \"Ofcom made quite a clever move by allowing EE to launch early,\" said Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst with Ovum. \"Because it's now really set the wheels in motion, and will see the others pull their fingers out.\" A source at one major network told the BBC that it was also seeking a guarantee from EE that it would not hinder the operation of Mitco, an organisation that has been set up to deal with the possible interference 4G may have on other signals such as digital television.", "text_ai_base": "Mobile operators, Culture Secretary Maria Miller, and communications regulator Ofcom are set to discuss expediting the allocation of spectrum to enable faster mobile download speeds.

Ronan Dunne, O2's chief executive, remarked, \"It's been a very good process, and it feels like we've made significant progress, so I'm hopeful we'll have a basis for moving forward.\" However, he also voiced frustration over the delays, stating, \"We're pleased with the progress but frustrated by the time it has taken.\" An Ofcom spokesperson clarified that the delays were due to litigation\u2014actual and threatened\u2014by competing companies. Earlier, O2 and Vodafone were upset that rival network EE, formerly Everything Everywhere, was permitted to use its existing 1,800MHz spectrum to launch a 4G service earlier. O2 had even considered legal action to block EE's advantage. A forthcoming deal may allow EE to announce its 4G launch date by the end of this month. O2 and Vodafone can't offer 4G until other radio spectrum parts, previously used for analog TV and air traffic control, are cleared and sold. The UK\u2019s fourth largest network, Three, is set to acquire part of EE\u2019s 4G spectrum but not until September 2013. Ofcom suggested it might advance its airwave auction by about two weeks from its planned January schedule, speeding up the transfer of frequencies, potentially cutting EE's exclusive period to about half a year. However, any legal challenges could delay this process. \"Ofcom made a clever move by letting EE launch early,\" said Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst with Ovum. \"It's really set things in motion and will push others to act.\" A major network source mentioned to the BBC that they also sought a guarantee from EE not to obstruct Mitco, an organization set up to address potential 4G interference with other signals, like digital TV.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "So, here's the scoop: Mobile operators, Culture Secretary Maria Miller, and communications regulator Ofcom are gearing up to chat about speeding up the spectrum allocation to get faster mobile download speeds rolling. Ofcom reckons they can fast-track this process, possibly kicking off 4G networks around May or June, rather than waiting till the end of the year as initially thought. Even before the meeting, O2\u2019s been pretty upbeat about launching their 4G services by summer 2013. O2's chief exec, Ronan Dunne, sounded pretty positive when he said, \"It's been a very good process, and it feels like we've made significant progress, so I'm hopeful we'll have a basis for moving forward.\" Yet, he couldn\u2019t hide his impatience, adding, \"We're pleased with the progress but frustrated by the time it has taken.\" An Ofcom spokesperson cleared the air, blaming litigation\u2014both real and threatened\u2014for the long wait. O2 and Vodafone especially weren't thrilled when the rival network EE, previously known as Everything Everywhere, got the green light to use its existing 1,800MHz spectrum for 4G ahead of the others. O2 even considered hitting the legal route to block EE's edge. Now, there's a possible deal in sight that might see EE announcing its 4G launch date by the month\u2019s end. O2 and Vodafone, on the other hand, have to hang tight until the older radio spectrum bits, which were for analog TV and air traffic control, are cleared and sold. The UK's fourth-largest network, Three, isn\u2019t in the running for EE\u2019s 4G spectrum until September 2013. Ofcom hinted at possibly nudging its airwave auction forward by two weeks from the January schedule, aiming to speed up the frequency transfer and effectively cut EE's head start to around half a year. But if any legal spanners get thrown in the works, delays could crop up. \"Ofcom made a clever move by letting EE launch early,\" commented Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst with Ovum. \"It's really set things in motion and will push others to act.\" Meanwhile, a major network source told the BBC they're seeking assurance from EE not to obstruct Mitco, a group tasked with sorting out potential 4G interference with other signals, like digital TV.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve?

On taking \"All My Sons\" on tour during Arthur Miller's centenary, Buffong notes that this milestone draws extra attention to an exceptional piece of work by an extraordinary writer. Although the tour coincides with the centenary, it was unplanned but fortuitous. What makes \"All My Sons\" an American classic? Its themes are universal, delving into the pursuit of the American dream, and the costs associated with it. The play explores loyalty, trust, betrayal, family secrets, and the collapse of illusions when truths surface. Joe Keller, driven by familial loyalty, believes actions are justified if done for family, ignoring broader social responsibilities\u2014this is his downfall. The 2013 production received five-star reviews; does this add pressure to the current tour? Buffong admits he hasn't dwelled on it, as overthinking might disrupt his sleep. Reviews, both positive and negative, are an inseparable part of theater. How much is being adjusted this time? Revisiting a fantastic play reveals new depths. With half of the cast being new, fresh elements are naturally introduced, showcasing the text's enduring richness. Does a black cast offer a new perspective? It adds nuance, especially when considering a black family striving for the American dream, amplifying the stakes given black history in the US.

Michael Buffong, the director, recently chatted with arts correspondent Tim Masters about why this drama has earned the status of a 20th-century classic. Buffong points out that touring \"All My Sons\" during Arthur Miller\u2019s centenary adds a special layer of attention to an already remarkable work. Although the timing wasn\u2019t planned, it's certainly one of those delightful surprises. So, what makes \"All My Sons\" resonate as an American classic? Well, its themes strike a universal chord, examining the American dream\u2019s allure and its steep costs. The narrative plunges into issues of loyalty, trust, betrayal, family secrets, and what happens when illusions crumble under harsh truths. Joe Keller\u2019s blind spot is obvious\u2014his intense family loyalty leads him to justify actions solely for familial benefit, forgetting about wider societal responsibilities. That's where he trips up. Reflecting on the five-star reviews from the 2013 production, is there a sense of pressure this time around? Buffong confesses he hasn't let it weigh him down\u2014overthinking could keep him up at night. In theater, you're guaranteed to encounter reviews, good or bad. So, what's different for this tour? Tackling a classic anew always uncovers fresh insights. With half the cast being newcomers, there's a natural infusion of fresh energy, showcasing the play\u2019s lasting richness. Does a black cast bring something unique to the table? Certainly\u2014it adds layers, especially when portraying a black family chasing the American dream, raising the stakes given the backdrop of black history in the U.S. Still, at its core, it remains a story about an all-American family.

It's particularly disappointing since the UK government claimed to aim for a negotiating framework encompassing the entire UK.\" Although Mr. Jones may be appealing to his audience, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns responded: \"I'm somewhat disappointed by that reaction. The prime minister has visited Wales three times in the past six weeks. We've discussed the letter's content for months. We've all made our contributions, but ultimately, the UK government must act in the interests of the whole UK, including Wales.\" Mrs. May did mention Wales in the letter to Donald Tusk, stating: \"When powers are returned to the UK, we will fully consult on which should remain in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The government expects this process to significantly increase the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\" While this may have had Scotland in mind, it raises questions: Which powers will be redistributed? Will this include farming or economic aid? And crucially, will funding accompany these powers? Alun Cairns did not answer these, though Carwyn Jones voiced concerns that no additional funding would follow the powers after 2020. This perhaps suggests Mr. Jones doubts Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year, despite Labour's promise to maintain EU funding levels for regional aid post-2020. Some in Whitehall argue that the spending of EU money in Wales, highlighted in Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale, justifies moving powers to Westminster, but this now seems politically unlikely.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Even if the two governments see eye to eye on some matters, like free trade within the single market, Carwyn Jones wasn\u2019t thrilled when he realized he never got a peek at that letter before it went public on Wednesday.

It\u2019s been a pretty infuriating process where devolved administrations have repeatedly been brushed aside. Especially seeing that the UK government claims it wants to negotiate in a way that includes the entire UK.\u201d Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns had his own take, saying, \u201cThat reaction's a bit disappointing. The prime minister\u2019s been to Wales three times just in the last six weeks. We\u2019ve been talking about the letter\u2019s content for ages. Everyone\u2019s chipped in, but the UK government\u2019s gotta think about the whole UK, including Wales.\u201d And while Mrs. May did remember to mention Wales in her note to Donald Tusk, she noted, \"Once powers return to the UK, we\u2019ll consult thoroughly to decide which should stick around in Westminster and which should go to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The government expects this will greatly boost decision-making power for each devolved administration.\" While Scotland might've been the focus, there are some pressing questions: Which powers are getting redistributed? Does this cover farming or economic aid? And, maybe most crucially, will these powers come with funding? Alun Cairns didn\u2019t dive into these, but Carwyn Jones flagged worries that no extra funding would accompany the powers after 2020.

Figures obtained by the BBC show more than 4,000 cases since 2013 where children have taken explicit pictures of themselves and sent them to others. It is illegal to possess, take or distribute sexual images of someone who is under 18, including of yourself. The five-year-old, from County Durham, was spoken to by officers of Durham Constabulary last year. He is the youngest person to be investigated for sexting by police forces in England and Wales who responded to a BBC Newcastle request for information. The force's DCI Steve Thubron said sexting issues were dealt with on a case by case basis, with a focus on safeguarding children. He said incidents were recorded in line with national crime recording standards. \"We deal with incidents proportionately and obviously do not criminalise children,\" he said. \"We have worked with other agencies to provide advice and guidance to both schoolteachers and young people. \"We would urge any children who are worried to speak with a trusted adult or call 101.\" The most common age of those involved in sexting is 13 or 14. A 10-year-old boy - only just at the age of criminal responsibility - has been cautioned by Northumbria Police for sexting. The boy sent a sexual image of himself to an 11-year-old child using Oovoo - a free social media video and image sharing app. Greater Manchester Police recorded the highest number of child sexters with 695 cases looked into - including four seven-year-olds and four eight-year-olds. Even if a child isn't prosecuted for sending, distributing or possessing an indecent image or video, once it has been sent, it is no longer in the sender's control. If the content is then posted on a public social media page, it could be viewed by friends and family, or potential employers. Many children have spoken of instances where an image has been shared with a girlfriend or boyfriend, only for the image to then be circulated more widely. Kerry Smith of Plan International UK, which works for children's rights, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: \"Girls are being pressured - sexting is a gendered issue - more girls are being asked to share. \"There are double standards. When they do (share), the girls are shamed, not the boys who are holding the phones or the pictures or asking for them.\" She said education was key. \"People know there's an issue. They want that knowledge shared with their children and we've got to make sure that's what's happening in our schools,\" she said.", "text_ai_base": "In the past three years, police in England and Wales have spoken to nearly 400 children under the age of 12. According to data obtained by the BBC, there have been over 4,000 incidents since 2013 where children created and shared explicit images of themselves. It is illegal to possess, create, or distribute sexual images of anyone under 18, including oneself. A five-year-old from County Durham was interviewed by Durham Constabulary last year, making him the youngest to be involved in a sexting investigation by police in response to a BBC Newcastle inquiry. DCI Steve Thubron stated that sexting cases are addressed on an individual basis, with an emphasis on protecting children. He assured that incidents are documented according to national crime recording standards and that children are not criminalized in this process. \"We collaborate with other organizations to offer guidance to teachers and young people,\" he said. \"We urge children with concerns to talk to a trusted adult or contact 101.\" The typical ages of those involved in sexting are 13 and 14. Notably, a 10-year-old boy, just at the threshold of criminal responsibility, was cautioned by Northumbria Police after sending a sexual image of himself to an 11-year-old via Oovoo, a social media app for video and image sharing. Greater Manchester Police reported the highest number of child sexting cases, tallying 695, including instances involving four seven-year-olds and four eight-year-olds. Even without prosecution, once an indecent image or video is sent, it's beyond the sender's control. If such content appears on a public social media platform, it may be seen by friends, family, or potential employers. Many children have recounted experiences where an image shared with a partner was then widely distributed. Kerry Smith from Plan International UK, an organization advocating for children's rights, remarked on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show that sexting pressures are gendered. \"Girls face more pressure to share,\" she noted. \"When they do, they are shamed, not the boys who request or possess the images.\" She emphasized the importance of education, highlighting that awareness of the issue exists. \"Parents want this knowledge conveyed to their children, and it's crucial that schools are ensuring this,\" she added.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Over the last three years, police in England and Wales have talked to nearly 400 kids under 12.

This is a direct challenge to China, which still sees the island as a province to be reunified by force if needed. What Beijing will have to decipher is where exactly Ms Tsai stands on the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty and what her next move will be. She has skilfully avoided clarifying this. She is not just a mystery to China. Many Taiwanese see her as a quiet enigmatic force, difficult to predict.

She later pushed for the first-ever chartered flights between the two sides.

A former student thinks the school is overreacting, stressing how significant the prom is as a rite of passage. Headmaster Chris Beirne argues that the prom is distracting from the school\u2019s values. In a letter to parents, he quoted a colleague who was critical of the event, calling the preparations neither positive nor worthwhile. This colleague noted the financial strain and competitive atmosphere that many parents find overwhelming and pointed out concerns over substance use at after-parties. The pressure to look slim, trendy, and have flawless skin is also said to be quite stressful. Mr. Beirne concluded he can't handle the risks tied to the prom. So, instead, the school will hold a celebratory mass for Year 13 students and their families, followed by drinks. Beaulieu Convent, where tuition runs \u00a35,400 a year, has about 760 students from ages 4 to 18.

Under Mr Lamb's plan, taxes would not be increased as the new levy would be offset by deductions to income tax or national insurance. He has warned the NHS faces collapse without an urgent cash injection. The plans are not yet party policy and will not be put to this year's conference in Bournemouth. But Mr Lamb, the party's health spokesman, told party members he was \"very interested in the idea of a dedicated NHS and care contribution - separating it out from the rest of taxation, clearly identified on your payslip. \"And I am really interested in the idea of the right for local areas to raise additional funds for the NHS and care if they choose.\" The Lib Dems say he would like to implement the ideas across the UK, although, as health and social care are devolved, it is unclear how this would be enforced. Mr Lamb - who lost out to Tim Farron in a leadership election in July - proposes a cross-party commission to explore the ideas. He intends to consult health bodies and professionals, patients, trade unions and academics. Ministers have pledged \u00a32bn in this financial year for the NHS, and an extra \u00a38bn by 2020. But Mr Lamb told the BBC that this was insufficient and, having \"seen the books\" as a minister in the last government, he feared the NHS could face a funding shortfall of \u00a330bn by 2020. \"The bottom line is with rising demand because of an ageing population we need more investment,\" he said. Mr Lamb also warned that the social care system was \"on its knees\" and could collapse without a cash injection of \u00a35bn. \"I've been in the department. I have seen the books and I am deeply concerned. If we carry on regardless, the system will crash.\" Taxpayers are already shown how much they have contributed to the health service in annual personal tax statements.

Though the plans have not yet become party policy and won't be presented at this year's conference in Bournemouth, Mr. Lamb, the party's health spokesperson, expressed great interest in an exclusive NHS and care contribution, distinctly separate from other taxes and visible on payslips. He is also keen on allowing local areas to raise additional funds for the NHS and care services if they choose.

Mr. Lamb, who was defeated by Tim Farron in the leadership election in July, suggests forming a cross-party commission to explore these concepts. He plans to consult with health organizations, professionals, patients, trade unions, and academics. While ministers have pledged \u00a32 billion for the NHS this financial year, with an additional \u00a38 billion by 2020, Mr. Lamb told the BBC that this is inadequate, warning of a potential \u00a330 billion funding gap by 2020 unless more investment is made due to the growing demand from an aging population.

Sepsis is triggered by infections and causes around 37,000 deaths a year in the UK. NHS England says hospitals should work together to tackle the problem. Sepsis usually develops from blood poisoning and involves a dramatic reaction by the body's immune system. If not treated quickly it can lead to organ failure or death. Early symptoms can include a high temperature and a fast heartbeat. The Intensive Care Society recently launched a campaign to raise awareness of sepsis to avoid what it says are thousands of preventable deaths. There are 37,000 deaths a year in the UK because of sepsis, compared with just more than 35,000 from lung cancer and 16,000 from bowel cancer. The society, along with the UK Sepsis Trust, argues that there is inadequate recording of sepsis cases by hospitals and insufficient knowledge of the steps required to recognise and treat it early. Julie Bignone nearly died because of sepsis and spent seven weeks in hospital - some of them in a critical condition. Feeling feverish, she assumed she had a bad dose of flu. After a weekend in bed, she went to her GP and was told to come back if her condition worsened and antibiotics would be prescribed. But later that day, with her family growing more anxious she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Julie was found to have pneumonia in both lungs and sepsis and doctors feared she might not survive. She only pulled through after several weeks in intensive care and heavy doses of antibiotics. She feels now that she should have acted on her instinct early on that she was suffering from something a lot worse than flu. Julie says: \"There's a lot of scope for getting it wrong with sepsis because the symptoms are not specific enough - we need to get a system where doctors listen to patients more and allow them to have more of an opinion\". Prof Bellamy, who is based at the Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, said: \"For the first time this year I have had a couple patients for whom we had no effective antibiotic treatment, it's rare - but two years ago it would still have been regarded as a theoretical problem.\" He says it is crucial to raise the profile of sepsis, and to ensure it is tackled early to give the patient the best chance of survival. The diminishing impact of antibiotics, in his view, underlines the urgency of the task.

Sepsis, a serious condition arising from infections, results in about 37,000 deaths annually in the UK. That's a staggering number, and NHS England is urging hospitals to band together to tackle this problem. Sepsis often stems from blood poisoning, causing a fierce immune response that can quickly lead to organ failure or even death if not treated promptly. Some early warning signs are fever and a racing heartbeat. To prevent more deaths, the Intensive Care Society recently launched a campaign to boost awareness about sepsis. In the UK, those 37,000 annual sepsis deaths outnumber fatalities from both lung cancer and bowel cancer, with the former claiming just over 35,000 lives and the latter around 16,000. The society, along with the UK Sepsis Trust, argues that hospitals don\u2019t record sepsis cases diligently or have adequate knowledge on spotting and treating sepsis in its early stages. Take the case of Julie Bignone, who nearly lost her life to sepsis. She spent seven weeks in the hospital, some of it in intensive care. At first, she thought she had a bad flu and stayed in bed all weekend. It was only after visiting her GP and being told to come back if things got worse that her family, growing worried, called an ambulance. Turns out, she had pneumonia and sepsis, and her life hung in the balance. It was intensive care and heavy doses of antibiotics that pulled her through. Julie says she should've trusted her gut when she felt something was seriously wrong. \u201cBecause sepsis symptoms are vague, it\u2019s easy to make mistakes. We need a system where doctors really listen to their patients' concerns,\u201d she insists.

The 5,017 days of detention were not only a real point of tension in the critical transatlantic relationship; they also soured and compromised attempts by the government to reach out to some of the hardest-to-reach Muslim communities. In the short term, he will begin to receive expert medical help, including a psychiatric assessment. He will finally get to meet the son who was born on the day he arrived at Guantanamo Bay. But for some, Mr Aamer's return represents a risk. Davis Lewin, of the Henry Jackson Society, a security and foreign relations think tank, has urged the UK to think very carefully about how it manages and monitors him now he is back. Mr Aamer's legal team have said he will submit to whatever monitoring is required - although they also argue it is unnecessary because the case against him comes from unreliable allegations extracted during torture. If MI5 decides to monitor him, he may never know for sure that it is happening - such is the nature of that kind of work. There are bigger questions for the UK, questions of legacy and lessons to be learnt. Critics argue that in the wake of 9/11 the US was not the only country to lose its legal map and moral compass. London didn't seem to want to tell Washington that Guantanamo was a bad idea - and it didn't insist that any British men detained in Afghanistan be brought back to the UK. That, say critics, was a dereliction of long-standing British principles of justice. \"Human rights and justice and the rule of law are for everybody,\" says former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, a member of the cross-party group that lobbied Washington to release Mr Aamer. \"He has been denied that. Not only is that terrible for him, but we have to be better than that if we're going to defeat the scourge of terror and terrorism. \"We're going to have to rise above these things and stick to the rule of law, and accept that human rights belong to everyone.\" Some American interrogations involved intelligence material provided by Britain - and that could amount to complicity in torture. And so, many MPs are now pushing for real answers to questions about Britain's role in the weeks and months after 9/11. \"One of the things that it is absolutely essential that happens in due course is that [Shaker Aamer] looks the camera in the eye in Britain and says what happened to him,\" says Mr Mitchell.", "text_ai_base": "Regardless of one's views regarding Mr. Aamer, his return to the UK was widely welcomed across Whitehall as a relief.

His legal team has stated he will comply with necessary monitoring, although they contend it's unwarranted, as the allegations against him were obtained through torture. If MI5 opts to monitor him, he might never be aware of it, given the covert nature of such work. Larger questions loom for the UK concerning legacy and lessons learned. Critics assert that post-9/11, the US wasn't alone in losing its legal and moral bearings. London's reluctance to advise Washington against Guantanamo and failure to demand the return of British detainees from Afghanistan was, according to critics, a neglect of Britain's justice principles. \"Human rights and justice and the rule of law are universal,\" states former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, part of the group lobbying for Mr. Aamer's release. \"He's been denied these rights.

They said \"greater flexibility\" was needed in parking policy to encourage more trade in town and villages. Parking enforcement in Northern Ireland was privatised in 2006. Initially, fines were levied at \u00a360, with the option of a 50% reduction if the bill was paid within a fortnight. However, in 2012, Stormont MLAs voted for the penalty to be increased to its current level of \u00a390 - or \u00a345 if it is settled within 14 days. The then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy said at the time that bigger fines would \"act as a greater deterrent to those who choose not to park properly\". The current minister said \"at least two thirds\" of people who receive parking tickets pay within two weeks, and therefore pay at the lower rate of \u00a345. \"I think, when we look across many states, this is an appropriate amount, \"Mr Hazzard added.

After the burglary, the Met Police launched an investigation into why after police were made aware an intruder alarm had gone off at the scene of the raid it was decided the alarm did not require a response. The force apologised for not following procedures and said it would investigate why the call was given a grade that meant no police response was deemed necessary. Five other men still face trial accused of conspiring to commit the burglary, a charge they deny. Hugh Doyle, 48, of Riverside Gardens, Enfield, north London; William Lincoln, 60, of Winkley Street, Bethnal Green, east London; and John Harbinson, 42, of Beresford Gardens, Benfleet, Essex, all also deny the laundering offence and are due to stand trial in November. Paul Reader, 50, of Dartford Road, Dartford, and Carl Wood, 58, of Elderbeck Close, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, are yet to enter pleas. Perkins' daughters also appeared in court, along with their husbands, accused of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property between 1 January and 19 May.

Although they were also charged with conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, the prosecution agreed not to pursue this charge following their guilty pleas for the burglary conspiracy. Earlier this month, a law firm announced that Hatton Garden Safe Deposit was liquidated because the company was insolvent and in debt to various creditors. The sentencing date for these men has yet to be determined. After the burglary, the Met Police began an investigation into why no response was made after an intruder alarm went off at the crime scene. The police apologized for not adhering to procedure and committed to investigating the decision to categorize the alarm call as not requiring a response. Five other men are still awaiting trial, having pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.

These four are yet to be sentenced. The Met Police was left in hot water post-burglary due to a lack of response when an intruder alarm triggered at the scene.
