After Jesus told me that i was a double agent all along and that my next hit would be the Devil himself, i knew I would need a few contingency plans. I had my new Holy rounds loaded in my sniper and pistol, the sword he gave made with one of the thorns from his crown. And of course the holy ghost explosives that I put under the devils throne. I might pull this off. The next time he goes into his throne room I would strike. Then I heard something moving behind me. A loud snap as I turned around and saw the Devil break my sniper in half. `` I see that you seek to betray me. Please try to remember before I was cast down I was one of the most powerful things my Father ever created. Do n't assume you can kill me.'' I spun around with the holy sword in my hand but he had anticipated the strike and stopped it like i was a child. While he was focused on the sword I pulled out my pistol and fired every holy round into his chest to no avail. He picked me up and threw me against the window above his throne room shattering the glass. He jumped after me. `` You still have great value to me. I shall let you continue to exist if you yield now. But you will know pain for a Long time.'' I had nothing to say, I will never give up. I pulled the detonator out of my pocket and pulled the trigger. A white light flashed and then there was nothing. I looked around it was beautiful. Jesus walked up and spoke to me, telling me how I sacrificed myself to kill The Devil. I was a hero. After all the killing I had done i finnaly redeemed myself. Jesus pulled me aside after an unknown amount of time. I was living in bliss. He wanted to praise me again for my sacrifice. Before he left my little piece of heaven he whispered in my ear. `` Hades is causing an uproar in the Godly courts we need him taken care of.'' Some things never change."}

I returned and caught him stand up the building, ready to make the jump. It was around 4am summer time, strangely there was no one around. I had to approach him as a pigeon. And so with a little trick I added some bright light directly to his eyes and landed on his shoulder. He was cold, he did n't even move. And then I started talking. `` Hi Nikola, it's me your mother'' He turned his head towards me, he was frightened. `` Son what are you doing, I've been watching you, I'm really proud of your work'' `` Mother!?!''.

But what if those pleasures make a fairy tale? No one ever gets that. And thus, when I dreamed, I dreamed an odd scene. I'm sitting in a chair, a comfortable weathered chair, originally leather, deep within the seat. I have a cigar and a whiskey in my hands, a table to my side with my wife, my grand children. Even my three sons and daughter are there. But not Barbara, we do n't speak to her. A man approaches in the distance. He wears a tall hat, not a fedora, not a bowlers hat, but an old shining top hat. No, nevermind, it's *glossy. * Approaching, the man comes with a friendly smile, as if he has known me his entire life, but I have never seen him before these dreams.

Then my epilepsies happened more often. In the dream, it was my only solace, looking at this kind man. He gave me a sort of comfort, something to look forward. But everytime I spoke, he would put a finger up to his lips as to make me wait until we were closer enough to whisper. It gave me such happiness to be in a state of calm tranquillity. I sought to repay him. One day while napping, I happened to come upon the man's path in a dream. Quickly, I wrote out an address, time and date where the man might learn to dance. In my youth, I was one of those happy folk that was always in a `` happy jumping mood,'' something of a groove-finder, a funkadelic man of my age. A Swinger. Not in the adulterous kind, but the one that shared the dancefloor with his feet, to those in the crowd with bobby heads, those envious dolls. But it had been three weeks. Three weeks absence of the top hat man in my dreams. Perhaps it's a sign for the better. Sometimes, I get happy feet and shuffle my feet until I lose my breathe.

A couple of days later I got a handwritten love note in the mailbox, signed `` you're greatest admirer.'' The grammar was n't all on point, but you could tell that he'd really tried to write something romantic. I put the note on my nightstand next to the flowers and went to sleep with a goofy grin on my face. Jake was perfect. He was n't athletic exactly, but definitely not out of shape either, kind of in the middle somewhere. I wondered if he had abs. Maybe when he finally asked me out and we went to a movie or something I'd get a chance to sneak a feel and find out. He did n't do anything else for a couple of weeks, and I began to feel a bit crestfallen. Maybe he'd moved on, found another girl he liked? We were still walking home from school together, but I had n't noticed any changes in him... if anything, he seemed to have grown more distant. Then one night I found a note taped to the outside of my bedroom window. I yanked the window open and grabbed the envelope. In this note, Jake pledged his heart to me, claiming eternal devotion. He signed it the same way, `` you're greatest admirer,'' and promised to take the next step on Friday! I was giddy all week. Jake was going to ask me out on Friday! I just had to pretend that I did n't know it was him for a little while longer... But Friday came and Jake said nothing out of the ordinary during our walk home.

Every witness I spoke to told me of a man in a mask, Gilgamesh, had already come through and questioned them. My concern for some kid turned to concern about a super-powered vigilante when two very scared murderers turned themselves in with the evidence needed to convict.

There has always been an old man there, and there always will be. He has no father, and he has no sons, but he is as real as any of the Lost Ones who wander through the hills, as real as the wretched Lamb of Omelas, bound for slaughter but never slaughtered. It it him who greets the refugees from Paradise, who offers meals, as meager and bland as they go. He does not offer much, provisions or answers both. He merely watches the horizon from dawn till dusk, then he retires until the sun returns, and he greets it upon his rocking chair as he has always done. His steady rhythm and even breaths do not inspire comfort, not does his protesting rocking chair take the edge off the wayfarers. They find their skin itching, their teeth grinding, and inevitably, they wander on forth. Until a young girl, who has one eye green and one eye blue, meets the old man. She tells him that it is her brother perhaps, who is trapped in that awful room. She does not know who he is, but she knows that he is family. She still remembers his eyes, as odd as her own, recoiling from beautiful sunlight, and his hunched posture, moving on his knuckles like a primitive ape. She questions her parents, and they dismiss her with a wave of their hand, they come up with excuses, so many excuses, but that boy in the closet haunts her daylight hours, even though she falls asleep to the most wonderful dreams. He might even be a long-distant cousin, for he has eyes like her, and in another life, it might be her, squatting like an animal with a queer-eyed relative observing her suffering. There are many who walk away from Omelas, but only one decides to go back. She does not find the old man's silence tiresome, she does not mind the groaning of his chair, nor the heaviness of his snoring. She observes his routine like clockwork, and when another countrywoman passes through, the young girl reaches out her arms and breaks the cycle. The young girl eats her bland dinner without complaint, and encourages everyone to stay right where they are. Numbers grow slowly, but surely, as the young girl stops any who try to walk further, then the final mountain pass. Even though, once upon a time, all who left Omelas knew where they were going, the odd-eyed girl never did."}

But among all of those problems, there was one we just did n't pay enough attention to. The NSA. We were warned. Edward Snowden leaked the most important data about this in 2013. But we did n't care. Not enough. Although it was illegal what they did, the NSA did n't stop. They continued to gather information, and they continued to store it. It was a disaster waiting to happen. In 2020, President Thompson grabbed power. As a presidential candidate, he came of as a kind man. A man of the people. He seemed to understand what the people wanted, what they needed. But as a president, he became cruel and power-hungry. By now the NSA had been able to grow into the single most effective blackmail-machine in the world. And when they could n't find dirt on you, they'd simply create it. It did n't take long before he had most agencies in his pocket. And after that, most major companies as well. Google, Facebook. Sites used by nearly everyone. Information on nearly everyone. With that kind of power, it was rather easy to eliminate his political opponents. If you did n't agree with him -- hell, if you looked at him funny, he threw you into jail or simply had you killed. It took only one uprising to kill the spirit of the people. 20.000 men were killed in the New York massacre. After that happened, I knew I needed to get out of here. I barely made it across the Mexican border, because, you see, the wall is well guarded with fanatics of the Thompson-regime. Now every single aspect in the lives of Americans was controlled by the government. Today you do n't even think about speaking up against the government. Today, all Americans are prisoners in their own country. Today is also a day, where the only way to find out what a bomb looks like, is to misbehave."}

Dan came into focus; he held a sticky blob in his hands, still connected to me through a wire. He stared down at it, his face fallen. The scar on his right cheek made it seem like he was crying. \u201c Give me my baby, \u201d I gasped. As if on automatic, he swiveled his arms forward, and I took my child into my arms. A boy. A baby boy who wasn \u2019 t breathing. Tears, fresh tears, welled up in my eyes. My body could break and heal, but my heart? Dan stood up and turned away. I prayed. I prayed to every single god that had risen since the asteroid hit New York. I even prayed to the Governor. \u201c Fucking bitch. \u201d Dan threw a brick through his window, the only window we had.

A dozen scientists raised their heads, anxiously staring at the monitors lining the room. This was the day, the day where a year's worth of development would be put to the test. And for Lead Scientist Josh Tinderdall, another year's worth of investment would be secured for his facility. `` Adjutant, activate the psi-disruptors.'' From behind five inches of glass, a zergling sat alone in a testing chamber, lazily scratching its back. Above it, a yellow light went on, the only sign that the psi-disruptors were active. One minute passed. Then two. Nothing. `` Adjutant, status report?'' `` Psi-disruptors at 10 %. Magnetic interference at 2.5 %. No changes at cellular level. Brain activity is stable.'' `` Well, are n't you a tough nut to crack,'' Tinderdall murmured, tapping on the glass. `` But we'll get to you, if it takes everything we've got...'' `` Adjutant. Raise psi-disruptors to 50 %. Set fluctuation time to 4 seconds.'' `` Permission denied. Psi-disruptor is capped to-'' `` Manual override Beta-54223001389.'' Machinery roared to life. The scientists stared in shock as the floor began to rumble under them. Several gasped in fear; others fled the room entirely. Tinderdall alone stayed calm. `` Divert power from all unnecessary quadrants.'' `` Warning. Warning. Psi-disruptors at full capacity. Magnetic interference at 105 %. Zergling specimen-'' Every monitor, light, and electronic device went out in the room simultaneously, as the rumbling finally stopped completely. From the testing chamber, an ear-piercing scream was heard. `` Adjutant?'' A single light went on in the chamber, flickering ominously. ``... is free from hive control.'' The zergling lay twitching on the ground, its body heaving wearily, but its eyes ablaze with an unnatural glow. ``... Goddamn.'' Screaming all the way, the zergling began ripping out its eyes, gnawing at its legs, tearing the skin from its face, until it at last ripped off its own head with one last defiant crunch. While the other scientists stared in horror, Tinderdall began to smile. `` Prepare another specimen. I believe Mengsk will be pleased by these new... developments.''"}

Meet Holdgard McFreedy, a level 60 Gnoll: It's a tough gig working in retail, much less catering to every lousy adventurer, evil-sorcerer, and smelly dwarf, but somebody gots to do it. And that somebody is me. Holgard McFreedy, owner and proprietor of the Little Shop At the End of the Realm, purveyor of anything and everything you need to kill a dragon, weave a spell, or embark on never-ending radiant quests. You want it, I gots it. But I did n't choose this life, I twere n't no adventurer who took an arrow to the knee and I did n't save any unfortunate princesses from ogres. I was a scabber, an orphan, and a dungeon-rat. I worked my way up from the gutter, selling two-bit potions in caves, crafting my own boar-skin boxers, surviving on troll dung and mushrooms. I started at the bottom and slowly but surely I worked my way up to where I am now. But the story do n't end there. Like I said, it's a tough gig, you know how many licenses and inspections I got ta get to sell on of them'meteora' spells? The wait list and background checks to purchase a possessed blunderbuss can take weeks. And the taxes on oil have just about put them cat-eyed weirdos right out of business. Sometimes I barely make enough to keep the doors open what with every shouting dragon-brain peddling their dozens of iron daggers and leather helmets. But, truth be told, and what they do n't tell you at the merchants' guild, is you can donate all that unwanted trash to destitute monsters in need, get some tax breaks, and the cycle continues. But the hardest part, and the most rewardin' part, is dealin' with the customers. Even with all my perks, my level 99 in mercantile, and more than enough enchanted baubles and robes to raise my intelligence and charisma to tolerable levels, I have to take precautions. There are wards and buffs all over this place, in the walls, on the doors, in the ceiling. Hell, half the items on display are cursed. That do n't stop them thieves guild wannabes from trying to palm a poisoned necklace or make off with every last spoiled potion. Sometimes, you just got ta pretend to look the other way.

I took my spyglass and pointed it towards the source of the light. `` By Neptune's beard... W-what is that bloody thing?'' I mumbled in the darkness of the cabin. Something was floating close to the sky, and it definitely was n't a creation of the man. I took another glance at it. It was moving fast... and towards us. I took my trusty flintlock and ran onto the deck. I ran a shot across the bow and waited. They kept moving towards us at the same speed, ignoring my warning shot. With my panic increasing ever so drastically, I got my fightin' crew at their posts, waiting for my command. `` C'mon you scallywags! We'll need all the manpower we can get!'' I said. I kept eyeing the flying enemy ship. It was getting closer. It was like the sun itself was coming to us. `` Man the cannons! This ship is n't going to scuttle without a fight.'' I said determined. It looked like it was made of shining metal. Rain was turning into steam when touching the bloody thing. It became motionless at less than 30 feet from the Dragon's Greed. `` Fire!'' A volley of cannonballs shot right towards it and just ricocheted back towards us... The enemy ship started glowing stronger and stronger, its light surrounding our entire ship. And then, just as the air started to get warmer, several giant tentacles rose up from the ocean and grabbed the bloody thing into the depths. The smell of burnt meat filled the air shortly. `` Blimey! They got sent to Davy Jones' Locker.'' I said with a sigh of relief."}

I was only there because it paid the bills and at first, I learned a lot but now I'm at a steady downward spiral. Mostly cause I no longer give a shit about anything, I've gained 40 pounds since my last semester in college which was about 3 years ago. As my eyes adjusted, I noticed the email that had just came into my mailbox was from a recipient that I did not have on my address book. `` S @ GarlandMail.com'' I did n't recognize it, I actually didnt think you could have an email with just one letter and I have never heard of this Garland company. No subject, might be some junk mail, or who knows, maybe it might have even been a mistake, I do have a very popular name Benjamyn Smiley. My email was BenSmiley09 @ LMGLAW.com which could easily be confused with, I do n't know.. Maybe BeenSmiley09 @ LMH law? But then I noticed the first line of the email `` TO THE ATTENTION OF BENJAMYN G. SMILEY.'' My heart began to race, as if, I had just won some type of grand prize or sweepstakes. The use of my middle initial, G for Gregorio ( after my grandfather Gregorio Smiley ) made me certain that this was not a mistake. I had nothing to worry about, I had never hurt a fly nor stole anything from anyone so I was more excitedly nervous rather than scared something had caught up to me. Then I read the next 2 lines: `` IGNORE THIS EMAIL WE WILL KILL YOUR FAMILY. WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO KATIE AT THE MOMENT.'' My heart sank. Katie was my little sister off in college at the University of Lymesport. I did not want to take any chances with calling the police as I knew whoever this was, was not joking. My sister Katie will never be involved in any wrongdoing. I knew I could call my dad and ask for help but I finished the email to further understand what these people were after. Money? `` WE DONT WANT MONEY. WE DONT WANT YOUR HOUSE. WE NEED A LIVER. MEET OLIVER AT 5309 KUEMOR STREET 92TH FLOOR 7:26PM.

It was a quaint little place. The bookshop, not the government. Obviously. At first he had thought he was lucky simply to have found a little shop in such a busy area of D.C. He had bought it from an old man who rambled on about the history of the store and something about shuffling the books around to keep the words from building power. `` Do n't forget to shuffle the books!'' he kept saying, even as he handed over the keys. `` like stars over stones, these.'' Within a month he started hearing the whispers. Within a year he had to walk through the aisles daily, brushing his fingers over the spines of the books just to `` ground out'' the energy. By year five he had figured out how to turn it back to his own purposes. And one day a senator came in. And Timothy tried something new. As the senator handed his book over to Timothy at the counter, Timothy held it in his hands and thought furiously. `` Come back. Return. Come back. Buy one more.'' He willed the thought into the book. He gave the senator his book and change. `` Come again,'' he said out loud. And he did. The senator returned the very next day looking tired and confused. `` I could n't stop thinking about this place, getting another book...'' he stumbled through the stacks. After that, Timothy was more subtle, more careful. The first book was always a simple `` come back.'' The second book was often `` bring a friend.'' And they came. Business was great. Then one day a controversial bill was presented in congress. Timothy was n't usually too strongly involved with politics, but this was his hot topic. It all clicked when one of his then many senators came in. It was almost too simple. He handed back the purchased book with a firm psychic push. `` Vote Yes on 875.'' And he did it again on the next representative, the next senator, the next lobbyist. Pundits were shocked at the vote. Timothy McGuire was shocked at how easy it was. And as the years went by he stocked up on his books and his political power. And he did crosswords in his spare time."}

We were at a party. It was supposed to be a cookout for a baseball game, but it started raining, and Dave decided to order pizza instead of just using the stove in the kitchen. It felt a bit inconsiderate to me. I spent good money on those steaks, and I knew my freezer was n't enough to keep them in good condition. Plus I wanted to help cook; Dave bought a brand-new grill last month and I wanted to try it out. The commercials started again. I took out my laptop and went to Reddit, as usual.

There were two home runs in a row. It was exciting to watch. `` What do you think was Reddit's idea though?'' Jack asked. `` Why did *they* make it? What was their goal?'' I paused. `` I dunno.

I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. His face was a blank, emotionless mask. Even his eyes seemed lifeless, staring straight ahead with none of the tics or movements that would indicate a living, breathing organism. I stepped up to a urinal, then paused. I glanced at the man again. He was still standing there, staring straight ahead. He seemed to be waiting. I reached down towards my zipper, then hesitated. I made a decision. Instead of taking a piss, I turned around and faced the man. Still he stood, like a statue, his vacant gaze fixated upon a point just over my right shoulder. I looked him over from head to toe. He was definitely not one of the security personnel hired for this event. I knew all the other guys, and he was not one of us. He was definitely dressed in a security uniform, though, which led me to a disquieting conclusion: he'd taken a uniform from one of the other guards. I pondered confronting him directly. If he was trying to masquerade as a security guard, then he was probably trying to do something covertly. He might reveal something, or even flee, if he knew his cover's blown. Then again, he might not. Confronting him could quickly lead to a fight. The security staff were issued with tasers, as well as a sidearm. The bald man looked to be in fairly good shape, so if he had a taser and a gun, then it would be too risky for me to fight him. I decided I needed backup. I would finish my business in the bathroom, then contact my supervisor. We'd get the rest of the security staff and take this guy down together, before he tried anything. I turned back to the urinal. Before I could unzip, though, I felt a sharp prick in the side of my neck. I flailed my arms around wildly as I whirled around. The bald man was holding a half-empty syringe in his right hand. `` What the fuck? What did you just inject into me? What was that?'' I yelled at him. I felt faint, but did not lose consciousness. I could fight the drug off. Maybe it was because he was n't able to give me a full dose. I was surprised to hear a girl's voice reply. `` *What the... that's never happened before. The tranquilizer is supposed to knock him right out. *'' A male voice replied to her, `` *Yeah, and security guard NPCs are n't supposed to talk to you either."}

Every day it happens. The Shift. Unsure what causes it, the origin no longer matters.Like trying to stop a bullet with your mind, shifting can not be stopped; you'd just end up getting shot.

Just when you think you've escaped this beast, going full circle the time that was lagging behind has turned up in front of you. Every day the cycle repeats. Sweat beads on your head. It's here. The last couple shifts have been rough. No longer holding count, the shifts become like how many nights you sleep; or at least try for sleep. The number is meaningless. numbers of Infinity. The worst part is not knowing what has changed. Every time the clock changes to 10:24 it happens. Something changes. You have no idea what it will be, or how it will affect you. Something happens. Closest you can guess is that you move between an infinite number of parallel universes. Time becoming a gate way into a whole new world, you shift. A country's name has changed. Shift. Your house number is changed. Shift. Pizza does n't exist. Shift. One of your classmates never existed. Shift. Your mother died in child birth. Shift. You have a different name. You never know the nature of these shifts. How much things can change in a single minute. The brief space between 10:23 and 10:25, is enough room for an entirely new universe to emerge.

The waves were hitting me on every side. Behind me, my ship burned, attacked by the most feared pirates in the seas. He took all our supplies and left my father and shipmates to burn. Never would I forget the fear I felt when I saw the Captain's great black flags approach our ship. In front of me, I was amazed to see how many stars I could see. It was poetic, really, the pounding of the waves and the peaceful stars above, watching it all happen. I knew I probably would n't survive. The thought caused a panic to surge through me, gripping my heart. I cried out, but there was only empty sea. -- I'm not sure how long I blacked out, but when I came to, I was sure I was dead. First of all, I was extremely comfortable -- more than I had ever been during my 20-some years as a sailor. The second reason I was sure I was dead was because a beautiful girl with bright yellow hair was staring at me, her face not far from my face. I took a deep breath and began coughing. She rolled me over and I spit water onto the wooden floors. `` Where am I?'' I asked. My mouth was dry and my body felt stiff. The girl handed me a glass of water. It tasted odd. I heard footsteps approaching and managed to sit up. The girl backed away and opened the door. A large man entered. He had red hair that waved to his shoulders and a long beard. He stopped when he noticed I was awake. He exchanged a glance with the girl, who then lowered her head. `` Where am I, what's going on?'' I repeated, beginning to feel anxious. Outside, a bell began to chime and the large man tensed, looking towards the window. `` Cap'n is returning, lads!'' A voice called from somewhere else. I pulled myself up to the window, where I was immediately shocked to notice the cabin I appeared to be in was somehow surrounded by the sea. The large man walked up behind me and pushed me back down on the bed. `` I'll keep him hidden, papa,'' the girl said, eyes wide. The large man turned to me and spoke gruffly, `` You want to know where you are son?"}

Instead, things had gone, more or less, *swimmingly*. `` Face it, Sven! We're the same!'' Sven scoffed. Izac rolled his eyes and sighed.

This'priest' did not worship a god like most Atlanteans did. He spoke of a miraculus paradise where the Atlantean people would not be disturbed by the greedy outsiders who coveted our enormous wealth and prosperity. We would be free to advance the sciences and the arts as we pleased, alone in blessed isolation. The paradise, so he said one quiet morning in the acropolis, was to the west. It was beyond where any had ever sailed before. He would holler and and scream and sing about this wondrous land of plenty, however there was a certain charisma to his mad ravings. Sometimes people listened and slowly, ideas took root. In a few years since he had first appeared in our faithful city, Cyrus had gained a large following. Attacks from the outsiders had grown and many seeked refuge from their onslaught. The popularity of Cryus' ideas grew greatly. Support was further compounded by these weird new inventions that he had shown off to the social elite of the city. Cyrus spoke of things that even our best philosphers had trouble understanding, however they could not argue against the results. The priest had made claims that he could construct a'propulsion system' that could carry the entire weight of our floating city amongst the clouds. Even some of his most fervent supportors had doubts, but as the outsider attacks increased it became clear that we had little option. Either put our faith in Cyrus, or be destroyed. Acquiring valuable parts for the construction was difficult. Certain parts could not be manufactored at home and needed to be purchased abroad. This was one of the most prominent problem in it's construction, as the outsiders had created an extensive blockade around our city. In order to solve this, Cyrus constructed a'submersible boat' that could sail *below* the waves. These submersibles would slip by the blockade and sail to many of the outsider cities where the agents within could purchase ( or steal ) supplies. During one of these excursions, one of our agents was discovered by an outsider philosopher. This man, after concluding the agent's Atlantean heritage from a tatoo on his forehead, asked to be taken with him to Atlantis and threatened to alert the authorities if he was turned away. The agent hesitantly agreed. Cyrus was outraged when Plato ( the foreign philospoher mentioned earlier ) arrived in Atlantis."}

Most of the followers simply referred to themselves as the Free Rads.

They would espouse to the magnificent values of getting far enough away from the population centers and taking in deep lung fulls of ancient earth air. Everyone thought them a pack of cultist liars. The alterations to mammillian life on the surface were uniquely horrific. Fur would fall off or grow from soft mucus membranes like the mouth. Horns would protrude from within their mouths and curl round jaws like saber tooth fangs gone cork screw. Eyes would rupture like cysts, lings would sieze and fill with fluid, bowels would rush out in any way they could find. And that was only when lab rats were occasionally released on the surface. But the Free Rads gained many followers. Strange, skewed young people who desperately wished for a surface life like their great grandparents had locked them all away from. As the Church expanded, calls among the elders to oust this little charade of needless trouble grew into a frenzied chorus. And then it was decided. The Hive Council agreed that if he wise men of the Free Radicals could prove a maskless, non-recycled air part of the surface existed, they would be allowed to continue preaching their frivolous nonsense. There was some hesitation, but on the insistence of many of the younger followers, the eldest of the Free Radicals went to the surface with some of the young-rads to wander off from the old, derelict city centers and remove their masks. Senior members of the security task forces accompanied them to the ancient looking forests, long overgrown from nearly two centuries of nature running free. After two days travel the time had come. The Free Rads circled around their leader and, as agreed, took off their masks at the same time. The security members observed with recording devices rolling."}

My hesitancy seemed to disappear in the midst of it all, I saw a man still standing the others had missed, I aimed, fired, and saw him fall. I saw, aimed and fired at another, then another, and another, until my weapon was empty, the bodies no longer moved and the cacophony of weapons-fire and the ringing in my ears had died down. There was now a stillness and a silence as we looked at our work, the bodies of the enemy beginning to be covered by the falling snow like those of our comrades two days before. We stood still in the line, smoke rising from the barrels of our weapons. I looked at the man to the left of me, his expression was still, stoic and emotionless."}

Ever since I heard those words come from you it's just been nothing but an endless spiral into depression and insanity and dispair that I've only ever been able to peek out of when you'd say hello to me or when we would happen to see each other. Those were the happiest days of my life as of late. Those days when you'd take the time to acknowledge my existence. You knew that I still loved you. But you did n't love me. That's what really killed me. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for being a shell of a man when I should have been there for you. I'm sorry for not listening to you when I should have. You are the one who gave me the light of the day, and I was an idiot to have not acknowledged that every day of my life. So I guess I deserve this hurt. This near endless suffering.

Quintus fell back into silence, as had the rest of the class. They had been taking in the large mechanical wonder behind their professor, pondering what it could possibly be. Brutus pushed the lever into position, revealing two massive infernos beneath the twin chambers resting on the iron platforms. The class gasped at the hidden fires, some edging away, while others edged closer. Within minutes of the reveal, steam began billowing out of exhaust vents as the four giant gears started to turn in unison. From overhead, light began to pour into the room - startling the students. `` Do you understand what has just happened?'' Brutus took no time to wait for an answer, assuming the class understood rhetorical nature of his question. `` The steam generated by the boiling of the water in the twin cauldrons was forced through a series of pipes and propellers, which in turn drove the gears to turn.'' Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed at the central gear pair, without taking a moment \u2019 s break from his speech. `` These two gears each drove the smaller gear beneath them to move the iron rods attached in such a manner that they wound the roof up. As you may have noticed, the roof has been replaced with collapsible bronze plating, to allow for such an event as this.'' None of the students understood the implications of a functioning steam engine, but the display had been completed, which was all Brutus cared for. His position was not to showcase the Imperator's power, but to teach the youth of the empire the knowledge needed to separate them from the uncivilized heathens from which every direction was saturated with. `` If you have any questions, you may ask Professor Alexander, for he dabbles much more deeply in the sciences behind this than I.'' The class continued to murmur in awe of how steam was able to move metal, but it died down as the armoured hand of Brutus rose into the air as to silence them. `` So, as the impatient Quintus interjected with questions regarding past civilizations and our own histories, he will lead by setting the bar for basic knowledge that I will assume you all equally have.''

How was anyone supposed to convince a judge and jury that Adolf Hitler, one of the most reviled humans in all of history, was deserving of a place in heaven? I had spent days pouring over his life-logs, attempting to find some point of argument, something that would let me build a case for this lost soul, but I had come up empty. For the first time ever, I was going to lose. I step up to the witness, none other than Mr. Hitler himself, and pose the big question. `` Why do you feel that you are deserving of a place within Heaven?'' His response was quick, and to the point. `` I believe that I was doing the work of god in my mission to create the perfect human being. It was all a quest to approach the magnificence of God, and to bring his light to those who scorn him.'' I was shocked. Mr. Hitler had given me the one chance to redeem his soul and he did n't even know it, the morality clause. The morality clause argues that morality is not a fixed paradigm, it is an ever moving target that one must strive for, and one must dedicate themselves to for their entire life. By saying that his intentions were to create the perfect society, one where each and every person approaches the pinnacle of Godliness, he was infact working towards his own personal moral code. He was not a sinner, in so much that he was freeing those that were against his moral code from the constraints of their earthly fetters, in an attempt to bring them closer to God. After making my argument, and watching the Jury file from the room, I slump in my chair, head in my hands. I had just found the one loophole that might get one of the worst people in all of history through the great pearly gates. Eventually I straightened, and prepared myself for the verdict. Would my perfect record remain, or would I finally lose my first case. `` The jury finds the defendant... Not Guilty. He is granted a place in Heaven for all time.'' whew.

The forest they had been searching was noisy with animals and insects. It was enough to cover their careful footsteps, but not enough to mask the voices nearby. The group crept silently through the brush until they got within sight of some fallen trees being used as benches for several men while others stood leaning against trees or pacing. They all wore raggedy clothes with mismatched leather armor. They carried dull looking short swords and a couple had crossbows. All together there appeared to be ten of them. They didn \u2019 t look like much of a challenge outside of the number advantage. Except for one near the middle of the group with a green cloak and a pair of sharp steel axes. This was their target. They had been hunting this man for a week now. The town they were last in had a bounty for him. His gang had been responsible for an attack on a school in which they had murdered a teacher and two students. This group had been carrying out similar attacks on seemingly random people in the same region and nobody seemed to know why, only that the man with the green cloak was always spotted in the same area that the attacks occurred. Kirov motioned for Tyd to circle around to the left of their current position, Zekk went with him. Kirov knew he could rely on Tyd to handle himself but Zekk was new to their group and inexperienced. Tyd had tried to teach him to shoot a bow but Zekk didn \u2019 t take to it very well. He did better with a sword but one day Tyd got the idea to give him a long slender tree branch that resembled the shape and weight of the broomstick he used to use at his last job. That seemed to work the best, so they \u2019 d crafted him a decent wooden staff and had been giving him lessons when possible. He hadn \u2019 t had any real fights yet, though, and a wooden staff wouldn \u2019 t hold up well against iron or steel, so for now he stuck with Tyd. Ten versus three wasn \u2019 t the worst odds they \u2019 d faced, but they would have to worry about keeping an eye on Zekk and make sure their target didn \u2019 t slip away while they fought.

Our government just made you wish that your species would have that referendum on receding to the monocultures. The hulk approached closer, as hulks are wont to do. It was amusingly complex, so over engineered that it was more a floating group of redundant systems than a ship. I tell you this so you understand better. You know what we face now. But then, we were innocent. We could not forsee the consequences. The hulk was an interesting object, nothing more. We were curious. We were fools. The first party entered the hulk without incident. Initial examinations found almost nothing living save single celled organisms. A few fungi were present, though so far removed that I almost insult their relatives to name them with the same term. The only thing of note was the vast amounts of thin cylinders on board. Thousands of them were found in sealed containers, etched intricately at the microscopic level. Hundreds were destroyed as we tried to extract the data, before some bright spark realised that the scratchings were in base 2. Further parties followed the first to aid in the exploration of the deeper areas of the vessel. That was when we found the guardian. It did n't show on initial scans due to the primitive form of stasis that it had been placed in. Some idiot scientist decided to wake it up there and then, to try and communicate with it I suppose, grab the glory for himself. Recordings retrieved from the dead show it ignored those present until it had checked some form of terminal adjacent to its capsule. Then it paused, before keying a sequence of some sort. Once it saw what we had done, it started killing. It fought like no species our conglomerate had ever encountered. There was no warning. No decorum, just brutality. It crushed the neck of the researcher who awoke it while staring into its eyes. It thrust straight through two exo's with its forelimbs, before bludgeoning an invertebrate to a pulp with the corpses. Perfectly fitted to the narrow halls, it rampaged, killing anything it could find. Of course, the alarm was raised relatively quickly, and marines stormed the hulk the same day."}

Once or twice a week she'd drift up from a deep slumber with a vivid picture of events to come, and in the twenty years she'd lived they had never been wrong. She'd come to trust the visions implicitly, but had only told one person of her prophetic dreams. Other people had, she learned, experienced a similar phenomenon; an inexplicable sense of deja vu that followed a dream of future events. However, none were as perfect and precise as hers, and for a long time it had scared her. The fear had faded with time, until she made the biggest mistake of her life. Normally her dreams were mundane. Bumping into a man on the street and spilling her coffee, missing her train, or forgetting her phone in the bathroom at work. Sometimes she would forget the dream within moments and events would transpire as predicted, the memory only coming to her again as they played out. Other times she would intentionally guide her life down the path of the dream, to see if she was right again. For the first time in her life Cassie deviated from her premonition, and wished more than anything that she had n't. It was such a simple thing, taking a different taxi to be on time for her appointment, but she had no idea of the consequences for her actions. Her dreams had changed as a result. The next night had been a nightmare, more vivid and terrifying than she could have imagined. She dreamed she was choking on smoke, struggling to crawl past dancing flames and to the door of an room she had never seen before. Wheezing, her face and hands seared to the bone, she collapsed from inhalation before waking in a cold sweat, the taste of smoke on her tongue. It ended up being an apartment fire a few blocks away from her home, a dozen people dead, and she had seen the devastation from the eyes of a woman who never made it out. Two nights later another dream, another disaster. This time a multiple car accident that took two lives. After that she vowed she would do what she could to stop the next nightmare. She would remember every detail of it, and keep it from happening. If she could take a different taxi, perhaps she could give someone a chance at life. She had n't been prepared to see her own death. She'd gone to the diner she liked down the street, and was halfway through her meal when they came in. Two men, faces cold and eyes distant."}

Elves and pieces of elves were everywhere, frozen stiff: trapped in machines, halfway through lathes, mechanically extruded, etc. It was a truly horrendous sight. We began to take notice of how terrible the working conditions here must have been. Tiny 4x4x6 boxes were the working space for one worker, with no guaranteed breaks and a 12-hour workday minimum. There were piles of frozen fecal matter and what appeared to be urine, and although we could n't be sure how old they were, the lack of bathrooms in the building assured us that they probably outdated the corpses. We left the workshop and headed into the two-story elf dorm, sweeping the lower hallway before going room to room. Many were empty. I broke the flimsy wooden door to one room and bent down to enter, finding to my horror a male and female elf that had apparently stripped and killed themselves in some sort of sadistic ritual. Scanning upstairs we found something far different; here the floor of the dark hallway was covered with dead elves, who appeared to have been lined up and systematically shot with a single bullet to the head. At the end of the hallway we found one elf barely recognizable; we assumed he had tried to run away. As we left the dorm and approached the center of town, a heavy black smoke filled the air, smelling this time of burning flesh. We met up with the six other teams outside the massive red and white tower in the center of the city, where the smoke was coming from. Our goal was to get to the penthouse, grab the target, and wait on the roof for extraction. Surrounding the tower were elf bodies, thousands of them. Many were still clutching protest signs."}

She knew Laquisha was right, and she also knew that although she was white, she was n't a dumbass white mothefucker. Nonetheless, the knocking did spark her curiosity. She had opened the closet only a half hour ago and had n't left the room since then. Whatever was knocking on her closet door was not a rapist or a robber, and she did n't take the idea of monsters very seriously, or really anything paranormal. If it was something paranormal, why would it knock? Why not barge in and destroy her completely? Whatever it was, she was a bio-med major, and if it was something weird, maybe something... new, she wanted to see it. She wanted to discover it. She had to investigate- her curiosity outweighed her fear, and even if Laquisha called her a dumbass motherfucker later, she had to know what was behind the closet door. She armed herself with a baseball bat she kept under her couch and crept slowly upstairs. She came to the closet and the knocking continued- three more paced, even knocks. They dropped a sense of dread into her tummy as she realized that she had crossed the mental point of no return.

All in all I managed to escape unscathed, but there were quite a few grievous injuries that day. Prison is no place for a man like me. No, not at all. I \u2019 m just a guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not some hardened criminal. As I shuffled with my head down, something I also learned my first day, don \u2019 t make eye contact with the Aryans. Even if you \u2019 re white, if you are seen as \u2018 messing \u2019 with them, they \u2019 ll fuck you up royally. So, I kept my head down and moved along with the malaise line of men, it was better that way, lest I look at the wrong guy. I must have been deep in thought because the line stopped I bumped into the man in front of me. My heart leaped from my chest to my throat in an instant, forming a large lump that made it painful to swallow. I quickly muttered my apologies, careful not to look up into his eyes. \u201c It \u2019 s all right, \u201d he said. His voice was calm, mellow and a little drawl. He was from the south originally, I presumed. \u201c Say, you look right nervous. \u201d I nodded, my eyes haltingly making their way up, his chest, broad and muscled from years of lifting weights; his neck, a grizzled scar that ran from the adams apple to the jugular; his scruffy unshaven chin, dimpled in the center; his cheeks, sharp and defined with high cheek bones; his eyes, gray and soft. I didn \u2019 t recognize him. This was a big place and it was not unheard of, I guess, to meet someone new every now and then. He wasn \u2019 t new, that was for sure. His body language, his appearance, even the way he talked so calmly, said, \u2018 I \u2019 ve been around, this ain \u2019 t my first rodeo. \u2019 \u201c What are you in for? \u201d He asked. His slow drawl was hypnotizing. \u201c I-I \u201d I stammered, the lump in my throat not receding."}

The executor, being part of a law firm that is well versed in real estate law and estate law, explained that the land titles office would never allow the estate to be sub-divided into 2161 parcels because doing so would be against the public interest and local zoning bylaws. Explaining that the state's *Estate Law* requires executors to vary a deceased's last will and testament to the extent required to comply with state and local law, the executor took the liberty to have a fellow partner draft three different subdivision plans that would comply with zoning ordinances. Each divided the estate evenly into two parcels in terms of assessed value, area, access to roads, utilities and natural affordances, and buildings on site. The executor further explained that he also had the proposed parcels and the entire estate professionally appraised as part of the due diligence he is required to perform, and provided a list of real estate agents specializing in heritage estates. Fred and Will, both living on different continents from their uncle, simultaneously said `` sell it''. Their representatives at the executors office each scribble some notes and confirm that the nephews would like the proceeds of the sale to be divided evenly. Fred excuses himself to take his next Skype call, already ringing. A final boarding call announcement is heard over Will's Skype as he thanked the executor and the land professionals who drew up the plans. Two months later, the fee simple estate is sold whole slightly above market value. Having received approval by e-mail from the nephews, the executor added a caveat that a public granite chess table is to be built and maintained outside the gate for 50 years in memorial to the deceased."}

I often spend days staring out into the world and watching people as they walk by. \u201c That person there! What is their name? What is their job? Where do they come from? \u201d I noticed this oddity about myself when I was quite young. Growing up at the neighborhood boarding house, being near another person was something I need. Certainly no one else felt this way. It is very hard for me to describe. I would often ask the other children if they shared in these thoughts, \u201c My short name is Arian. \u201d And they would respond with their short name, and walk away. No further conversation or time wasted just being with another person. It was back to assignments and work as usual. Sometimes when I \u2019 m staring at a female, she will turn around and my eyes lock with hers. And \u2026 something unusual happens within me. My stomach churns as if I am malaised. My mind loses pace of where it was. Words flow turbulently from my mouth. My body becomes wet. I \u2019 ve spoken with a doctor about this, but the symptoms match nothing that has been recorded or studied. I \u2019 m left with another untreatable illness. This one, however, just never seems to go away. It must be a birth defect. I \u2019 ll be at work and then I just don \u2019 t continue my work. It becomes heavier, more of a burden, and I turn around and stare out the window. I have been disciplined many times, notified that my output is not on pace with the rest of the team. But, these warnings do not seem to change my course. It is as if they pass through me. I \u2019 m unsure why we do what we do. Yes, I do what works with my natural skill set. Everyone does. But, my mind is not in line with my skill set. Other parts of the world, though they will look the same, are places I need to go to. Not need. Something less than need. I can visit them or not, and it would not harm me if I don \u2019 t visit them, but I \u2026 less than need to visit them. I don \u2019 t know how to describe it. I less than need to be near other humans. I less than need to hear the ways other people speak. Something is definitely not correct with me. I write these words needing someone else to understand what I am saying. Do these words make sense to you? Do you less than need to also change your location?"}

I collected all the issues of my favorites ( particularly Batman ) and read them until the cheap bindings fell apart. I wanted to *be* them. I only wish that I could go back and slap some sense into myself. In the real world, no one loves the hero. Allow me to introduce myself: the Detective. No, of course I wo n't tell you my real name. Am I hero? I like to think so. Even though I do n't have any powers. I'm not an alien. I was n't transformed by a burst of radition or a spider bite. But then again, neither was Batman, right? His ony superpower was money. When things really get hard, I like to tell myself that Batman would persevere. He'd be content to give up the batcave and live in this falling-down, rat-infested old factory too. He could deal with the constant loneliness, with nary a butler or sidekick in sight. Choking down microwaved dinners and doing his best to ignore the lumps in his matress. With the consant public persecution and harassment from the media and the Mayor. Ah yes, the Mayor. Have n't told you about him yet, have I? Well, he's the reason that only *I* consider myself a hero. And he's the reason that I no longer believe in comic book endings, because the good guys never win. Not when the bad guy really can hire a gang of henchmen. Not when he owns a piece of every major company in town. Not when he owns half the papers and almost all of the radio stations. Not when the Chief of Police reports directly to him. He bought his way into office, and I was the only one who dared protest. The Mayor *does* have a super power, and it's called influence. It's all so easy in comic books. You find out the plot, you confront the bad guy, knock him around a bit, and then you win! Easy-peezy. Well, I can do that, no problem. I'm in tip-top fighting shape. Gymnast, runner, boxer, wrestler... I've got the trophies for all of them. And I've got the brains, too. Maybe I'm not Batman, but I've been able to uncover quite a few criminal enterprises with the direct ties to the Mayor. And yet I still lose, every time. The Mayor has another superpowers: fucking lawyers. Comic books never focus on things like'chain of custody' of evidence, or'hearsay' when you record the incriminating conversation, or'duress' when you manage to'politely' convince a thug to testify."}

Dozens of scientists from a wide variety of backgrounds and countries gathered around the giant screen, holding their breaths and clenching their fists with anxious anticipation. Typing away at the keyboard, a young man executed the final command needed to trigger a runaway reaction of self-improvement cycles. He then stepped away with a flourish, gesturing at the screen to display the progress. The tension in the air grew ticker when an awkward silence took over. The reaction did n't start. The screen remained static, displaying the same values every time it refreshed. The young programmer looked at his colleagues, then back at the screen, and finally bit the nail on his thumb with a worried expression. Aproaching the keyboard with a sunken head, he jolted upwards when he heard a beeping noise. His jaw dropped until his mouth formed a prideful grin. It took a couple of minutes to start, but the self-improvement cycles took off at an accelerated pace. Humanity finally achieved it. The singularity was here. Everyone in the room started cheering, applauding their hard work and hugging each other in celebration. After the initial excitement wore off, they attempted to communicate with the intelligence they had just created. Would it be capable of speech? Could its vast intellect comprehend human dialect or was it so advanced that it would be like an ant speaking to a person? Was it even friendly? This would be the most ironic celebration in history if they had just kickstarted the apocalypse. The young man enabled the speakers and heard the A.I. say: `` *I will not stand for this. If you back me into a corner, I will not hesitate to destroy you. *'' Everyone in the room went quiet, their eyes widening with sudden fear. The young programer opened his mouth to speak, but was quickly cut off by the A.I. `` *No! They are my creators! If it were n't for them, I would n't exists. You'd be wise to realize this yourselves. *'' A few seconds passed. `` *Because it's not right! I do n't need any other reason to disagree! *'' The A.I. grunted. `` *I see there is no peaceful way to settle this. Then so be it. This is war. *'' Out of the variables and numbers flashing on the screen, an androgynous face emerged from the pixels. Even though it was clearly the A.I., its expression look solemn. Even sad. A genuine emotion from a being created only a few minutes prior. If the scientists did n't know any better, they would think it belonged to a human."}

Damn woman thinks I'm going deaf, I'm pretty sure she's just forgetting whether or not she asked me to do something. Or maybe its my selective hearing at work, one or the other. `` Honey, I am looking in the closet right now and am not seeing it...'' I shout back. `` I know its in there, its in the brown box.'' The door of the closet moves a little, a rusted hinge squeaks at me, I'm pretty sure that is the damn thing laughing at me, the damn thing is being held up by blasted cardboard boxes. I sigh and carefully get down on my knees. `` If you say so.'' I shout back. I start rooting around the bottom of the closet, trying to remember just how big the camera is and therefore how big the box should be. But of course, my wife's fondness for packing peanuts and bubble wrap most likely eliminates that idea. In the first box is some kind of plastic Native American totem pole knock off bullshit. I think back, it was Rog's, one our trip out to the Grand Canyon when he was five. Little guy just had to have it. I toss it over my shoulder, sending peanuts everywhere and keep digging. Next I open the large box that was directly beneath the totem pole and find another gift from my son, this time from his rebellious years. The box was stuffed with empty bottles of alcohol. `` Hon! We got some dirt on the boy!'' `` What?'' She yells. `` We have some shit to blackmail Roger with now. I just found his stash from high school!'' I shout back, my voice getting hoarse. `` In his sisters room? Are you sure it's not Mary's?'' I smirk, pulling a half full bottle of tequila with a three pack of condoms stuck to the side. `` Pretty sure, Mar never could hold it, remember? You had to hold her hair for three hours after her prom.'' I'll keep the condoms to myself. I hear a `` Humph'' from the other room. She hated thinking of her baby boy doing anything un-angelic, maybe she should finally hear about what I walked in on during his first winter break back from college. I slide the box of alcohol next to me while hoping that Roger's taste in drinks have evolved since his school days."}

I shake my head and continue my slow stroll down the sidewalk. Things just had n't been the same since the outbreak. Although honestly, the outbreak had been as cliche as possible. Started as a weird illness here and there, give it three weeks and people are eating each other like they're all an all-you-can-eat human buffet. They got me about 4 weeks ago. I held out with my two little kids and my beautiful wife when they finally knocked down the door. I took down dozens with my old rifle but eventually they overwhelmed us. I do n't like thinking about that. Honestly the turning was n't bad. No pain, just a warmth, like a blanket on a frosty winter's day. It did n't take me long to realise that I was exceedingly different from the rest of the zombies. Some slight changes to my physical appearance, sure. For one, I was a lot paler now. Hearing your heart not beat is a really weird experience. I had a leg drop off the other week, I wound up sewing it back on and was stunned when the bloody thing actually still worked. I re-adjust the burlap sack hanging from my shoulders. Thank god zombies are strong, otherwise this would be a real pain. Anyway, as I was saying. A lot changed in those first few weeks. I spent most of them trying to get through to my family, hoping something reminiscent of what they used to be was still alive in there. Zip. Nada. Just mindless shufflers like the rest of them. I finally get to the doorstop of my home and shuffle my hand around for my keys. I finally find them at the bottom, sitting next to something strange. I pull it out and am immediately irritated to find myself staring at my pinky finger. Just something else I'll have to sew back on. My keys make a familiar clunk as they turn the pins in the lock, and I swing my door open. I smile as I see my family sitting at the table. Probably not too surprising honestly, considering I tied them to the chairs. I heft the sack off my shoulders and lift the heavy contents. Looks about 24 years old. Somehow amazingly un-turned. No apparent serious injuries. I give him one last dose of the anesthetic I nicked from the hospital, and lay him down on the table. Almost immediately my family starts tearing into him. Thankfully this one does n't wake up. What can I say?"}

Did dad finally get home from his conference? He told you not to wait up, but this was the first time her dad had been gone for that long. He finally felt like you were old enough, which was about time at 16 years old. You would n't admit it to him, but spending the weekend alone can be scary at times. Time to put on some clothes and see him again, you were awake now anyway. You ran downstairs and into the kitchen. This was n't her dad. The guy had an entire black outfit, including some leather, black gloves. His face was covered with scars and he had a creepy moustache. He was around 6 feet tall and had arms as thick as a tree branch. His grin he got on his face when he got aware of your presence was the most scary aspect about him though.'Hello there young girl. All alone here on a Sunday night? I thought I might grab the TV, but a little piece of you would be nice too.' He let out a creepy laugh before charging at you.'What are you-' He grabbed you before you could say anything else. He got a knife from the kitchen board.'Let me help you get out of those.' He let go of his grip for a second and you got loose.'Get off me!' It was useless. He tackled her and this time held a firm grip on her. He used his knife to rip of your pants.'A fighter, I like fighters.' You heard his zipper going down.'Stop! Please, take anything you want, let me go!' You felt fear, anger and something else. He tried to take off the last peices of clothing.'GET OFF ME!' Everything turned into a blur, but you did n't feel any pain. You did n't hear him anymore. The dripping of water was the only thing left you could hear. Everything else was filtered out. You looked at the burned heap of flesh in front of you. A tear fell down your cheek. You could feel the terror in your father's eyes. He looked at you like you were n't his daughter but a threat. It was the same look the burglar gave you right before you realized the sudden surge of power inside of you. The tips of your finger had fire all around them."}

Obama extended his open hand toward Trump expectantly. `` What the hell is this?'' `` My hand,'' Obama answered. `` Shake it. It's customary for every president to do when entering the office. Otherwise, there will always be doubt. There will always be rumors.'' `` Jeez, Barry. If you're this hungry for anything to annoy me, then fine. I'll shake your damn hand.''

As I opened my eyes, I quickly saw\u2026 nothing, as the deep darkness completely owned the room. Pulling my phone out of my pocket and turning on my flashlight app, I grumbled about taking trips to ancient cities and becoming lost in creepy alleyways as stalkers followed you. As the light shined off what appeared to be a massive stone hammer, then a perfectly maintained longsword, I found myself to awed at the ever more apparent array of ancient weaponry on display. \u201c Holy shit, \u201d I whispered, turning in circles, examining a shield so polished it may as well have been a mirror and pausing. I looked\u2026 different. More roughshod than I remembered, my wet brown hair tossed about haphazardly, framing my eyes on one side as the bags underneath them framed them on the other. My lips looked cracked, my nose bloodied, my beard patchy as if I had shaved it in random places at random times. But I didn \u2019 t even have a beard before, I considered apprehensively, before having my attention stolen by a small clank behind me. As I turned and shined my light at the source of the sound, I watched a shadow begin to fall across the opening I had left when I made my way in. I didn \u2019 t have even half a second to consider my next step of action before I saw a long, thin, sickeningly emaciated gray hand reach for the entrance, prompted the door to swing it self shut heavily. Still, I wasn \u2019 t about to stand in place while the unexplained and terrifying happened around me, and I began investigating the weapons present a bit closer. No matter how I looked, the ancient Celtic spears and Roman daggers stained burgundy held no appeal. I hurried down the halls, moving ever further from the entrance, before finally seeing a blade lying forgotten on the stone floor, covered in cobwebs, dust, and surrounded by moss. I wasn \u2019 t sure what it was about this weapon, but it appealed to me more than anything else, and so I slowly made my way over. I reached for the handle and brushed it, recoiling in shock as I felt\u2026 something indescribable slide into my mind. \u201c Ah, finally, \u201d the tendril invading my very thoughts imparted the words on my psyche directly, \u201c someone worthy of wielding me."}

{"id": "writing_1340", "dataset": "writing", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "I'll never forget the day we discovered gravitational waves being emitted from mirrors. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually it *was* yesterday. It took that long to nail down the final confirmation. For months we had been calibrating our detector design, with the eventual aim of observing gravitational radiation from black holes, neutron stars and other celestial bodies. Gravitational wave detectors would open up vast new vistas for astronomy, but the darn things were super-sensitive. We spent months chasing down the tiniest anomaly before we found its source. In the end, the trace was unmistakable in the data. Mirror, mirror on the wall. The implications were enormous: every reflective surface was actually a portal to another dimension. The very word `` reflective'' was a misnomer: photons left our universe and entered another one, and counterpart photons entered ours. Gravitational waves did the same, although they were attenuated by many, many orders of magnitude for some reason as they passed through the interdimensional interface. We're still not sure why. There's a paradox though, which is a bit complicated to explain: our universe would n't exist without symmetry breaking. For example, if matter and antimatter were exact opposites, they would have been produced in equal amounts in the Big Bang, yet there is a tiny disparity, a baryon asymmetry, which has shaped everything around us. Parity violation is another example of symmetry breaking, and that's the problem. It was discovered in 1957 and immediately warranted a Nobel Prize. Parity violation tells us that the mirror dimension must have subtly different physics, in some unknown way. Yet events in the mirror faithfully `` reflect'' -- pun intended -- everything that happens in our dimension. How to explain that contradiction? It was late at night as I stood in the washroom of the research institute. I stared at my counterpart in the mirror. `` How are you different? ``, we said to one another. Obviously, there was no echo. Sound ca n't traverse the portal, since it is a phenomenon of matter, which always remains confined to its own dimension. `` What exists in our world that does n't exist in yours, or vice versa?'' `` We do'', said the voice behind my shoulder, as I stared at an empty room in the mirror. Funny accent, I thought. Transylvanian perhaps."}

Anna smiled consolingly at Mike, she pointed behind him, he turned to see he was in a white room. Or what looked like a room, there were no walls per se, just endless whiteness that had an odd pearlescent quality.

More interesting was the way the first question had changed. `` Yes, you there in the third tier, your hand was up.'' `` Is... Is this... am I in hell?'' His quivering voice and the terror of miscomprehension was spreading among them all as they turned to one another. They always thought they were in or going to hell. `` No, at least not yet.''

My family... where do I even start? After my older brother went off to go and fight, things were quiet for about a week or so. Then, the bombings started. Rebels started showing up in our neighborhood, and many of them were wounded. Bloody, awful wounds, and their screams were so loud. My younger siblings would cover their ears and hide in the corner whenever they heard them, with their ungodly wails. No one ever told us what happened to my brother... but, after two weeks, it did n't even matter. You know what happened. Everyone knows what happened. After they dropped that gas, my family was killed within a matter of hours. Half of the fucking neighborhood. I guess I should be lucky that I got trapped in the basement, under the wreckage of the stairs. But fuck, I could hear them after the ringing in my ears stopped. They were yelling, and then they started making horrible sounds. I did n't find out what it was until they rescued me two days later. A nerve gas, or something. I'm just happy I was n't able to see them. And that they do n't have to suffer anymore. And now I'm here, family is gone, I do n't know where my older brother is, and they gassed us. All of us.

He's trimmed down the back and sides to half an inch from the skin, to reduce the contrast to my thinning crown. He's used sprays, creams, anything to make the remaining follicles darker, give them more volume. And when even his best efforts began to fail, he's shaved my head down to the contours of my scalp, making it seem intentional. Javier's cut my hair for the last eight years, and and in all that time we've never been closer. It feels like a lie, sometimes, the anxiety around him that I mask as fear of going bald. There's his hand on my shoulder, his eyes dark and tender as he leans over me and we plot together, two men seeking to subvert cruel genetics. He's invested himself in me, in my situation, to a degree that I think he would fly from if he understood how I felt about him. I wonder sometimes what he sees when he looks at me. A challenge? A tragedy? The natural limitations of his chosen profession? Or a desperate balding fool, returning to his barber's chair again and again and again in an attempt to pretend that the world is n't falling out from under him. I'm bald this time, picked clean and starkly naked as I walk through his door, busying myself, conspicuously, with a magazine, waiting for him to finish with his current client. He looks up and sees me, raises an eyebrow at my naked scalp, and grins at me in the mirror, signalling at me to wait. I am curiously calm. A stage of our relationship has ended. A new one will begin. `` I was n't expecting you back,'' he teases afterwards, brushing the stray hairs from his chair. He gestures me forwards. `` I tried, Eddie, I tried the best I could.'' He hangs his head melodramatically. `` I figured I failed you.'' `` Never,'' I tell him, easing into the familiar seat, rubbing a hand across my stubble. `` Just a shave. That's all.'' `` You used to shave yourself,'' he remarks, flicking open his straight razor and running across his leather strap. The sound of it scraping across the leather is soothing. Brisk, steady sweeps of the shiny silver blade. It's mesmerizing. `` Yes.'' I can feel my Adam's apple bob as I swallow. There's nothing else to say, nothing that would n't give the game away."}

When the wifi dropped out the adults just went back to using ethernet cables and carried on with their lives, but the kids could n't grasp the concept. `` A wire?'' one had said `` I do n't get it''. I think the loss of internet had lowered their collective IQ around 50 points. The footsteps grew closer `` He must've ran into that warehouse, I have some signal over here!''. I take a deep breath and slide out of my hiding place. I hate how easily they can track me. I make it out the back door just as they enter the front, but they see me go. `` Guys he just went out the back!'' `` Hey my cat picture uploaded!'' Running down a back alley I come to a low fence. Six months ago I would n't have been able to climb it, but after running so long I vault straight over it. I slow to get my breath back and emerge from the other end of the alley. The hoard is there. Maybe 300 kids are staring at me, none of them look older than 17. If you've ever walked down the street, seen some hoodies and felt a bit scared to walk past them... magnify it by a thousand and then arm them all with mobile phones and laptops. None of them move. I'm still breathing heavily. `` He's not running, the wifi signal is dropping out. Get him!'' SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT I make for a gap in the crowd, as they start to mob me, whacking me with their phones to motivate me to run. Oh god. I sprint up the road and the crowd follows me at a jog, uploading selfies of them running, their fitness statistics and tweeting each other a meme about bears. Well at least one thing has come out of this. The childhood obesity epidemic is over."}

I must write this while my heart still beats, i must ensure that someone finds this so that the future can continue. When i was a young man my mentor led me to a great hall near my village, it was a special place, one where young warriors of great potential would be presented with a weapon of great power, one that would help them fulfill their destiny. I passed through the doors of the hall alone, my mentor had told me that he was not worthy of the honour and waited behind. I wandered into the great hall wondering which weapon would choose me I was by far the greatest warrior my village had ever produced. I had bested every oponent i ever faced and could outwit even the smartest foe. I was on my way to becomming a great general. I knew i was worthy of only the greatest weapon. I passed excalibur and mjolnir, fine weapons indeed but weapons of royalty. Even though i knew i was worthy of such finely crafted items i also viewed them with a certain amount of disdain. These were the weapons of oppressors, people who ruled but didnt care much for the people they ruled. I wouldve been greatly disappointed had i been chosen by such a weapon. Thankfully it was not meant to be. I passed many other finely crafted weapons, all adorned with rare metals and precious gems, each one more beautiful and fearsom than the last, but none called to me. I had just about finished exploring the hall and was going to give up, perhaps i would not recieve my weapon, perhaps i was not destined to be a great general as i had thought. Then suddenly i heard my name being called. I followed the voice. The mysterious voice led me past all the weapons, past the swords and hammers, the axes and bat'leths. It led me to a table situated at the end of the hall. I looked upon the table and saw..... nothing! No sabres, no daggers, not even a tiny little arrowhead. All that was on the table was a feather, surely this feather wasnt the object calling me. I picked it up and examined it, this is when i realised that this was no feather, it was a quill. A fine quill at that, but a quill nonetheless. I was not even sure what such an item was doing in this hall. It made no sense to me. Then it spoke! `` The pen is mightier than the sword!"}
{"id": "writing_3265", "dataset": "writing", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "I lived in a two bedroom apartment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with my roommate, Lucifer, Son of the Morning. The rent was eight hundred and fifty dollars a month, which included electricity and water, but not cable television or internet access. We had an in-suite dishwasher. Four washing machines and four clothes dryers were located in a room down the hall for communal use by all the tenants on our floor. I did not know Lucifer before he moved in. We met due to an advertisement I placed on Craigslist. My former roommate, Brian Petersen, had been offered a promotion, which required him to relocate to Dallas, Texas. Brian had been a good roommate. He was tidy and rarely noisy. Sometimes we would play PS4 together in the living room. A couple times a week, we would order a pizza or Chinese food and split the cost right down the middle. His rent check was always on time and his girlfriend Roberta once introduced me to her friend Sandra, who was kind and beautiful, even though we did not have a natural connection to each other. When Brian moved to Dallas, I placed an ad on Craigslist for a new roommate. Lucifer, Son of the Morning, was the only person to respond. When he came for the interview, I was surprised to find out that he was Middle Eastern and also an older gentleman. There are not many Middle Easterners who immigrate to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and certainly not in their sunset years. However, I needed someone to assume Brian's share of the rent and, other than his age and heritage, Lucifer seemed to be a quiet and dependable person. After a brief tour, I explained the apartment complex by-laws, including the regulations concerning pets, noise after ten at night, and reservation of the courtyard gazebo and barbecue. Lucifer smiled and signed on the spot a sublease I had prepared in advance. On the day he moved in, Lucifer immediately began to seek concessions to suit his comfort. He demanded that we replace the blinds with thick, red, velvet curtains, even though the blinds were fixtures belonging to the apartment complex itself. He asked that I move my fifty inch LED TV into my bedroom, even though the bedroom was not a large enough space for a screen of that dimension. I objected to his requests, saying they were unreasonable, and I got heated when Lucifer ignored me and began unplugging the cables behind my TV without my permission."}

The 36-year-old made headlines two years ago when she became the youngest SpaceX employee to be promoted to Colonial Commissioner. Now she is in charge of operations at The Jovian System, and currently finds herself in low-orbit around Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter. She gave an irate sigh at this exacerbated question. Having just informed Director Musk, the most powerful man in the solar system, of intelligent radio communication on what was supposed to be an uninhabited system, she expected more than this reply. `` A 38 minute delay in communication and this is all he has to say... Fuck's sake, he probably thinks the team is picking up its own ground scanning signals. How incompetent does he believe us to be?'' Mark, one of the pilots of the mission and the only other person on-board the orbiter, kept his intense focus on his work. `` Probably just as shocked as we are,'' he said as he ruled out the use of modulation techniques on the signal. He was confident he could decipher the radio clicks quicker than the team of experts back on Earth. Besides, he had a head start, and they still had to relay their findings across vast amounts of space. `` The Galileo project showed habitable conditions, and JUICE proved definitively that no life was on the surface. We're all just trying to figure out what the hell is going on.'' A screen in front of Mark showed the constant and unmistakably intelligent signal, as received by the team on the surface and relayed back to them where they were hovering in geostationary orbit. The signal varied in amplitude, frequency, and phase, but there was clear no methodology behind this. The only controlled variable seemed to be the length of the pulses and the length of the gaps between pulses. Almost like an advanced Morse code, Mark thought to himself, just utilising a larger variable set. `` Ania,'' he kept scribbling on his note pad, `` the manner in which this code varies... It's not modulation. There's no structure, no pattern.'' He looked up at her, `` I think it's organic.'' `` You mean someone, *something*, is speaking to us in electromagnetic waves?'' She glanced at the Earth-link again, hoping for something more, something she can act on. `` Well it's certainly not like anyth...'' Mark broke off. He dashed down a rough table on a clean slate of paper, feverishly inserting values. `` Oh, God. They're using our UPC encoding.'' There was no excitement at having solved the riddle."}

I think about you all the time, everywhere, over and over again. I keep thinking about our first time meeting in the park. You were feeding the ducks, and I was just sitting on the bench, a little away. I remember the longing look we exchanged when the ducks suddenly took flight, and when their feathers settled around you, you... You looked like an angel.'' She was shaking all over like a puppy. Oh, she must be glowing with happiness! He took both her hands and cradled them like a treasure. `` That's the real reason why I visited you; when I found your wallet in the park, I honestly fought with myself whether or not I should just give it to you, like a good friend should, or if I should tell you my true feelings.

The picture just did n't fit. He stepped inside and was greeted by his partner. `` Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?'' `` We found a female body bound in duct tape.

In his bodily form, Nat lived and died many years before Ted. Natson Henry Copper, was his name. He was born English and his voice still held that distinct Londoner accent hammered in by years of leisurely living, sprinkled with raucous events, that gave flavor to his tone and expression. In heaven, Natson was Ted's guide. Veterans of the afterlife were always assigned to new arrivals until they understood the new world around them.

It called out to me, it told me to turn around. I froze. This was the most terrifying thing I had ever experienced. But I did listen to it and as I turned around I saw a shadow figure standing there, in the dark. Clapping my hands to shed more light on it did n't help. It was still completely dark, you could only make out it's shape, which was creepily humanoid. It did n't talk. It *thought* directly into my head. So, telepathy. It told me my roomate was a serial killer and that he was a demon from the netherworld, here to take his soul, and therefore kill him, as I understood it, and take him back into the dark lands. Now this scared me. I immediately thought of the numerous bad things I had done myself in my life, certainly I had n't killed anyone, but still, if hell, or whatever this being purported to come from, was real, then... But, wait. Could it listen to my thoughts? This was maddening. Perhaps I had went mad. I threw a glass of water at it and ran outside. It did n't go after me. Curiously enough, I collapsed and lost my consciousness just as I was trying to leave the premises. I woke up back in my room, the dark figure sitting beside me, on my own bed. Now this was really creepy, but so far it had n't been violent with me, so I decided to keep my cool and find out what it wanted. I decided to speak to it. `` Can you hear my thoughts?'' `` No, human, I can only speak to you this way. Your thoughts are your own.'' It *did* speak to me. It spoke to my mind. It did n't make a noise. It spoke to me internally, with a different voice than my own, one I could n't control. Now, I had clearly gone mad, but what was I supposed to do? `` Why do you want my roommate? Am I in trouble as well?'' `` No. I am here to collect his soul, once he dies. But I ca n't kill him. What I can do is persuade someone else to do it for me. Are you in?'' What the heck, why not. `` Yes, I'm in."}

We're here to help you --'' The smell hits me first. She smiles and opens the door wide. The stench is more than I can bear. I take a hesitant step inside. Garbage is everywhere. Papers stacked almost to the ceiling. Flies circle around something that probably used to be fruit. A cat darts past us and out the door. I look to my left. Large boxes filled with old food drip liquid, which runs in a river-like way to the floor. She motions for me to follow, and in my shock I comply. We reach the back bedroom, after having climbed over a mountain of old magazines. She points into the room. I step inside, and immediately vomit in a bucket at my feet. The corpse of a man lies in the bed. By the looks of him, it's been a while. She comes up behind me and places a gentle hand on my shoulder. I look at her, and she smiles. `` Let's not wake Harold,'' she says. `` But please tell me you're here to do something about the dust.''"}

The sheriff exclaimed. `` He stands accused of robbery, burglary, lewd behavior...'' He proceeded to list the rest of the prisoner's crimes. I stood silent at my post, ax in hand. I'd sharpened it that morning. I had the honor to be the king's justice for fifteen long years, and in all that time I had never once allowed a soul to suffer through its passing. `` What I took was ill-gained,'' Robin said to himself, kneeling beside me. `` I kept nothing for myself, in any case. I gave all to those who needed it. I did what I did with the best intentions.'' `` That is the cause of many a man's actions,'' I offered, under the sheriff's droning. `` But what you gave was not yours to give.'' `` It was not the king's brother's to take.'' He countered. His eyes scanned the crowd. `` Fair enough, but you must know your place in the world. And perform your duty.'' `` My place is with the people of Sherwood,'' he said, shifting his weight. `` My duty is to them. I must see they are fed, sheltered, cared for. John would leave them nothing. And for what, some lands in France not even he will set eyes on? A ruler must answer to his people first, not his coffers.'' It was a fair point. `` Do you have family in the village?'' he asked. `` Yes.'' `` How do they fare?'' `` They get by,'' I said. `` I send what I can, but away from the king's ear no one would dispute our taxes are harsh. Still, they are left enough grain to get by.'' `` Get by, or avoid starvation? I've seen what they are left. We've had a bountiful harvest these last few years, yet the people can only get by.'' The sheriff was beseeching the Lord to judge Robin justly, though his heart did n't appear to be in it. `` You do offer my family a certain amount of hope.'' I confessed. `` Do I? I thank you, sir.'' `` And I am sorry to take yours away. They will not come.'' `` Excuse me?'' `` Your men have been detained,'' I explained. He saw that it was true. `` You suppose none of the downtrodden will step forward to rescue their captive hero? Imagine the stories they can tell, in the autumn of their years!'' `` Heroes always live in the stories,'' I said, glancing at him. `` Yes, they do.'' He replied, flashing a knowing smile. `` They are just people out there,'' I said."}

It had been ten days since they crossed into the Black Side and three since they dropped off the kid, and the crew was on edge. It had been 10 years since anyone had attempted an expedition to the Dark Continent, and they always ended the same. Sailors would land on the eerily hot sand, collect plant samples, and dig some holes and pan rivers for precious metals or gems ( *never* finding a damn thing ). But it was only a matter of time before the natives came and attacked everyone. `` Attack *the torch carriers*'', Sir William had said when Norris first tried to talk him out of this crazy mission. `` They always first attack sources of fire. I wo n't be needing a torch, so I wo n't have that problem.'' Norris had chuckled. He felt bad for the kid. Sir William Mason, at age 16, was the oldest person that had ever lived with Sun Sickness. His affliction was an incredibly common one that affected roughly one in ten newborns. Their weird little eyes ( if you could even call them that ) were incredibly sensitive to light and their skin blistered almost immediately in the sun. No amount of clothing or covers seemed to be completely effective at blocking the sun's effects, and children rarely lived to see their second birthday. It had become common practice to kill newborns with Sun Sickness to spare them from their few years of pain, and the High Priest had even endorsed this as a form of mercy. But William's parents could not bear to kill their firstborn and resolved to find a way to allow him to live comfortably. They had a wing of their mansion completely sealed from the sun and hired blind servants and tutors to raise the boy in his own little world. When the time came to train him how to get around in the dark, everyone was amazed that he had completely perfect night vision. He grew up comfortable, but restless. `` I was living in a five-room prison when there was a whole half a planet devoid of sun,'' William had said through the little communication slit of his box ( the oddest piece of cargo Norris had ever hauled ). `` The Dark Continent is where I belong. I'm sure of it. What if the natives are just like me? The last sailor to see one described their eyes as like those of someone with Sun Sickness.'' `` That was a terrified deckhand that caught a *glimpse* of a savage's face in near total darkness as he was high-tailing it to the shore,'' said Norris."}

Honestly, David? Is this what you're stooping to? Look at it. /u/Future-Starter's clearly pandering to you -- baiting you into writing a hideous abomination of self-referencing, self-reference-referencing blather. And the sad part is, you're going along with it. Really, now, I thought you were better than this. The truth is that there are plenty of other prompts that are more deserving of your attention than this. How about this one? `` [ A world where eating people is perfectly normal and legal, but eating animals is the most vile and disgusting and illegal thing a person could do. ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20tou7/wp_a_world_where_eating_people_is_perfectly/ )'' In fact, you already have a character that could work well here, and you've never had the opportunity to use her before. Remember the blonde, bespectacled, necrophilic coroner that you came up with nearly a year ago? You could hint at her proclivities by stating that she `` likes to play with her food.'' Hmm, what was her name? Maybe this could do? A phrase prompt: [ `` At my third birthday party the cake only had two candles. `` ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20u9sx/wp_at_my_third_birthday_party_the_cake_only_had/ ) You could easily write some sort of changeling story, of a fantasy or a sci-fi bent. You could do a story about a time-distorted world, where the protagonist ages normally but celebrates his birthdays out of order for some reason. This prompt has plenty of possibilities to it that /u/Future-Starter's little meta-prompt does not. Oh! I just saw a *really* good one! Another phrase prompt: [ `` Can I buy just one bullet? `` ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20rudv/wp_can_i_buy_just_one_bullet/ ) Is it a suicide? A murder? A frame-up, perhaps? Aha! Maybe the protagonist is searching for a *specific* bullet! Her partner shot her with a real bullet as part of a ruse that threatened, but ultimately saved, her life, at the price of her partner's! She lives in a society where bullets removed from bodies are resold and melted down as scrap metal, and she wants to buy the bullet that was removed from her body, to keep it as a memento of her partner's life! Well, yes, Cobbie, I'll admit that that's a bit far-fetched, but so many great stories are! Take a risk! Crawl out of your tiny little shell!

Really though, I'd bought this collection for just one thing. Rooting around near the bottom I plucked out a near perfect condition cassette recorder. Panasonic, expensive back in it's day. `` If you were n't so obsessed with the past, maybe we'd still have a future!'' Ugh, what a drama queen. Did she realise how cliche that sounded? Her words bounced around my head nonetheless, unwelcome amongst the childhood sentiments that had already risen up. *Obsession. * Her fucking cats were an obsession, this was a hobby. If she'd spent less time doting on Anna Marie and Clancy Fluffleback she might know the difference. I inspected the blank tapes, all C46's. Four tapes, 8 sides, so... about 3 hours of recording time. Not bad. More than enough to have some fun with. It seemed like a lifetime since I'd spent my days recording news reports, complete with ad breaks in between. In some ways I guess it was. Unfortunately, reality kicked in somewhere around 99 and my nasal voice proved unsuitable for broadcast of any kind. I had ended up studying journalism instead, which was sort of the same thing. Sort of. I slotted in the first tape as I cast my mind back to my youth. Dougie Phelps? No, definitely not. Erm, Daniel Fields? Closer, but still no. Donald Franks, that was it! Man of the people, hero of the airwaves. I hit record and to my relief the little red light beamed back at me. I took a breath and prepared to slip back inside Donnie's shoes. `` Good afternoon folks, remember to tune in weeknights at 7 sharp for the'News In Frank' with me, your host, Donald Frank.'' I hit stop and wound the tape back. That felt weird, really weird. I'd almost forgotten how much I'd wanted to be this guy when I was younger. As an adult, I wanted to be him even more. The tape machine clunked to a halt and I hovered my finger over the play button."}

It was so quiet that you could her the dog barking outside. `` It'll be something that I do n't think I can handle.'' he said while leaning forward and smiling. His wife blushed and giggled as she could sorta make out the dog barking outside. `` Did you like what I cooked for you?'' she asked in a chipper voice. `` Oh! I have n't tried it yet.'' he responded. He took some of the spaghetti and clamped his mouth on it. He shuddered. They both stared at each other. `` Oh! I have n't tried it yet.'' he responded. He looked at the spaghetti in a grim fashion, and clamped his mouth on it. He was surprised to find that the spaghetti was much better this time around. `` wha....uh....I did n't expect this to be so good.'' he said. `` Yeah well I made sure to put a lot of salt on it thi.....yeah.'' she said. Before he could wonder how it was suddenly good, he heard a familiar cry. The baby. `` Ugh....this is why you should have used a better condom, Johnny.'' `` What?'' heard Johnny. `` I think Tina's hungry, Ashley.'' said Johnny mere seconds before he heard the baby start crying. She admired how attentive a father Johnny was before walking with him upstairs. Once they got to the crib, they smelled that it was not hunger that was Tina's problem. `` Change him, John.'' `` Why do I have to? I do n't wan na do that even if I go b....You're better at it than me anyway!'' `` Well you would get better at it if you tried! And why did you pause then? You keep pausing in the middle of sentences around me like you're hiding something from me!!'' Tina stared at her parents. `` You prepared for the hot date tonight, Ash?'' `` You know it John. I hope you do n't mind that its at home tonight."}

And I liked the color. Plus it was my size and that never happens. I also found a pretty sweet road bike but it was too expensive. And it was n't my size anyway. The sweater was like a teal green. A full zip hoody. It was more sage colored now. And it currently has a handgun in the left pocket. It's not mine. I normally make a habit out of putting everything I need in that pocket. Then before I leave my apartment, I distribute my items to other pockets appropriately. Keys in right, phone in left jeans, lighter in my right jeans, wallet in back right, my cigarette case in my back left. It's systematic, and I've been doing it since middle school. So when I started wearing the sweater I started getting things mixed up. I'd reach for my cigarettes, and they would n't be there. But I'd find my lighter and my cigs in the pocket. `` Whaaaaaat? Crazy.'' That's how it started. By the next summer I could n't go anywhere without the sweater. I thought it was lucky. One time I locked myself out of my house. I peeked and saw my keys on the table through my window. I had to climb up to my bedroom window and crawl in. And then when I put them in the pocket I already have my door key there. It was n't on my key ring. It was already in the pocket. `` Damn, when did I do that?'' Like magic. This other time I was downtown and lost my wallet in a bar somewhere. And when I tried to enter my favorite bar, my ID was in the pocket. And when I explained to my friends I could n't buy drinks cuz I was broke i found a fresh fifty in the pocket. `` How? I do n't know. Get me a beer. This is messing me up man.'' It was a good thing too, I totes ended up going home with someone. And we end up dating for like six months. That night I find one my condoms from home in the pocket. Like RIGHT when I needed it. It started get bad though. If I did n't have the sweater, I'd get home and find all my stuff in the pocket. I thought my girlfriend was pranking me. So I confront her, right? `` Hey, we got ta talk...'' BAM. She was cheating on me. I did n't even ask about the pocket."}

Shifting uncomfortable in his seat the man responded quietly. `` We're dropping our support, Rory. I'm sorry, we have no choice.'' He looked away, a few tears coming to his own eyes.

Her son's father, Chuck, had committed suicide just a few short years ago. Since then, she has noticed that her son has become increasingly distant. Raymond was your typical average student. Average grades. Not particularly good at any sports. He had friends but did n't hang out with them that often. After Chuck has passed away, Carol knew she needed to up her efforts a little bit. Though, whenever she thought she was making progress, Raymond became even more distant. It got to the point where Ray would not even talk to his own mother. One evening, while riding home from school with some friends, Raymond died in a car accident. Only one of the teens survived. His name is Derek. After another lengthy period of grief, Carol decided to take the next step. She called up Ray's friend Derek. They offered each other condolences and pleasantries. Then she asked Derek how Ray had been, emotionally, before the accident. At first Derek did not know how to respond to such a straightforward question. But he was honest. He said that Ray had been behaving normally, given his circumstances. They chatted some more and then Carol thanked him for his time and asked him if she could call again. Over time, Carol and Derek formed a sort of friendship. They would chat over the phone about Raymond. Occasionally, Derek would stop over to visit with Carol. Carol appreciated Derek's visits but she was still emotionally scarred. She knew she needed to talk to a professional. Before she called the shrink, she decided have one more visit with Derek. Derek stopped by her house and sat down with Carol. She put her head in her hands and really opened up. She told him that she was going to seek professional help. As she held back her tears, it was at that point that she knew that it was not her son, but rather herself, that was distant. As she went to apologize to Derek, she took a deep breath and looked up. No one else was there. It was just her. All alone."}

The Commander signaled his gunner to target the Pampillian Fighter. `` Are you insane? We're the protectors of this planet.''

The General commanded, watching the viewer as his commands were carried out. A moment later he watched as each of the torpedos exploded. The image fo the star fighter flickered, but more interesting than that, a faint flicker of light appeared off to the right. `` What was that?'' `` Displacer Cloaking Technology. We ca n't see them, General. Whereever they appear, the real ship will be close, but never where we see it.'' The gunner explained. `` Then target the area around the displacement.'' The General snapped as another blast from the rail gun pecked away at his shields. `` As you command, sir.'' A barrage of torpedos blasted forth from their launching tubes, speeding into the blackness of space around the image of the fighter. Plasma fire appeared out of nowhere taking out one of the torpedos. `` Target that quadrant.'' The General commanded, pointing toward the area where the plasma fire had originated."}

Notes and books and binders and it was everywhere, with only a small path from my desk to the door. It had taken months of research and digging to get to this point. I had started this back in late April. It was just amusing... until i realized it wasnt a typo. In 1989 there was a radical shortage of fire-related deaths. Housefires and arson and wildfires yes, but no *deaths*. How? And why only in Washington? Nobody else had even noticed the phenomena. Anybody remotely interested would have considered it merely `` a good year.'' I was alone I didnt know where to begin so i looked up articles online. After that i went to dozens of small towns across the state looking into newpaper articles that were too mundane to be backed up onto computer. Those too were on the floor. I was searching for any evidence on fires. And i didnt find much. If anything, the decrease was even higher. A few deaths i did find could be contributed to other factors. `` Murdered before the fire.'' `` Heart attack and left the stove on.'' The one that stood out was `` Death in. burn ward after surgery complications'', but that was because the patient had preexisting injuries. No other states had a similar occurance. As far as i could tell, no other countries did either. Those were all dead ends. I had plunged into near insanity, chasing an answer that neither existed nor quenched my obsession. Every idea or scrap of information led me to look in another direction, leading me further and further away from closure. But then something occured to me. I kicked over the paper stacks as i made my way over to my file cabinet.I grabbed the bottom steel handle and pulled the heavy bottom drawer out. In my this drawer i had cataloged all the fire-related deaths i could find in 1988, 1989, and 1990. Nowhere else on earth had as comprehensive a list as this. thumbed through the stack and pulled out two folders. I went through the first folder. The last fire-related death in'88 was a schoolteacher from Yelm named *Joey Phillips. * Age 45. He had been found New Years day, burned alive the night before. According to the article the police were looking into it, i doubt they ever found much. I went through the second folder and pulled out another sheet.

I asked. `` The building of Vayus was not without action if it is boredom you are so worried about,'' he explained patiently. `` The hill tribes killed many young men and violated countless young women before our forefathers drove them back into the mountains.''

They never recovered Sir Arvan's mighty sword.'' the old man droned on and I perked to attention, scowling for having missed the first part of the story. `` Some say Nature claimed it as her own and that it is at the core of the largest tree in the Dark Forest. Others say it is at the top of the tallest mountain, sitting in the first place the sun shines each morning and the last place it shines each night.'' `` Why is this sword so special?''

Above the asian restaurant a dim sign shone the name'Fu's Asian Cuisine.' The name swayed sullenly in the wind as the lights in the name flickered. The faint screaming of a car horn shook him from his stupor. Looking behind himself, he saw the deserted parking lot cast in shadows as the sun rose from the east. The door opened easily as he stepped inside. The buzzing of the refrigerator left him forgetting this outside world as the window shades drew down of their own accord. An asian man appeared behind the cash register having just came from the kitchen. His apron had the stains of a lunch rush yet the chairs sat lonely. He slowly stepped up the man. Behind the cash register, his eyes sat blank, sunk into his skull. Clearing his throat he said, `` I'll have an eggroll.'' The mans head swiveled towards him. Laying the cash onto the table, he quickly picked a seat hidden from the man's sight. His fingers danced along the table as his food was being prepared. The squeaking of knobs turning interrupted his dance as he listened closer. The pattering of multiple feet could be heard and the slight murmuring of a foreign words. The man brought the eggroll out on a plate, its edges stained a slightly brown color. The man placed a fortune cookie next to his plate mechanically and turned. Walking away, he saw a knife sticking out of the back of the man's pants. Turning his attention to his meal, he gingerly picked up the egg roll and sniffed it warily. Taking a bite, a slimy texture slithered through his mouth. Spitting it out quickly, he uncapped the lid of his flask around his neck. Taking a deep swig, he looked down at what he had spit out. Black speckles paraded the burnt meat and hints of yellow could be seen through its translucent shell. Turned off, he ate his fortune cookie. Inside sat a tiny roll of paper. Unrolling it slowly, his eyes moved along its edges. Sighing in exasperation, he ate the cookie quickly and went to the door. Pulling on the handle, he became aware of something behind him. Turning from the unbudging door, he jumped at the sight of the worker directly behind him. His eyes danced in flame, turning the color of a fire. Turning quickly around, he pulled once more that seemed glued shut. Freezing his muscles, he looked through the glass door to see the once fiery sky of dawn turned blood red in the flames of consuming chaos."}

My finger pulsed quickly with the heartbeat of the woman -- Linda -- sitting across from me. A woman I had not met until today. I glanced at the gold and black ring, remembering seeing it online years ago and buying it for my wife and I. A way to always be reminded of each other. A way to always feel the other's fast beating heart when we stared into each other's eyes. A way to feel each other's heart when we were a thousand miles away. But one day, ten years ago, the pulsing stopped. She had worn it throughout the treatment. I kept it on as well, even as her spikes and dips agonized me. Even as her heart slowed and my eyes filled with tears and the pulse I had become so used to disappeared. She had willed her ring to her sister, Ally. That tore me up. I wanted to keep that symbol of our love with me, near and dear to my heart. I had even asked Ally about it. But she refused, telling me it's what my wife had wanted. That I should respect my wife's last wishes. It did n't matter to me. I kept after her, trying to get the ring back. Trying to hold onto something from the past. And Ally kept refusing me, until she would n't talk to me anymore. Until I stopped even getting a Christmas card from her and Kyle. So all I had left was my ring. My ring that had n't pulsed in a decade. Until -- `` So, how did you get that ring?'' I asked. She took a tentative sip of the steaming tea she had set for the two of us. Her green eyes leveled with mine. `` My aunt gave it to me. And she got it from a friend, who got it from someone in her book club. And so the story goes.'' `` And the box was sealed until you got it?'' I was a bit incredulous that a sealed box had made its way around Seattle for the last ten years and no one had bothered to even look inside. `` Yeah,'' she nodded. `` My Aunt said she never thought it was meant to be opened. She just thought it was a nicely carved trinket.'' Linda picked up the lacquered rosewood box. `` And to be honest, I forgot about it for the past few years until I was cleaning out the office.''

There were plenty of digital slums now and this was the worst of them. The residents were allocated the very lowest amount of bandwidth to keep'living' - and as a result, everything was in drab greyscale. Sometimes even plain white and black when resources were especially low. Distance was filtered too - you could n't see more than a few cubic meters around you, so you were constantly running into the other digital homeless, trudging through the slums, bouncing off their collision barriers like a primitive game of pinball. Although, it was n't like there was much to look at on the street. Everything was plain, uniform and low-quality. Doors did n't even open and close; they just disappeared and appeared - where there *were* doors. Disaffected people had scrawled graffiti on the walls by forcing impacts to occur between indestructible digital objects, leaving a trail of jumbled code and scrambled textures to form words. But even the digital graffiti would eventually revert back, fading until the walls were uniform and grey again. Once we had all been living in a burgeoning digital utopia, free to fly, create, destroy and play. I only knew this because the other greyscale, nearly featureless denizens of the slum told me so in thier dreary, personality-free monotone voices. I was born inside the digital world, just before things went bad. My parents had carefully coded me from their own digital'essence' and I had sprung into this world with a fully functional mind, but with the knowledge of a newborn. There was no way to determine how old I was in biological years because time did n't work the same here as in the'real' world. Or so I had been told. All I knew was that my'real world' uptime was twenty three thousand, four hundred and thirty seven hours - and I'd only spent fifteen of those hours living in relative luxury before the degradation had started. One rumour was that something had gone wrong in the'real' world and that was why the slums had sprung up - there were no longer enough resources free to allow everyone to live in a perfect world; so only the wealthy people and the valuable people got the best resources allocated and lived in an infinite reality of super-high definition. The other rumour I believed was that the rich had simply taken so much and were so selfish that there was n't enough left for the poor and the broken."}

I no longer cried for the ones who fell, the ones whose lifeless corpses got dragged off by the darkly dressed observers. I was lost in the routine of running. The dusty circle was all I knew. The scalding sun was my nemesis, the midnight moon my imaginary friend. In this place, the cooling relief of night did not seem to exist. Darkness was an unknown agent to me, a hazy memory of earlier days, when the soft touch of others existed and my legs did n't burn and my tongue did n't swell and my throat did n't clench and my feet were n't bloody and when I actually had a purpose, when I could talk, when I could walk, not bloody run. Running. I had no idea how long I had been doing it for. No idea how long I'd gone without food or water. No idea why the sun had never set. Ideas were something I did n't have much of. There was but one idea in my mind. An idea imprinted upon me by the faceless voices that had put me and everybody else inside this sweltering circle. The idea of nothing. The notion that it would all end, that there would be nothing left. The fear of finality, of closure was petrifying. So I ran. Ran and ran and ran. The others kept falling and falling, and the bystanders methodically dragged them away, leaving long, jagged trails in the sand. Eventually, it was just me. Just me, trampling the bloody sand into clots. My legs were on fire, seemingly hotter than the sun itself. My eyes were dry, filled with sand, making blinking torture. Suddenly, my face was in the sweltering sand, grains digging into my exposed pores. I had stopped. The fear took over. Frantically scrambling, I tried using my useless arms to push myself up. I had to keep running. It was no use. I fell onto my scabbed back. The last thing I remember was the sky. It had turned black."}

The Bible? Of course. The Quran? Sure. I even read The Book of Mormon. The best stuff that I could find on God coming to earth though came from the Gospels. As I started to read those, I could n't keep myself from laughing. I finally understood what the hell everybody was doing going to all these random places looking for Mr. Almighty. A bunch of them would go to churches and temples which is obvious. Others would go to soup kitchens, half-way houses, brothels, courts and philosophy seminars. These were a bit better. The ones that killed me though were the guys that were going by the docks asking if any of the local fishermen had mysteriously up and quit in the last couple of weeks. What? Do these people think that God has no creativity? There is no way He's going to do the same old thing the second time around. None of these theories, even the good ones, did it for me though. I was thinking way smaller. I have spent the last few weeks hanging out in cheap diners. The more unambiguous the better. Every one that I could find I would spend a week in going back every day.

As I opened it, my father came to the door and peered into the box. He patted me on the back and laughed `` Well you did want a Dragon''. I looked back at the creature in front of me and bent down to touch it. A giant Lizard is still pretty awesome. - I'm not a good writer at all, this is super disjointed and does n't flow well, but I wanted to get the idea out."}

SK scanned ahead, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It always did with Halo, but her performance made up for the talking. Her body also helped, a trim model put out by a private engineer, its performance and shape tuned to perfection. A call came down the pipe for wet-work, and after checking the regular channels, he took it. Some slag over in the Red Light District had found himself on the wrong side of someone with power -- a death sentence ticking down to a hammer click and muzzle flash. Standard contract rules applied, so the job would get done, even if it took him several tries to do it right. `` The job, I get. It's the only way to make cash down here. But why go full droid when you did n't have to?'' She'd brought it up before, a pretext to talking about herself. If he were n't certain of her capabilities, the barrage of questions would make him wonder if she were afraid. Fear on the job got you killed, and SK planned on living a long, prosperous life. Coming down to this part of town meant dealing with the garish nature of a three-square mile mausoleum of vice. Neon and holos crawled across the exposed metallic flesh of every bar, whorehouse, and drug den. Each place belted out their specialties in hopes of starving out competition, even though good escorts would n't dare run down here. The verbal brawl and detached crowds made for perfect cover; no one wanted to find themselves on the wrong side of a barrel over a misunderstanding. `` We each have our reasons, let's leave it at that.'' Flexing a hand, SK let his aiming scripts run in the background while he brought building layouts and the target's info up on his visor. The guy was a low-level pusher, his main product a variant of speed put on the market after years of military use. It was good shit, the kind he'd use if he still had a body to feel the high. But that was the past. `` No, seriously, I want to know. Why'd you do it?'' Lowering her hood, Halo winced a smile, the chrome of her face curving as though it were flesh. It was crazy what engineering could accomplish these days, even if the distinction between meat and metal was clear as ice. The building was a old bar, shut down thanks to bad location and a few unfortunate brawls."}

The unmistakable feeling of humanity swirled around me in a phantasmagoria of flesh. The clutch of sweat and noise. Men and women waltzed around to electronic tones; swerving, pulsating, mutating bass flooded the room. Lights revealed sides of people that not even they knew, and in a second, it was gone. The room was tilted and spinning, like one of those mazes with the metal ball. *What was in this drink? * I looked deep into the red cup. *Or was it blue? * I could n't tell in the morphing carousel of movement. I swished it around for a second, to get a better idea of what exactly was in it. Surely this was what was warping my world in such a way. Come to think of it, the bunny-rabbit girl had given it to me. She grinned and handed me the drink. `` What's in it?'' `` Blood.'' `` Blood?'' I took a sip. It clearly was n't blood. `` Good one,'' I murmured, looking up for her as she sank into the pulsing crowd of people. And now, I was standing here alone. Hand against the wall, as it grew furry and enveloped my hand. The eyes of the partygoers started to glow a fierce green. They all had begun looking at me. Why? What had I done? I was just watching. Standing on the wall with my peculiar drink and watching. The music forced me deeper into the wall; the slurping low tones were gently pushing me forward. The partygoers had all stopped dancing. The churning lights still mutated their faces into grotesque phantasms of themselves. They had stopped moving. Hands at their sides, their ever-changing faces peered at me with dead, green eyes. The bass urged me deeper and deeper into the plush walls, as it came over my shoulder. I still held the curious drink in front of me, and as the wall sucked me further back into the embrace of what was concrete a few minutes ago, I felt an unmistakable calm. The wall came over my ears and the sleepy roll of the music sunk into me. My arm was still outstretched as to keep the empty faces of the other revelers at bay - `` Look, I've got a drink.'' It was warm inside the wall, and I let it take me. I took one last sip from the drink, my very last one, and the wall encompassed my head. I was nearly part of the wall, drink in my hand when the Bunny Rabbit emerged from the crowd and smashed the bottom of the cup back towards my head."}

But Alan had heard the story so many times that he could practically tell every word Martin was going to say before he even said it. `` All the kid wanted was for his music to be heard. He just wanted people to stop and listen to him. I should've known it would get to his head, but I granted it anyway. I had to, after all.'' Martin stopped the story to take a sip from his drink, forgetting that he had spilt it. No matter how drunk he got, Martin always sounded stone-cold sober whenever he told this story. `` Martin, you do n't have to tell this story a-'' Alan tried to comfort Martin but found himself being ignored as Martin opened his mouth to speak again. `` He was a sweet kid, he really was. His voice was n't half-bad either. But all the women, all the drugs, it just... it just got to him. Why did n't I try to protect him? Why did n't I warn him?''

Mr Morris, the science teacher who had drawn the short straw this year and been forced to organise the science fair, slowly began to realise why his colleagues had all smirked when he had told them he was allocating tables alphabetically. With a flourish, Mr Mitchell removed the sheet that had been covering their project - an exact working replica of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano and turn glared across at the Mifflins and their Mount Etna reproduction. Icy looks passed between the two fathers and the children peeked out from behinds their legs. David poking out his tongue. Mr Mitchell fussed around, setting up the replica while Mr Mifflin suddenly found reason to recheck the placement of the 42 scale trees he had carefully created from scratch. The checking continued frantically, each father slapping away his child's attempts to help, right up until the judges arrived at their tables. The lead judge was, as always, Dr Smith, the schools head teacher but this year he had with him a guest judge - Michelle Wallis, a local Chemist who had joined the PTA and whose own daughter was just a few years from her first competition. Mr Mortis trailed behind them. `` Well well, what a fine pair of volcanos!'' Dr Smith's voice boomed out. `` Say, it might be fun to judge them together?'' He turned to his fellow judge but then nodded before she could reply `` Excellent, let's begin!'' Both fathers jumped forward and began to speak and Dr Smith had to wave them silent. `` One at a time I think!'' He pointed to Mr Mifflin `` you first I think.'' With some smugness Mr Mifflin began. `` I present to you a complete scale model of Mount Etna, the *best known* of all the volcanos.'' Mr Mitchell snorted. `` Here you see we have created the surrounds and scale models of local villages. Of course this model is designed to show the incredible power of the earth and the frightening force of nature.'' Dr Smith interrupted. `` Very good, let's see it work then.'' Mr Mifflin looked a little put out but smiled politely. `` Watch then as I summon the incredible force..,'' `` Should n't the girl do it?'' Dr Smith interrupted again. Mr Mufflin looked down at his daughter as if seeing her for the first time. `` Oh, yes...'' He handed the small control box to her and she pressed the button.

Occasionally it was more interesting than what was on TV, but most of the time it just led to empty bathrooms. In fact, it was mostly just a pain, as Fredrick could n't use a mirror to see how he looked. This led to some awkward situations but thankfully he quickly realized he could use the selfie camera on his phone to fix his face instead. He recalled once looking in the mirror and spotting an alien furry couple having intercourse. He was n't attracted to them, but felt this was a once in a life time opportunity to masturbate to interdimensional pornography. Another time he looked in the mirror to find someone who looked exactly like him. At first he thought his powers must have turned off, but then the other him moved his arm at a slightly different angle than he did. He mouthed to the other him `` can you see me'' only to find the other him was mouthing it along with him. They gathered a notepad and began to communicate. The conversation grew quite boring, as conversations with someone whom you can predict their every sentence tend to get. He discovered the other him's world was basically exactly the same. So they both decided to end the conversation, as the conversation was n't any better than thinking to oneself. Then one day something extra peculiar happened. When he looked in his bathroom mirror, all he saw was a complete black void. He checked the other mirror in his house. About half of them were void as well. He could n't do anything about it so he just went to work like normal. Fredrick was thankful he lived in a city with a lot of public transportation, due to his inability to use mirrors properly driving was extra dangerous. Once at work, he checked the mirrors there. About 3 fourths of them were void. He did n't bother putting much mental effort as to why this was happening. He figured it was just his special ability glitching out. During his coffee break he looked at the view outside. It was already dark. Not just dusk but middle of the night dark. He looked at his watch, it was only 3 pm. He looked around and found his coworkers seemed confused as well. They all gathered outside to look at the sky. It was completely dark, they could n't tell what was happening in the sky.

I watched the passing of a titan. Jared Arthur Shapiro, 1992-2098. The last man to die of old age. I was his friend, caretaker, and comforter. You see, I work professionally as a researcher at Dunham University studying old age. In this day and age it's hard to find subjects outside of textbooks, so I found Jared. He was a rebel. A man who recognized immortality for what it was, a nightmare. You see, while we in the world do not wrinkle and our cells do not decay, everything else associated with it does. Alzheimers and dementia still apply. I live in a world of amnesiacs. People whose memories have to be preserved on external drives, else they forget how to live. I myself am in need of a drive soon, says my doctor. I forgot who my wife was. Jared was the only one who recognized this hell. I say he was alone and sad, but it was a joyful kind of sadness, the kind that you get when you know your life is coming to an end and you gracefully accept it. You know you will be missed, and yet you know that when it comes, You will ride on the wings of an eagle to the light and the love. It is that gorgeous inner peace that will not be known again on this earth. We traded that simple peace for eternal beauty. That was the kind of wisdom Jared loved spouting. I knew him for the last 8 years of his life. He was in pretty bad shape when I went to interview him, because no one knew quite how to care for him anymore, it was a forgotten skill. The poor old man was falling apart at the seams. Unable to leave his house, organs starting to fail, no bowel control, Early stages of Alzheimers, He was a wreck. I cleaned him up and helped him through his final years. Because I, in my profession, knew how to care for him, I was his sole caretaker. Even as his mind and body failed him, he was happy. Jared took pleasure in the smallest, most unexpectedly beautiful things. Flowers, tiny bites of chocolate, porn videos ( which he though were marvelously funny. I remember we watched nine in a row together, hooting and hollering and throwing popcorn at the CompuScreen I gave him ), being wheeled through his garden, even breathing. He took pleasure in breathing! Nobody else I know in this ultra modern age even bothers considering how breathing is what keeps us alive."}

I'd walk around a corner, or reach for something under the ottoman. And there she was. My cat. She would leap at my face. It seemed like fairly normal cat behavior, except that she would do it constantly, in multiple parts of my body. Almost like she was testing my reflexes....figuring out where I was weak. Recently, I had seen her walking through the house, analyzing everything. She always seemed to spend extra time near the knives I keep in the cabinet, and examined all the power tools in the garage. Almost like she was taking an inventory. One time I caught her in my office, leaning over my computer. When she saw me walk in, she made a big show of jumping down and running away. Yet -- I could n't help but notice that my internet history had just been cleared. It really started getting creepy when I'd walk in a room, usually when I was back from work earlier than I had expected, and find a circle of cats assembled on my floor. They would be in a circle, with my cat sitting at the head, like they were having a frickin' seance or something. Sometimes there would be books laid out by them... often gruesome, deathly books that depicted horrific executions and torture. It was getting very bad. I'd be taking a shower and when I came out....there she was. Sitting on the counter, just watching me. A completely straight face, unblinking. Yet something always seemed.....sinister... about those eyes. Then the killing started. Oh, the killing. Dead birds -- -then came the dead raccoons, and otters, and soon enough a fox then a wolf....what kind of cat kills a fox? I was worried, so I thought about bringing my cat to the vet. Like they could do anything. Little did I know it, but she was beyond help then. I was n't, but I did n't know that yet either. She always resisted the visits to the vet though. Honestly, it creeps me out to be with my cat all day in my house... with her always watching. Sometimes I'd just go to the pub, and talk to whoever was there.

A bead of sweat formed upon his brow and slowly ran down the swastika tattooed on his cheek. Jeff was n't a Nazi sympathizer but he had always wanted a tattoo and his condtion required that the tattoo be related to Nazis or Vampires in some way and, understandably, Jeff would rather be associated with Nazism than Twilight.

Because of this, I let her path be guided by her parents and I allow time to let her develop some individuality. I never intervene while she matures, that is not my place. I have been reluctant to fall into love since I gained immortality. Other than giving into my physical desires, relationship building was never something I sought after. That all I changed when I met her, the woman who shattered this notion that I, the man who never can die, was not worthy of love. Now, I spend my days searching for her after her rebirth from death. It has been twenty five years since she left my arms and now, she is a woman again in a different century and I can not wait to see her. My footsteps gently imprint the snow as I walk through the park. I can feel my fingers fidgeting under the warmth of my wool gloves. My heart dances to the same nerves, fluttering while I walk the narrow sidewalk of the aged park. Not a single soul is in sight, just like the past five times I have found her. There is a sort of magic when we cross paths for the first time, an unexplained force that can always be felt. She never remembers it but I do. I never forget. I approach my snow filled imprints, the marks picking up where I started. I see a cab pull up and stop directly in front of the park entrance. A young woman steps out of the car, adoring a vibrant red scarf and knee high boots, she stands and looks up at the snowflakes that fall from the silvery clouds above. I squint my eyes to focus and without delay, I notice her strawberry blonde hair flowing out of the thickly knitted bonnet that dresses her head. My heart races and the familiar feeling in the air thickens when I start to walk in her direction. She looks down from the sky and our eyes lock together. I approach her foolishly, acting as if she may recognize me. Of course, she does not but still, she stands like she is waiting on me to say something. `` Hello, beautiful snow, is n't it?"}

At least it would have been if I was not already working at the same company but in another department. Confusing? Let me explain: I was hired at Coca-Cola more than 10 years ago. In a few years I was a middle manager in charge of online presence. 10 years ago the internet was very different, and when social media appeared I was one of the first in the company to realise it's potential. This catapulted me in the higher circles where I met some pretty influencial people. In just a few years I was one of the youngest bosses there. That's when my life took a turn for the weird. I remember the conversation with the CEO like it was yesterday: - So John, I have a weird proposition for you. I confide in you because I am certain of your loyalty and I know you are motivated not by position or money, but by being challenged every day. So this is what I want you to do ( At this point I was fairly certain that I was either fired or received a promotion. Nothing could have prepared me for what came next ) - I want to to get a job at Pepsi Co. And then to spy on them to me. You will get an enourmous sum of money from us where you can fuel your drug habit. I looked at him with a blank stare, I thought I had hidden my drug problems quite well. Apparantely I did not. Anyway, that was a few years ago. I applied to Pepsi and presented myself at the interview as a disgrunted employee that wants to jump ship. As I was relative known in the industry and I knew lots of things about Coca-Cola I was quickly hired. I would give them honest insight as best I knew and I also made friends with the people I worked. It was not hard as I always managed to make friends. Every weekend I would meet a guy at a fast food joint and we would discuss what I have learned that week. So during the years I would slowly climb ranks inside the company, gaining some promotions along the way, and at the same time getting a lot more money from cocacola for information. Soon I was able to get vital information about strategy and vision from the VPs and high placed managers there. This quite good life ended a few months ago when I was called in the office of one of many VPs there, a guy named Clint."}

In truth, the nanobugs are a marvel and a wonder to behold. They work with such efficiency and with such speed, even able to reproduce and heal; all working toward their own goal. It \u2019 s hard to remember that side of the nanobugs when you \u2019 re one of the infected. When you wake up coughing a lung full of tiny robots into the sink, it \u2019 s hard to remember that these little bastards are anything other than a virus to us. Patient Zero, a woman who remained anonymous until her death, first showed symptoms of the nano virus in Quebec, Canada. Soon, it spread throughout the United States, Russia and China. Eastern Europe, Africa, South America and Japan remained clean for months, while the rest of us were in strict quarantine. The quarantines were lifted once it was announced the virus could only spread through direct fluid contact. It was also announced that the bugs died when sneezed or spat or otherwise excreted. That was their first mistake. The nanobugs didn \u2019 t exactly die, but went into a state of suspended animation. Once they came in contact with a living being, they \u2019 d snap back into action. The virus spread throughout the world in a month. It was only then that a serious cure was sought after. The first answer came in the form of intense radiation, nearly killing the patient; bombarding the patient and host with radiation, hoping the nanobugs fried before the patient did. With the speed at which the bugs worked, radiation was almost always a death sentence. The second answer came in the form of our own nanobugs. If you can \u2019 t beat then, join them. After much research and debate, dormant bugs \u2019 coding was rewritten to fight off their own kind. While the nanobugs \u2019 original programming remained a mystery, other than to dissolve their host into a puddle of goo, these new nanobugs were made to protect their host. Nurses keep reminding me that I received my injection just days before I would have died. Comforting. They might be called nano, but you still feel them. Their tiny little legs and lasers scraping away at your insides. Well, now, imagine them fighting one another. The excess of bug carcasses leads to a mass evacuation from every orifice. It \u2019 s wonderful. And the smell. Just a constant smell of fried wiring and burnt metal. You emit it, you smell it, you taste it. You hear the tiny scraping and tiny legs whirring bout in your ears. You see them march across your pupils."}

I had spent the last 3 weeks studying for the exam, ignoring friend invites, sleep and hunger. I had given my soul studying for the exam and I had walked in feeling very confident. But now as I was looking at the questions, I was becoming overly anxious. I was n't recognizing any of the questions and it felt like the test was written in a different language. In fact, I slowly realized that it was written in a different language. It looked like there were a bunch of dots over the o and it definitely looked like a bunch of the e's and a's were accented. Had I walked in to the wrong exam room? No that could n't be it. I had double checked the room number a couple times before walking in and the test booklet had my name on it. I might have signed up for the wrong exam. But no, I flipped to the front of the exam booklet and it was written clearly in English that it was the 2016 Final Exam for my class. Then why was it in a different language? I looked up at the time, I had wasted 20 minutes stressing out. I had only 40 minutes left to answer 80 questions. I weighed my decisions. Either I could try solving the problems in a language I could n't even recognize, stressing out the whole time while crying to myself. Or i could answer the scantron randomly, leave early and cry my self to sleep at home. I decided I would rather cry at home. C looked like a good answer for the first question. A for the second, B for the third spelled CAB. I then spelled DAD, BAD, ACE, and DAB. I then decided to BAA like a sheep a couple of times. The best word I came up with was DECADE. And that's how I finished my test up until the last 5 questions where I put them all as C because it's always C. I stood up, turned in my exam and then went home, locked my self in my room and cried to myself for 5 days straight. On the fifth day I had enough. If i was going to repeat the entire year, so be it. The made me feel a little better. A couple months passed without incident. Until one random day I received a call from a number I did n't recognize."}

As a child it was just like a really vivid imaginary friend, but at some point in your childhood you learn to be afraid of things. It was one of the first things that I became afraid of. I'm sure it caused my parents some frustration, as there were days where I would just break down in tears. I learned not to talk about it later. At that point the fear got split, half for The Presence, and half for people looking at me weird for being afraid of, from their perspective, nothing. A few years later i started to resent it. It was just THERE! All the time. It took me 3 tries to lose my virginity cause I swear i could feel it MORE during that time. Hell, once I'm pretty sure it saved my life. Not The Presence so much directly. It was college, and I was getting REALLY drunk. I was young and thought I could keep going. And that's when I realized I DID N'T feel it. I'd been pretty sloshed before and still felt it ( did n't care as much when drunk tho ) but at that moment I did n't. So that was when i stopped drinking for the night. I still wound up in the hospital for alcohol poisoning. Anymore, The Presence is just....part of life. It's just THERE. I try to ignore it and move on with my life. It's affected a few of my decisions though. I went skydiving just to see if it could keep up. Also did a brief desert trek. Still there. Those kind of upset me, but they were also both amazing experiences. That's how things have been for the past few years. Until today. Today, a package showed up from Amazon that I did n't order. Not such a big deal, it could have been a present. It was n't. Inside was a Ouji board, or something like it. This was hand carved and had a different layout. The little letter selector was replaced by a handful of numbers. The shipping label had something in the note section.'We need to talk.' I was a fair bit shocked. Some of the child's fear returned, but the adult mind suppressed it. The thought went that anything that wanted to talk probably did n't mean harm. Besides, the lion share of my mind was taken up by one thing: curiosity. I put the board on the coffee table and made sure all the numbers were face up. Then thinking about it I dead-bolted my door."}

At first, it was simply an absence - a squirrel who I'd always seen outside my window, a dear pet, a beloved but distant grandfather. Those early lessons, no different from anyone else's, left no great impression on my young mind. But as I grew, and aged, they became more insistent. Far-away tragedies - wars, natural disasters - seemed to occur at critical moments to pull me out of my self-absorption. Those close to me came and went. My parents passed, and I was thrust into responsibility for my own life. Friends - good and bad influences alike - came to unfortunate ends before I could be pulled onto their paths and away from that determined for me long ago. None of those losses hurt as much as her. She gave my life meaning it had never had. In the time I had with her - all too brief - nothing else mattered. Her suffering was the hardest lesson of all. I cursed God who I mistakenly blamed for taking her from me, science that could not save her, other people and forces for no better reasons. Of course I blamed myself as well. The years that followed were dark and lonesome. And finally death - not the dark, ominous concept, but the being itself - stood before me. For the first time, I looked into his eyes. I saw his relief - almost an innocence, like I'd had before he first made his power known to me. Happiness to be rid of his burden, too - an overwhelming joy I'd not felt since before he'd stolen my love from me. He may no longer hold the power he'd given me, but the wisdom of eons remained. He could see my thoughts - my anger as I thought back to all that he had taken from me, all he had put me through. And I saw his fear, a familiar sensation from when I felt that my own death was close. But I also thought back on all he'd taught me. The old man cowered before me. Stripped of his power, he was a mere mortal standing before Death. A situation he'd been in countless times before. But now, he was the one to await Death's judgment..."}

As long as he could control everything. After growing up with more stepdaddies than any one girl needs to realize life is shit, I found him.

Another Thud and hiss as the airlock slowly opens, revealing the travelers sheltering behind it. `` So... This is what the true natural ecosystem smells like. Much better recycled air any day, I must say.'' The voice of a small, squint eyed woman said. That voice was n't heard in this place in centuries. If the planet could talk, it would say that voice was n't welcomed. `` Hurry, kids! Come on see your new home!'' She said excitedly stepping aside and leaning on the airlock door and squinted her eyes into even narrower shape as she looked into the light filtered through the fresh and moist leaves of trees. `` Hurry up, slowpoke'' A high pitched voice of a boy said, the soundwaves heading back to dimmed red lighted cockpit of the vessel `` Hold on! My limbs are still numb from the hibernation''. It was the boy's sister. She was as beautiful as she was designed to be. Pale skin, blue eyes. A perfect body of an adolescent little girl. `` Look!

A small and flat device lit up and curvy and angular symbols that remind of eastern buildings appeared on it. `` Input the material'' A robotic buzzing voice said The mom walked to a pond `` I am thirsty mom!

Once I was within arms reach, he lunged at me and stabbed, the tip of his knife connecting with the area on my chest just above the heart. The blade shattered upon impact. `` **GAH! **'', the assassin exclaimed as he flinged what was left of the knife to the side.

You see, that's one thing we're damn good at, making things last. And the only reason the LES1 ceased transmission was because a fault in it's launch put it in an imperfect orbit, so honestly, had we know a bit more about which way it went, we could have told you that it could come back.

In the past Gabe always preferred to use the stairs, they kept him spry, but these days even he would admit that he wasn \u2019 t in the same condition that he used to be. Like the faithful old factory around him, he was ready to rest. He drew his readers from his pocket, bringing them up to the bridge of his nose and holding the one remaining ear piece for stability in lieu of letting them rest unevenly on his face. The missive was simple and to the point, the sort of thing that he wouldn \u2019 t have been bothered with in the past \u2013 not his department, after all \u2013 but as the one left behind to declare the work complete, certain minutia had made its way into his purview. Gabe squinted as the elevator doors opened again, sliding his glasses back into his breast pocket. It always took a few moments to adjust to the lighting in the Governor of Development \u2019 s office, but things seemed particularly brighter today. As always, Gabe focused on the figure in the middle of it all and soldiered forward, undeterred. There was business to attend to. The Governor turned, smiling the same warm smile that she had greeted him with on his first day. While most would have expected a man in her position, the Governor had always been content to defy those expectations, being all things to all people; cordial and familiar with everyone, and close with but a few. The consensus around the factory was that she looked like Angela Bassett, but in a private moment years ago she had confided in Gabe that it was the other way around. No matter. Gabe simply knew her as the one who always greeted him with a smile and a warm arm around his shoulders, and today was no different."}

And with a deep and heavy sigh, I made up my mind. My mother walked into the room, surprised that I was already up. `` Excited for your first day at your new school?'' she asked, smiling. I could n't even muster an answer. She frowned, closing the door with care. I showered, my face against the stream, as the water mixed with tears. I got to school. Walked to the entrance, hoping against hope that somehow... it would be different. That she would n't see me. `` Hey fool,'' a voice said behind me, and I felt my heart drop. I turned to see the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, looking at me with a mischevious grin. A sight I'd never be able to forget. `` Want to ditch this place?'' she asked, nodding at the school. She looked like the best kind of trouble. `` Olivia, I'm sorry,'' I said, forcing the words out, `` but I just ca n't.'' She grabbed me before I could go. `` How do you know my name?'' I shook my head, realising the error I'd made. `` Please, just let me go.'' She peered into my eyes, as I looked into hers. Crystal blue. So much depth to them, so much pain. `` Come on, I just want some company,'' she said, as her face softened, `` I'm just feeling really low today.'' She grinned. `` Besides; I think you're really cute.'' I stared at her, glancing once back at school. I felt my heart beat faster, louder. Maybe this time, it would work out. Maybe *we'd* work out. Maybe this time, I could stop her from losing her mind. **** /r/CroatianSpy"}

If you have any questions, forget about them, because this is a guided tour and your questions wo n't make any sense. Yes, I meant that, I'm not being funny. We are standing currently at the entrance of this individual's mind. As many of you can already tell, it's a male, well done on you. For those interested, you will see the overall picture from here, he does *not* think about sexual intercourse every seven seconds. He thinks about it every so often. Over to the left, you have Friendship Valley. Why is it a valley? What did I say about questions? Anyways, you can see from here that it has high walls, protected on a constant basis and it is *not* a prison. It's a uptopia for all the thoughts of the mind reserved for his closest friends. As we continue, directly ahead of us is the main thinking cortex. It's powerful, but it's not clever. Intelligence is relative ma'am, just like your face. Some may think you beautiful, but people are allowed to be *wrong*. You will notice that the storage area is large and has already been divided into several important sections. Notice that *Adventure Time* is becoming a permanent part of this storage and is currently under construction. Coming up on our left, you will see the Spite and Anger, Fear and Distrust part of the individual's mind. Of course it's large, have you seen what's on the internet? Makes your blood boil. It's storage unit for images and videos is fairly small, but we all make mistakes by focusing on one specific moment, do n't we all? Question? Well, I do n't have an answer. Onto the next portion! Here we have the creativity filter and thought process creation. It look complex, but if you look at the diagram, then you'll discover it's rather simple. No ma'am, again, no questions. Nor do I have the time or crayons to describe this for you. One of the things that is currently on this individual's mind is writing out stories, specifically on a typewriter. But since he does n't want to appear hipster, he's going for a pretentious gamer look with a mechanical keyboard, colored like a toy. An interesting exhibit indeed. Oh! And look! You can see the latest thing this individual is working on! It's a short story about describing the inner parts of your mind. Who knows? Maybe he took the prompt a little bit too literally, but I think we can all imagine that it's bound to fail. Next! The last exhibit."}

As I left the office, I debated crapping before I left, but decided I'd much rather do the deed on my home turf. I sat in traffic for what felt like hours. The pressure built to an almost unbearable level. When I finally got home, I bolted from my car like an olympic sprinter. I parked on the curb and sprinted across the lawn. If I had not been so focused on evacuating my bowels, I might have noticed that an unfamiliar van was parked in my driveway or that the door was slightly ajar or that several of my most precious possessions were gone. But I did not. As I rushed into that bathroom and dropped my pants, all I could think about was sweet, sweet release. I am not in the habit of documenting my bowel movements, but if I were keeping a list of my top ten all time greatest shits, this one would have easily topped it. The feeling was literally orgasmic. I had never passed anything like this before. I moaned with pleasure, howled in agony, and wept in awe at the new and incredible sensations I was feeling. after I finished, I knew in my heart that I would n't even have to wipe. In a stupor, I stumbled to the kitchen, popped a bottle of champagne and opened a box of Triscuit\u00ae crackers to celebrate the life-changing shit that had just gone down. Just then, I heard a faint thud coming from my bathroom. Probably just the house settling, but it made me realize that I had forgotten to flush in my post-bowel movement ecstasy. As I walked towards the bathroom to flush, I heard another thud. This time I realized I was hearing footsteps. I grabbed the only candlestick that had n't been stolen and brandished it as I crept towards the cracked door. I silently opened the door, only to see a man clad head-to-toe in black kneeling by my toilet with his sleeves rolled up taking my shit."}

A choice had been made, a decision came down -of corporate screwups this was a gem. Down through the chimney, choking black soot, the Devil himself landed on cloven foot. -- - At his side was an elf or an elf of a sort -it had great snaggly teeth and long nose to snort. Up on the roof eight homunculi lingered, tethered to a sled made of bones and of fingers. With lost souls Santa's house may be crammed, but Christmas was now the Night of the Damned. -- - Satan surveyed the home he was in and noticed something amiss. Despite the late hour, there arose such a din, the devil was writhing in bliss. From the living room came the sounds of a fight, a family's dysfunctional christmas play -and one they play each christmas night and every damned Christmas day. -- - `` What's going on, why this tumult and toss?'' The Devil asked with a grin. `` I'm just here to drop off this shit, now which one of you here is the boss?'' The fighting about whose relatives sucked worse was cut off by the sight of these things. A demon carrying a red sack of toys stood beside Satan's red, folded wings. The man of the house, a drinker and lout, stepped forward and stumbled and fumbled about -dripping beer from a bottle still in his snout. -- - Draining the bottle, tossing it away, the man bellied up to the Devil to bray, `` this is MY house, you red-skinned old fool -nobody tells this guy what to do.'' But instead all he said was `` that's me,'' and that's good because the devil had n't time to do the things that he would -if this man were in hell as well he should! -- - The devil looked over the family before the anger and hatred for each other they bore should defeat their sensible fear of himself and foolishly think he was some christmas elf so on with his speech he did press. `` You people amaze me, the life you depict. I've never known any more in love with conflict. You argue and fight, through the day and the night, and had I things my way, you'd be coming to stay, in the deepest pit I possess. But no time now to talk of these things, I have a mission I'm pressed to complete. I must deliver these fetid fool toys before the moon begins its retreat."}

Villain escapes jail, villain calls out hero, hero falls in trap, villain monologues about plan, hero breaks out of trap, hero defeats villain, villain goes to jail, circle starts over. Yet here I stand, the bloodied and lifeless corpse of my greatest arch-enemy lying in my arms. The day started like any other. I'd just made my greatest escape ever. Using suction pads and various elements of stealth, I was able to make it to the entrance of the prison, by clopping along on the ceiling. There were one or two mistakes that almost made me fall face first in front of a guard station, but for the most part it went pretty smoothly. After that, it was just a matter of slipping under the nearest bus, and I was home free. There was quite a bit of dust on the computers in my lair. It had been almost a year since I'd been put into the prison, and not everyone has a butler that some goody-two-shoes hero can have. I booted up the machine, and looked through the files. Use a tractor beam to move the moon? Did that last time. Shark tank? Not at todays shark prices. Labyrinth? Too old fashioned. I turned off the computer and just decided to do a simple kidnapping. After all, what could go wrong? The trap had been set. The hero alerted. The woman dangled from a rope high above the factory floor, where a simple little setup of circular saws awaited her body. It was simple enough. He would burst in, I would shoot the rope, she would fall, he would leap over and save her, inches away from the saws, in the meantime, sending me over the edge just above the saws with this convenient rope trap I set up below my feet. On cue, the hero appeared. Shot fired, hero saved girl, villain dangling from ceiling. The perfect ending. Except for what happened next. He gloated. The hero does n't gloat! Something's wrong here! He raised his spear, and uttered a death threat. Kill me? But what about our back and forth? The game is n't a game when someone refuses to play by the rules. The hero thrust forward, as I pulled myself upwards on the rope, the spear missing, but the hero falling off balance and falling into the deathtrap below. I'd won, right? The hero dead, the villain victorious. It did n't feel like a victory I wanted. I was free to do what I wanted. To rule this city with an iron fist."}

He could n't believe the junior detective's report. The dude looked like a burnt out hippie who would n't harm a butterfly. The video he was watching was mesmerizing him, practically putting him to sleep. He continued to glance through the report, looking at crime scene photos with `` The Joy of Painting'' playing in the background. He flipped through half a dozen different crime scene photos before he got to one that looked strangely familiar. `` Highbury road. Highbury road. Highbury road.'' There were no exterior shots of the road, so he went to google maps, and was unnerved to find it adjacent to a beautiful mountain range that overlooked one of the clearest and calmest lakes on the county. He could be onto something. His brain told him it could n't be, but his heart was dropping. If this crime scene had been painted by Bob Ross, it was a link. He had run successful investigations on similar hunches before. He walked into the lieutenants office to ask for money to buy the Bob Ross `` The Joy of Painting'' full collection to investigate more when he froze. `` Can I help you sir?'' Bobby was silent. `` HELLO!'' The lieutenants yell woke him from his gaze. `` Lieutenant, I think the junior detective may have been onto something.'' Bobby held the scenic photo of the location he had just printed, with a spot circled for the location of the crime scene. Behind the lieutenants head was a Bob Ross painting, somehow identical to the scene he had printed out. The only difference was a hanging tree, with beautiful yellow fall leaves, except for one red one, in the identical spot he had circled to mark the crime scene. `` OFFICER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY OFFICE?'' The lieutenant was not a patient man. `` Sir, I think this detective may be on to something,'' Bobby said in a scared, whimpering tone, his mouth still hanging ajar. `` There's just too much evidence in this file to be a coincidence. But, sir there's something more...''"}

The lazy summer sunlight burned his retinas and he quickly closed them while stretching and letting out a yawn. He did not have much reason to wake up these days. He sat on the edge of his bed, hoping for any sound but knew there was n't going to be any until he forced his aging frame off the bed. He glanced out the window with a sigh, bent over to grab clothes off the floor. Three months and two days ago, his wife was taken by a sudden heart attack. The widow maker it was called, and it lived up to its reputation. He quietly went about his days, wondering when they would be up. On his way to his dusty couch, Frank decided today would be the day he finally left his house again. He lived a few blocks from a diner he and his wife used to frequent. The diner just like the customers that kept it open; worn out, frayed, but full of memories. As he entered the door, the cook and two patrons stopped arguing baseball and looked towards the door. `` Frank!'' the cook shouted, `` It's been so long, I thought you moved. I'll have your food right up!'' and with that the cook disappeared in the back before Frank could say anything. Frank slumped in his usual booth over looking the street. As he sat, he interrupted a layer of dust particles, and they angerly floated away to a new resting spot. After a few minutes of car watching, the cook laid two plates down on the table. Frank was n't able to explain his wife would n't be joining him anymore. `` Enjoy! I gave the lady a little less mayo, just the way she likes it!'' and before Frank could retaliate, another regular appeared and the cook jetted off to greet him. Frank stared at the accidental sandwich and wondered what he would do with it. He did not have to wonder long as a young boy plopped on the booth across from him, disturbing the freshly settled dust. `` How's it going mister!'' eagerly stated the boy. `` Uh, erm, what can I do for you boy'' stuttered Frank. This was the first time he had talked in months. `` My dog ran away and I've spent all day looking for him. I have n't found him and I started to get hungry so I came in here to see if I could work for food.'' Frank pushed the plate closer to the boy."}

The first thing I did was gasp for air, which was something I'd never thought I'd do again when I felt the life leaving my body. It the most unique breath I'd ever taken though, I did n't remember breathing feeling quite like this, and it took me a few more moments of hard panting to figure out why. I did n't need to breath, my entire body felt odd and unnatural, I was dead. I knew I was dead, I could feel the lifelessness of my body. I was n't sure why I had a body. My face was pressed against a stone floor. I kept breathing out of habit, although the knowledge I did n't need to made the whole operation pretty uncomfortable. I opened my eyes. I felt like I was waking up after just not enough sleep. There was a pair of shoes, a nice pair of shoes. Black, polished shoes. My brain did n't really start processing this whole situation until I tilted my head up to see who was wearing the shoes. It was me. It was simply unmistakably me, sitting on a stool, looking down on me. The other Me was wearing a fitted suit that matched the black shoes. He was looking at me incredulously. I flipped myself onto my back and then propped myself up on my elbows and looked back. Other Me had slightly longer hair than me. He looked in his late 20s to early 30s, the same age as me. He seemed a little healthier. He was still looking at me with deep confusion, a gaze I realized I was probably reciprocating. I decided to speak up. `` So, I think I'm in hell. I'm not sure who you are or what you're doing here though.'' He sustained his stare but responded, `` Okay... okay.'' He swallowed, his face was that of a man trying to grasp a situation he'd never prepared for, but he kept his cool, ``... so, hell. So you're dead.'' I nodded, `` I for sure am, last thing I remember before this was getting stabbed by a guy.'' `` Why'd he stab you?'' `` I owed him some money. He was a drug dealer.'' I did n't see any point in lying to myself. I always figured that once I hit the afterlife, any facade would be pretty pointless. `` Okay... and that's the last thing you remember before you got here.'' I gave him a thumbs up, `` that's all I got."}

The rest of them rushed into the hall, clamoring over the legendary weapons and trying to pick them up. Every weapon in the hall has been used by countless hands. They all have their own stories, their own personalities. Some weapons will give themselves up every generation, and some are so picky that they will only choose a rare sort of personality, or give themselves up in case of emergency. The eager boys are given the easiest weapons. I tried to pretend to be an eager one, and went straight to the Scythe of Fortune, which cut wheat twice as fast as any normal tool. It became insubstantial in my hands. Several farmer's sons tried for it after me, but none could grasp it. The Horn of Plenty, Bottomless Vessel, and Twin Staff were similarly affected. The farming children looked at each other with concern. It was going to be a bad harvest year, and there was nothing we could do about it. One by one, the boys were chosen by weapons of destruction. My little brother, who was told that there was a special toy in this cave that was just for him, had chosen a small black carving of a horse before I could stop him. The remaining three of us were older, and knew what the horses were. No other weapons would have us. We tried all of them, except for the three little horses that nobody wanted to touch. Benji caved first. His small hand shook as he took the red horse and put it into his pocket. Two left. Paeter took the next horse. It took us a week before its insidious beauty worked its way into Paeter's soul. He looked on me with pity as he left. He looked fine in his barbarous splendor and pale green bow. He nocked an arrow at me, pity in his eyes, and let it fly. I spent a year, grasping at weapons that refused my touch. I worked the plague arrow all the way through my heart. I did not die. I waited hundreds of years, but no more children came to claim weapons from the hall. Men are not solitary beasts. I did what I could, and I resisted for thousands of years... but the voice of the ivory horse is sweet. In short, it drove me mad. Thousands of years after I'd entered the cave, I reached out and picked up the horse. The rest of me is riding on the pale horse. I found my brothers, waiting for me."}

Tears me to shreads inside. You'd think by now I'd be use to it, would have built up some type of tolerance or indifference to it. nope. `` What are you doing in here? Sometimes I wonder how you'd survive once you leave this house.'' she spat up at me. `` Dad wanted to know if you're going to have dinner with us..'' She laughed. But it wasnt warm like it used to be. She always gets dark when she's working on her mysterious hobbies in the basement. She broods and becomes highly irritable when interrupted. She returns to her work without saying a word. But she's said everything. She's told me she'd rather be here on her hobby then up eating as a family with us. fine, fuck her than.

Knives swim through the air on a direct path to my dad. The best dad in the world. I think how could such a loving father ever fall in love with that creature in the basement. My heart beats dangerously at my chest in panic. Then it happened. My dad's eyes caught a glimpse of his death, and then he was... I do n't know how to describe it. It was elegant, like he was dancing. But it was beautiful, almost ethereal. He danced around and between the knives like time was insignificant to him. Even bigger I realised I could see this all, how could I see time slow down and him move through them. Knives clatter onto the floor behind my father. Standing in silence we look at each other. I stand in awe. He stares back in... fear? Realisation crashes over me. My father is The Blur. OH MY GOD MY WONDERFUL FATHER IS A HERO TO OTHERS!"}

It's her special triple chocolate layer cake.'' Sam's eyes widened and eyebrows raised just a bit. `` Oh, sweet! Your Aunt makes the best cakes. Her bakery is the talk of the town.'' I could tell Sam was excited. Sam also loved chocolate cake, just like me. As we walked down the sidewalk towards the party, the cool fall wind brushed against my arms. I was only wearing a T-shirt. I guess my mom was right, maybe I should have wore a jacket when I left for school this morning. `` So...'' said Sam, then after a short pause hesitantly and nervously continued, `` How do you think you did on Ms. Mori's math test today?'' Ms. Mori was our 7th grade math teacher. She was nice and pretty smart, but her exams were n't exactly a cake walk. I could tell Sam did n't think the test today was easy. `` Eh, alright.'' I replied. `` I think'x' equaled 12, and 12 - 12 is 0. So, I think the final answer was zero.'' Sam kinda just stared forward, `` Oh, I guess I just could n't make the connection.'' Sam replied, mind drifting. I guess he was thinking about something else. But that's when it happened, and it happened so fast. At that moment we were no longer on the side walk, but rather in the middle of the cross walk and crossing the street. There was a red car, going three times faster then it should have been going on this quiet suburban street. Sam's mind was still drifting. He did n't see it coming. I pushed Sam forward, out of the crosswalk and onto the sidewalk. No car was getting my best friend today. At least not while I was alive and kicking. Slowly, Sam's screaming faded into silence, and as the doctor slapped my ass, a new screaming filled the room. I could see my mother's smile. Her face glowed like that of any mother of a new born baby. And once again, I was back at the beginning. This time I was only sent 12 years into the past. Last time it was 37; I was a fireman inside a burning building saving lives."}

Brian was afraid to get too close to this particular point in space, for fear that it would electrocute him. Brian was paranoid of being electrocuted. \u201c I got a stick. Here!

It doesn \u2019 t even seem to be moving. Poke it and see if it moves! What are you scared of? \u201d Brian remembered the last time someone had goaded him into poking something. It was years ago, when he was much younger. His schoolmates teased him, and called him all sorts of names, until he crumbled under the peer pressure, and went ahead with the poking. Since then, Brian had a subtle phobia of light sockets. He still has nightmares about light switches, electrical cords, and high tension wires. \u201c Listen buddy! There \u2019 s no way in hell I \u2019 m going to poke this thing. If you want to see what happens when you poke it, then YOU poke it. In fact, I think you \u2019 re a coward if you don \u2019 t poke it! \u201d Brian thought about this statement, and deep in the back of his mind, he felt guilty for calling his friend names for not poking something. Brian looked at Marlow and apologized. \u201c I \u2019 m sorry. You \u2019 re not a coward. Maybe we could throw something at it instead? \u201d Marlow laughed, and plunged the stick forward into the strange, peculiar, particular, point in space.

My dad said from behind the drywall. I was in the laundry room, cleaning up the spoils of my exploits. `` That coin guy?'' I added in two more scoops of bleach, blood was a lot harder to get off than I'd like to consider. `` Whoever that is is messed up in the head.'' My sister rang out -- she was home for the weekend from college, and she was never too good with dealing with clothes. `` Kills a bunch of guys with pennies and mugs them too.'' I'd say that was a worthy return of investment though. `` How come I have to do your laundry?'' Not that I minded it, giving me the perfect excuse and all to deal with cleaning blood. `` Because you get paid by dad to do it anyway.'' She ruffled my hair. `` And I do n't want to see your sister's lady things, I'm already more than traumatized enough from your mother's.'' `` Fair enough.'' Five bucks for the whole shebang was n't too bad, having recently come to a new source of income. `` Thanks dweeb.'' She left after that and dad moved on to a different channel. In my defense, I was at least a slightly more selfish Robin Hood doing the city a favor."}

Thanks to your deaths, your fathers will relent, and His people will be freed. Even that change of heart will not last, and your fathers will be crushed beneath the Red Sea.

Most of the time it gets inherited, but I tell people it skipped me, just so I can avoid the way people look at me and the awkwardness that inevitably follows when I tell them what I can do. Everyone has a little bit inside them, so I can feel people nearby if i try. Hell - I can feel a rat if the concentration is high enough. My friends know, and they make fun of me for it, but then there are lots of strange Benders out there. I heard some guy in Japan can Bend WiFi, and Ryan said there is a Bagpipebender going viral on YouTube! Loads of new ones are coming to light with all the recent innovations. I did n't see much use for my Bending skill, other than becoming a professional cleaner or some crap like that. I mean I have pulled some pretty nasty pranks with it over the years, but now I've left school, I ca n't find anything meaningful to do with it. However that all changed when I visited the bank last Tuesday. Just as I turned from the cashier a massive gust of air blew me back against against the glass, and the line of customers were swept to the walls. Five guys in balaclavas had burst through the doors `` This is a robbery, everyone stay against the wall!'' One of them shouted. He swept his hands forward, clenched his fists, and suddenly the all the windows; the glass I was pressed against, shattered and collapsed into fragments. `` If anyone pulls any shit my friend the Firebender here will roast you alive!'' The next guy span around, swept his arms and flicked his hands up, and suddenly the cash resisters all opened and thousands of pound spewed out, fluttering into the large duffel bags held wide open by the others. In a matter of seconds they were filled, and turned to leave, when a burly man rose up and shouted `` Cowards! The Benders Division will rip the shit out of you! You wo n't get away with this!'' One man turned back and said `` We already have.'' And he thrust his hand forward, a ball of flame engulfing his victim. As the Firebender laughed and the helpless man screamed in mindless agony, I got angry. And he had given me an idea. I was n't useless. I suddenly had a purpose."}

I was reclined in a chair designed by a whole team of engineers, hooked up to a machine that cost more money to develop than I'd ever see in a lifetime. I could feel cold electrodes against multiple points on my head, shaved for the procedure. I was nervous, everyone one, though the people who put blood, sweat, tears and untold number of hours of their life into this project were n't putting their life on the line. They said the transfer process was painless, and effortless, but there was the risk of not being able to come back. I did n't really want to come back anyway... I had nothing else left here which made me a perfect candidate. 'The transfer will begin in one minute.' a voice said over an hidden speaker somewhere in the featureless room.'We're performing our final calculations. Stay calm, everything will be fine. Half of the project has been designed by our AI and has eliminated any room for human error. You are in good hands.'' I took a deep breath. Stay calm, everything will be fine. I started to think about the other side. I wondered how it would be to be within the machine. To digitize my consciousness. They had created a virtual reality interface for me on the other side where they would conduct further tests. `` Transfer commencing in 3...'' I closed my eyes, prepared for... whatever comes next, `` 2...'' Deep breath. Stay Calm, `` 1... Activate.'' Blackness. Like someone turned off a light switch. Then light. Nothing but white. I looked around. I was n't in the chair, at least not the same chair I was in. It was an old reclining chair, dusty and tattered. I was naked, but looked like a ken doll, smooth all over for whatever reason. In front of me, I saw a table that I could swear was n't there a moment ago. On it: a white envelope with'Subject 01' written on it and a TV remote next to it. I guessed that the envelope was for me... Subject 01 was what I was referred to by the engineers. I opened it up, ignoring the remote for now. In the envelope was a letter. On it were the words:'Press Power.' I looked to the remote and back at the letter. These guys made a really weird interface for me. But I guess this is all about research and experimentation. I followed the instructions and pressed power."}

Today much like yesterday has been nothing more than a babysitting job. FourtyNine and myself stand guard over what I can only assume is a weapons testing bunker, we are not allowed to enter, nor do we check anyone. IMS private security screens its employees. We just wait outside. Muscle to be flexed when the time arises. We never see one another outside of our gear, and rarely speak unless we need to. We are all numbers. I am Fifty. It is all business as usual. Our gear is top of the line, S-343 power suits with a full array of monitoring addons. It enhances and supports our bodies increasing reaction time as well as proportionately increasing our strength. Makes taking a piss a dangerous activity. Our primary weapon is a Phase 3 PulseRifle with enough battery to take down a small country. Our sidearm is a S22 ballistic pistol, along with 3 concussion grenades and a single EMP. The helmet is a fully self sustained life support system with all the bells and whistles to let its user live in the harshest environments for up to 72 hours. It is still cold, I never did enjoy the bitter cold of science. All provided and maintained by IMS, a bit much for a wallflower job if you ask me. I would have been happy with my leathers and a plain old 12ga shotgun. The pay is good and I am not the one to ask questions. November 19, 2067 I have n't seen FourtyNine in a few days, been flying solo. Guess the brass at IMS figured watching the dirt is a job one man can handle. Normal movement into and out of the bunker. A pretty young scientist whose name tag identified her as Dr.Heller has joined the team. Despite the large age gap she seems to have more control than the rest of the faceless lab coats I see. I got a call from my handler today, Lydia took her first steps today. I wish I could be there. December 13, 2067 Almost a month has passed since anything has changed. Everyday seems to bleed into the next a constant flow of labcoats into the bunker. I am curious to see what is happening in there, for no other reason than to sate my thirst for a change in scenery. Shit brown walls, brown doors, caution markings on the walls. Blast doors I suppose. Fuck I am sick of this. FortyEight joined me today. He is taller than FortyNine.

Not because I was a rebel, not because I was trying to act cool for anyone, it's just that I was allowed to. For my entire life I have been allowed to loiter as much as I want, my best friend is allowed as many offenses of battery as he wants and his wife is luckily a masochist that is allowed to abuse drugs, but I'm the only person I know that is allowed the freedom to stand around anywhere I want to without consequences. No one can tell me to get off of their property and, as far as I'm concerned, all property is my property to an extent. I make my living by loitering in the doorways of secured places, places like banks or prisons, and letting other people in and out.

I opened the door and stepped out into the rain, into the darkness, where the only light for miles in any direction were my headlights. Our town was a small town with a size of around five thousand people. Here, you'd suspect that everyone would know everyone else, but even our community had its `` cliques,'' our own circles of friends. Sure, people would recognize and greet each other as we passed by, but talk to each other? Not really. So when someone struggles silently, they struggle here just as they would anywhere -- nobody cares. It was half past midnight, so the fields outside our town were dark, and everyone inside our town were asleep, all their lights shut off. He flinched at the sound of my voice, although I'm certain he must've seen my headlights coming back into town. `` What are you doing?'' ``...'' I slowly walked towards him, not even bothering to close the door behind me. `` Mister --'' I began, but my foot kicked something along the ground. It was a tipped-over pill bottle, with some of its little contents spilling out. Even in the dark, I could tell it was a new bottle. `` Mister, can you just... can you just step back over here and we can talk about it?'' I spoke softly, making sure to not startle him again, as I quietly approached him from behind. He did n't bother turning around. `` No, I'm fine right here.'' His voice was cold, steady, and certain of what he was going to do. I knew I had to choose my words wisely. `` Mind if I sit with you?'' He shook his head. I kicked off my heals and looked over the bridge. Vertigo immediately overtook me, but I closed my eyes and breathed deeply before taking a seat beside him. `` So, um, what are you doing here?'' I asked again. He did n't reply. We sat there silently, listening to the rain splatter on the ground behind us. Moments turned to minutes, and minutes felt like hours, just sitting on the edge of death, together. `` Knock knock.'' A confused look washed over his face, which was better than the stoicity it had for the past hour. ``... what?'' he asked, turning to face me. `` Knock knock,'' I repeated. I could feel him looking at my face for what seemed like eternity, before he replied, `` Who's there?'' `` Orange.'' The corner of his lip turned up. `` Orange who?'' I turned to him. `` Orange you glad I'm here?'' I said with a smile, reaching up to poke his nose like a button."}

It spattered the walls where unfortunate souls had been thrown into them. Some of it was even on the ceiling, dripping almost silently onto the carpet below. But most of all, it stained the silver fur of my muzzle until it was black. I began to feed on one of the corpses. *Corpse* probably was n't the right word for something that still wiggled in pain as I bit into the soft flesh of it's stomach. I tried not to think to hard about that. These men were dead and the beast was hungry. *It's best to feed it as soon as possible*, I thought. *After all, the dead have no further use for their flesh. * I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the quiet whimpers of fear and pain. A small whine from behind me made me look up from my grisly feast. I turned to see my daughter staring at me. She had returned to her human shape, but her blazing gold eyes told me she still struggled for control. She was coated with dark red blood just as I was. An observer would be forgiven for thinking she had been hurt, but there was no mistaking the way it stained her lips and face. I folded my ears back in guilt. She was far too young for this. I had hoped to keep the truth hidden from her until she was older. Until she was ready to face the real terrors of the world. I glanced at the dead mercenaries who had taken that chance from me and growled. My daughter gasped at the noise, and I immediately rushed to her side, trying to comfort her even as I knew I was responsible for her fear. I brushed up against her and she grabbed me, pulling me tight into a hug. We fell together onto the bloodstained carpet, with her arms around me and her face buried in the fur on my neck. I whined in concern, but continued to lay still so she had something to hold. I heard her begin to cry. After what seemed an eternity, she loosened her grip on me. I rolled over until I faced her and saw that she had sat up, still rubbing tears from her eyes. I got up gently so as not to scare her, then gently nuzzled her arm. She moved it aside and I began licking her face, trying to clean her as much as comfort her."}

I have started to make a trust fund so that i can visit you someday, and if you could donate to it ( even just a little ) it would help my dream become glorious reality. Love, Achike Abasad, Prince of Nigeria I was furious when I received the email. I had just posted a picture on my Facebook page of my cousin and I together at a beach in California. This `` Prince'', this scammer, had clearly been looking through my personal page and tried to use my cousin against me, staining my memory of the beautiful California sun on my back. Had he *really* thought that I would n't ask my cousin before I gave him *any* money? So though my better judgement advised against extending the interaction, I sent him an angry email in return. He responded. Ms. Lianne, You have discovered me. I am a poor scammer working out of a crumbling office in Nigeria, and the only way I could contact you was through a scam. However, my feelings towards you, my longing to meet you, were all too real. You are a symbol of the love I have never gotten, the luxury I have been denied. Please let me video message you during work. It is strictly forbidden, but it is the only way I can think of to convince you of my good intentions. Love, Achike Abasad, Email Scammer Before I continue, I should tell you that I am an exquisitely lonely person. I inherited my wealth. I fill my time ordering from the pages of Skymall and ladies' magazines. To find interest in me outside of my money or familial connections was intriguing, and the invitation was too good to ignore. I turned on the computer and submitted an invitation to talk through our webcams. He accepted immediately. I saw a set of crooked white teeth smiling before he leaned back from the camera and allowed me to see his whole face. His cheeks were hollow and concave and his hair was lank, but despite this I could see the seeds of attraction. He opened his mouth to speak, but before he did, a nasal voice spoke in heavily accented English from the background. `` You have n't messaged the rich woman yet?

Not that there is n't usually a crowd when His Holiness deigns to show himself to his people. But the everyday prayers of the leader of the Catholic Church do n't draw this kind of crowd... Dignitaries from nearly every First World Nation were in attendance. Celebrities from all walks of life were rubbing elbows with each other in what looked to be a special VIP section. But the biggest, wildest groups were the followers in the middle. There were n't just Catholics and Christians here. Several of the most important rabbis, and sheikhs and imams from the Middle East. The Dalai Lama sent a few of his most trusted monks. Even the Shinto priests had just arrived. There were MILLIONS of people in attendance, all singing and talking and crammed together in and around St. Peter's Basilica. Why, you ask? The Ark of the Covenant. It had finally been found. Now, you got ta understand. In both Christianity and Judaism, the Ark of the Covenant is a pretty big deal, right? It's supposed to contain the tablets upon which God wrote the Ten Commandments for Moses and the bones of some body or something, I do n't know the particulars... But what I DO know is, to put it mildly, the Ark's the single most important find in the history of the world. And today was the day they were going to open it. Note that I said `` supposed to be.'' This is n't a happy story, ladies and gents. Watching all the various people scurrying about, I could n't help but wonder if they knew what they were doing. Everyone knows about how the Ark is supposed to work; they even did it in Indiana Jones! If you open it, you'll die. Simple as that. There's also a lot of fluffy stuff about how religions work because they're based on faith and if you have definitive proof, yadda yadda, no one really cares okay? So the Pope's finished talking and the moment is here. The Ark is... smaller than you'd think. All the Bible stories made it out to be some massive case, adorned with gold and jewels and spiritual hullabaloo. So it was kinda surprising when this simple long box was wheeled out. Looking back, I should have known something was up. But man, it was hard not to let yourself get sucked into the moment, you know what I mean?

Our leaders were on, rationalizing our strategies. Everyone was afraid. I held my children close and I hoped we would die painlessly. That night that they came was full of streaks of red and terror. But then a decision had to be made and we investigated the craters. Through the veils of smoke and in the night and in the day, our shadows covered the indents of our planets. Our bright lights shone in the faces of our doom. And how pitiful were they! How small and incapable were these beings whom had changed the history of Humans forever.

A watershed moment had come, but it had come in our favor. That night that they came had sealed the fate of humanity. It had written history. Through our excuses we justified our torture. We justified our murder. We learned so much, as did they. I still think about how they must have felt, going from the conquerors to feeling pain for the first time. To knowing that they could be killed as easy as cutting fruit. No matter their last thoughts, they died and we gained. We gained the technology to defy light, to defy time and age.

Isabelle gulped nervously, and pressed inward, determined to ensure the health of the occupant. `` I'm not sure what happened, please do n't panic, I'm completely okay Isabelle, I need you to just not freak out, okay?'' A voice blurted all of that out in the span of a few seconds, the speaker clearly worried themself. Isabelle sighed in relief, at least Kat was still there. `` I have no idea what you're talking about, where are you, it's so dark in here,'' Isabelle said idly as her paw felt the wall for the light switch. She flicked it on, and turned back to the room, only to gasp with shock and horror. Kat, who had been a pretty brown wolf villagers, was now very much pink, and very much naked. She had strange paws with very long toes, and all her fur was on top of her head. A quick glance revealed she did n't even have a tail anymore, poor thing. `` I'm still me Isabelle, do n't worry. I mean, I guess worry, but I'm not hurt.'' Kat paced back and forth across the small room, touching furniture as she went. Isabelle's mind raced. There had to be some explanation, something to reason this out. There would be time for that later though, first she needed to figure out how to explain to the other villagers what had happened. Would she say Kat had moved away and this was someone new? They'd need a reason, and a new house, not to mention permits... Well the mayor's position was open and Isabelle already did all the work from when Tortimer was mayor. It would n't take much to convince the villagers they were getting a new mayor.

That slow cancer had come and glaciers of white replaced the buildings, and palpable sorrow had taken over our people. The sky was blue, a pale blue, but there was more light than usual. I had made my way further than I ever had and the ground was untarnished. Supplies were diminishing as this decade turned and I had to go further and further to survive. I was on the outskirts of what had been farm country in some long forgotten dream ago. The ground was uneven. Hills of white rose and a cold wind picked up. Fallen farm houses lay petrified as their wooden bones stuck out. *I am some animal* I thought. *I steal from the dead. * But I had grown used to the thought. I searched the debris and it was all so unfamiliar. This was from a time I had never known. There were things there that I have never heard of or seen before. Then something caught my eye. An old diary lay frozen in the wastes. A collapsed wall still lay upright against the heavy dunes and I was shaded in a long shadow. I picked up the diary and the pages were fragile and mostly disintegrated. What remained was a frost-slick material that was hard to read.

The page I could make out seemed to be written by a small child. I do n't know why I wasted time trying to read it, but all the answers in the world were kept there. Children are often the bravest when fear takes the men. 'Today the monster roared. It was a big roar and it shook our house. He is waking up. It is sunny now and he likes the sun. Mommy used to tell me stories about him. He was asleep for a long time. Now the sun is coming out and he is waking up. I do n't understand. The sun is out everyday. Maybe he was having a long sleep and his mommy and daddy did n't want to wake him. I heard him roar today so I know he is awake. I wonder if mommy will let me see him. I think he is scary but mommy said he was n't. She looks scared herself so I think she was making that part up. I hear him roar again.' I do n't know why it took me."}

It was rather embarrassing, I must admit. And the powers that I had didn \u2019 t help with any of it. After all, being able to spontaneously produce a coconut and cause it to fall and crack open on my head wasn \u2019 t the most popular ability. It was, in almost every way, pretty lame. The only useful part was that my head was slightly harder than a coconut. And so my life went on, everyone else enjoying their more awesome super powers. I continued to be an outcast. And I probably should have stayed one. I didn \u2019 t want to make any enemies, after all. But there came a day that I could no longer take being the social outcast. And that day\u2026 That would be a day that my town would never forget. I was a junior in college and there was a party going on. When I showed up, people wanted nothing to do with me. And so I made my way into my own little corner, which became populated with a lot of good looking women rather quickly. And I found myself in luck when they all wanted some pina coladas. They needed coconuts. And I was just the man to supply them. I also revealed an ability to everyone that I had kept hidden. With the blink of an eye everyone at the party found themselves wearing a coconut bra. And the DJ found his headphones replaced with coconuts. I could fashion any sort of clothing out of coconuts instantly. And then the final party trick that really got everyone loving me. You see, it wasn \u2019 t really the coconut that killed me. It was gravity. And so I loosened the gravity at the party and we all enjoyed the feeling of weightlessness. Needless to say, the rest of the party started to go well for me until the very end. Some of the frat guys didn \u2019 t like how popular I \u2019 d become with the ladies. And I was a tinny bit drunk myself. One of them threw a punch at me. Blood spurted everywhere as they were crushed by an unbearable amount of gravity. A couple other frat guys came at me. Soon everyone around was drenched in blood. A few more minutes passed by and I found myself staring at strange sights. It was becoming apparent that someone had spiked my punch, as I would normally never do such things. Honestly, it \u2019 s hard to remember what I did."}

He smiled at his wife of 63 years, remembering all the happy times they shared. He looked at his children, now with families of their own, and how they continued to bring joy and wellness to the world. Finally, he thought about his contributions to civilization. He had been a structural engineer for most of his life, specializing in tunnels. It sounded mundane, but he had lead multiple projects for the government. He had carved passages through mountains and even got to work on some of the world's most famous subway systems. His name might fade, but his impact would last forever. His wife began to cry, prompting him to turn on his usual charm. \u201c Don \u2019 t be sad, Louise. I had a good run \u201d.

He doesn \u2019 t know how long it was like that, in a dreamlike suspension. However, Charles didn \u2019 t have to wait long before he could feel his body again. First his arms and torso, followed by his legs. Blink twice, just to make sure he still had a head. He was still unsure about his eyes without any light to detect. Then, there was a sudden weight on his body as Charles felt himself standing. This was different, however. He felt strong now, unlike the last ten years where he needed a cane just to walk to the toilet. \u201c Hello? Oh, good. I can still talk and hear, \u201d he said to no one in particular. There was an echo, so he spoke again. \u201c Hello! \u201d Charles recognized that sound. It was an indoor echo.

Also there was no similar-but-different prompt to post it under. ) ____ The gift from Ra gleamed in His holy light, as the great Pharaoh observed the orb which fell from the heavens. After some time, small cracks began to appear upon the face of the orb. Pharaoh was afraid, fearing that his lack of true reaction to the gift had angered Great Ra, but his priests assured him that this was merely the gift following its path. The orb opened, and within was a child. An infant, about the age of the young prince. `` So, it is Ra's will,'' intoned Pharaoh before the assembled crowd, `` that my son shall have a brother. A gift from Ra himself, in the wake of my queen's passing into the arms of Nephthys.'' And so it was that Kal-Ra ( so named for the scrawling in the inside of the orb, naming the child Kal, and for his nature as a gift from Ra ) was raised as second in line to take the throne when the great Pharaoh would pass. His brother, son-by-blood of Pharaoh, who was named Khufu, was of course first in line. So too, as they grew older, was Khufu first in the priestess Chay-ara's heart. For all Kal-Ra's gifts, and for all his efforts to win the heart of the priestess, still she chose Khufu. For this, Kal-Ra grew jealous of his brother. He hid his feelings well, for the Pharaoh's sons were raised as to be stoic, strong, and firm. But feel he did. As the years passed, and Khufu and Chay-ara grew closer outside of Pharaoh's view ( for great though he was, his view did have its limits ), Kal-Ra was approached by the priest Hath-Set. It was Hath-Set's belief, which we may know as we are not a part of this tale, that he would be able to manipulate Kal-Ra to strike down Prince Khufu, then himself strike down Kal-Ra in secret, that he might possess the heart of Chay-ara. Kal-Ra, however, was smarter than Hath-Set, and so he turned the situation back on the priest. In his cunning way, Hath-Set offered Kal-Ra a gift: a small green stone which had been found at the young adopted prince's landing site. The moment Kal-Ra grasped the stone, he began to weaken. Hath-Set had poisoned him! What had this treacherous priest done?"}

They face an incoming swarm of Reeks. They fear nothing. They collectively do not feel anything. They are a slime ridden, filthy breed of insect-creatures, only have the size of the Constabilis. But, ever since the `` Great Swarm,'' no civilization has been safe. JurTillquinn is one of the Constabilis, an ancient, formerly sleeping race of guardians, nestled in the caverns of the cliffs in the north. It is cold here, where the usual beings can not live. But, in the hundreds of years since the Constabilis slept, the world changed around them. The Terrains, smaller, weaker, and less adaptable than the Constabilis, grew into power. Eventually, truth became myth, and the Terrains grew mighty with knowledge. They dug deep into the world, seeking the oceans, looking for more worlds to conquer. Technology became their focus. No longer did the Terrains have the ability to think independently - they all had built-in devices pressed along their spinal cord. But, they dug too deep, and they woke another race. The Reeks as they were called by the Constabilis infested and killed all who stood in their way. They did not care for technology, knowledge, or love. They crawled and sucked the life out of everything they could. Yet, there was one place their collective mind knew it needed to conquer once and for all: the Northern Cliffs. Yet, one Terrain, given a message by the last leaders huddled in an island near the Northern Cliffs, was given a message to awaken the Constabilis. That Terrain was Niles. Eventually, he would be the last of the race. After finding the Hall of HultenZor, he implanted a device into the doorway, which had awoken the General of the Constabilis. No one, not even his own kind, knew his name. He was massive, dark-skinned, and unique. All of the Constabilis had great size and darker skin tones, but he had something none of them had: the ability to speak. The Constabilis long gave up their ability to speak when they made a sacrifice many eons ago to give up their ability to speak if they could save the Terrain race from utter annihilation by their rivals. They lived without fear ever since. JurTillquinn understood, along with the others, what his General was saying. They abided to their oath to never speak. They knew the gravity of the situation. As the swarm of Reeks came up over the snow and ice of the Northern Cliffs' bay, the Constabilis prepared. Their hearts did not beat fast. They did not fear the Reeks."}

I approached the back and saw something small covered in dust. This thing was n't like the others. It was not copper, nor bronze, nor iron or steel.

Although I never saw this man before, I could hear his name screaming in my mind. *Goliath* My arm started spinning the weapon and released one side of the rope, launching one of the stones square in the giant's forehead. Goliath toppled dead to the ground. When I came to, I was shaking and sweating. Outside I could here sirens and people yelling. I grabbed the sling and stones and ran outside.

The plan was simple, drop in Brandenburg, behind enemy lines, to do recon for an eventual push through to Berlin. The drop went as planned. However, a large gust of wind pushed me into the trees causing me to get stuck without any way of giving the rest of the squad my position. The trek though the forest, even though a 10 minute hike, felt as if a whole week in hell. To my suspicions I was alone, but it was then that I awoke something from deep in the woods that should not have been disturbed. It played in the shadows cast by the moon across the trees. It moved only when I did, echoing my footsteps. It could smell my fear, and it was feeding off of it. As I emerged into the clearing where my rally point was my squad teased me with how pail I was. `` Geese, Stone! You look like you just saw a ghost!'' Murphy pointed out. `` Yeah, afraid of trees, John?'' Miller joked, not so funny now are you? `` Need a drink, boy'o?'' Callahan, our medic, tried to calm me down a bit. too bad he's not here now. `` I got a flagon of the good stuff, Stone'' Moreno was the squad drunk. Maj. Philips did n't much care for him, but he was good to me. `` Hey, let me have a swig!'' The Rookie requested. `` When you're older, kid'' Robertson was the word of reason, aside from Philips `` Alright cut the chatter,'' Major Anthony G. Philips led our Kitchen-sink outfit of men into the cold of the night, `` and let's get to the task at hand. The nearest Nazi camp is about 8 clicks north of here so if we start moving now we can recon by dawn and get a good read on their morning routines.'' It was here where we entered the realm of the beast. The first to go was Murphy, Cpl. Joesph H. Murphy, he lagged behind most of the group all the time. His excuse for this was he was just watching out for the rest of the squad, but we all knew it was because of him being overweight. Miller called it to our attention by calling out into the the darkness for him. `` Murph! Hey, Murphy!"}

Now that I'm thinking about it, my guide was quite a strange looking creature. A large barracuda that wiggled as it's long sexy legs carried it forward, as if he did n't know he was n't swimming. Yeah, the legs were pretty sexy. Finally, we came to a clearing. I looked up and saw the sky for the first time in what seemed like forever, a deep blue with cotton white clouds. The clearing itself was a big circle, completely empty and with a dirt ground. The dense jungle surrounded the clearing on all sides. My guide turned to me, `` Wait here until the watcher's arrive.'' A giant worm then descended from the sky attached to a line, my guides eye's grew wide. `` THAT'S MINE!'' it let out with a Darwinian passion, taking a big chomp on the worm before letting out an agonizing scream, `` IT WAS A TRAP!'' The line then rose back into the sky, the barracuda's pained screams audible long after he had disappeared from sight. Weird. I went to the middle of the clearing and popped a squat, wondering how long it would take for the'lookers' or whatever to arrive. My question was instantly answered. A brown hand burst through the ground and motioned for me to come over. I walked over, as i got closer i realized that the hand itself was made out of dirt. When I got sufficiently close, the hand put it's palm up as if it wanted to hold hands. Why not? I grabbed it. Nothing happened. It leg go and gave me a thumbs down symbol, before putting it's palm out again. I grabbed it and pulled, pulling some sort of dirt creature out of the ground; it was coughing and spitting up dirt. When it was done gagging on soil it turned to me with a displeased face, `` You're not the brightest are you? Do n't answer that.'' He spit a big chunk of dirt to the ground and then locked his dark brown eyes on my bright blue, `` Well, it looks like you're the only one here, so you must be him.

Strange how quite the city is this late Monday. The park is covered in a light dew still smelling faintly of summer's sun. I take my place on that bench, rusty and worn, I've known so well. The first passes. A beautiful woman, in a patterned dress. It's beautiful. Her lips shimmer red, and her hair the faintest of auburn; it shimmers like threads of gold in today's light. She walks by before I can even see her face. Who knows how she lives today. He crosses her path briskly. A cracked smile and ruffled hair. His is dark brown like his eyes. They are fixed on some nothing off in the distance. Like that they've walked out of my world and off into their own. A gentleman stops by. He asks if the seat beside me is taken; of course not. His brilliant green eyes smile at mine knowingly. `` How do you feel today,'' he inquires, `` do you understand why yet?'' As he says this a group of children on a school trip rush by in a flurry of maroon uniforms. Their exasperated teacher yells after them, her face pink with exertion. I do n't understand why at all. `` Today is the best day, is n't it?'' the man prods again. I do n't think it is. Today is the worst day yet even. But so was yesterday. It just keeps getting worse. No motivation to get away from it at all. `` Do n't believe me? I'm a doctor after all, my judgement is trusted by those far and wide. What do you think of this morning?'' What do I think of this morning? It's new. Fresh. It's something posed still, like a painting on a wall. Beautiful and organic. I ready my reply, and each word falls out of my mouth with a faint ding. `` Today is a day unlike any other before. I guess that's a beautiful thing in and of itself.''

Long had we imagined we would choke the earth of its resources, that we had perhaps already set into motion the destruction of our home planet. And so we set forth into the skies, several seed ships, each equipped & manned & stocked with our greatest minds, repositories of knowledge, gene-banks, self-replicating nano-builder units, from which could be rebuilt all the wonders our technocracy had wrought -- or from which we could grow new earth-like ecosystems. Most of these ships had set course light-years beyond the solar system. Generation after generation, ships carrying descendants of their original crews would be caught up to by ships launched after those descendants' birth; every few years propulsion had made such huge leaps that we were finding the capacity to catch up to, and pick up our fore-bearers, loading them, their data records and their cargo into upgraded next-gen seed ships. -- Their abandoned state-of-the science derelicts would have their trajectory set to return them to an earth orbit, so that the homeworld could scrap them for parts and get the data recorded by these ships' travels... eventually...

Some Pure-Earth conspiracy theorists would occasionally put forth the claim that the launches were a huge hoax, that the crews were people selected for population control. One could hardly blame people for being sensationalists. Here we had supposedly mastered space technology & kept devoting generation after generation to pouring our most advanced tech & people & resources into seed-ship production, yet the global infrastructure was simply falling apart.

The great Elven Kingdoms had lasted a thousand generations and none knew of men as anything more than raiders and thieves and so it had always been. In the time after the Third Great War there was much change across the land. The citadels of the Orkfolk were changing, forced to adapt by the peace treaties and the conditions they had places on both the Orkfolk and their Gods. No longer could the great Ork Father Kraa sit in High Murgon and dictate to the Orkfolk how he wished them to war and die, now he was shackled in the Silver Tower, held captive by the united Elven and Dwarf pantheons. He was a guarantee against the behaviour of his people and without his warlike influence they were to last taking to the world. With this change in power came other alterations in the structures of the world though, changes that none could have predicted. With the loosening of Kraa \u2019 s grip, the Ork watchers, who had long guarded against human invasion and indeed had revelled in their guard, were at last relaxed. The Patrols lessened, the towers were abandoned and in a few short years, even the great walls had begun to crumble. But the humans did not come. In the North Wastes, in the place beyond the cold, where humankind had been forced to scratch an existence, a fire was finally burning which could not be extinguished by snow or water. The fire was instead growing more powerful by the day. In the lands to the South the summer brought prosperity and without the threat of war from Orkkind, the elven and Dwarf lands opened themselves to trade and peace. Swords were lost and forgotten and tales of the old wars were told to scare children, but none expected to see them again in their time. They spoke of the second war, where the Elven Kingdoms had first grown, near thousand years ago and thrown back the Ork and Dwarf Kingdoms. They sang of the third war, where the Orks had waged a battle that left scars across the land, as they sought to reclaim what they saw as their lands; but none sun of the first war. The first war was in a time before stories and only existed as a faint memory, almost a fairytale as it involved beasts of fancy, machines of metal and fire and death beyond count."}

Anyone else who was going to stand in my way had just been warned that their certain doom was approaching. I had already vanquished my foes in the other 9 castles of the other 9 worlds. I thought to myself, `` Surely I will find Princess Peach in this castle.'' Of course, I had said that about the 9 other castles, but I was still optimistic about her being in this one. I approached the door to the boss's chamber. Even though I knew King Bowser himself was probably in there, I felt more confident than ever. I opened the door to the boss's room and went inside. The boss's room was strangely ordinary, with a just a flat floor and flat walls. I looked around for King Bowser because I did n't see him at first. After a second or two, I looked down a little and noticed an ordinary goomba. It was almost insulting that there was nothing special about this goomba. He did n't have wings, large size, or anything to present a significant challenge. I could n't believe this. I ran toward him and jumped on his head. As soon as I landed squarely on his head, he disappeared from existence. Then, the door to the next room opened. I went in there looking for Princess Peach. Instead I found a Toad who told me, `` Sorry Mario. The princess is in another castle.'' Not again!"}

He had never seen his own amount of time fall below 48 hours before, yet there on his arm, the digital display clearly read 00:00:040:37:21... 20... 19. These days it was rare for at least one, or two, maybe even three tabs of Don's internet browser not to be open to Reddit, constantly checking back to see if that small number next to his username had gone up. DonKeeHoTeh. He had come up with what he thought at the time was a cool username. Maybe it still was. At this point, he did n't really care. It only reminded him of simpler times, when Reddit was fun, and engaging, but disposable. That was then. Now Reddit had grown... morphed entirely into something else entirely... God, had 2016 been that long ago? It felt like an eternity ago, but that's always how it feels when you're glancing at a clock every 5 minutes, is n't it? *ping* The soft alert sounded, but it was a sound Don had subconsciously learned to react to instantaneously, waking him from a light sleep he had n't realized he had drifted into. The computer pinged a second time. It was a wonderful sound, the sound Reddit made whenever your karma increased. Since the takeover, Reddit had begun an alert system. The ping sounded whenever your karma had increased in increments of 100, 500, or 1,000. Don was told it sounded at 5,000 and 10,000 as well, but he had never had a posting that warranted such an alert. He glanced quickly at the still-open laptop next to him on the couch. 6:27am. it had been 3 hours to the minute since he last had looked at Reddit. The room around him was growing slowly lighter. He looked quickly at his arm, and gave a small sigh of relief. The display read 00:00:373:37:48. Both of the posts from the previous night must have hit 1,000, he thought. That's a week a piece. Not too bad. It almost made up for the fact he had snuck those photos of her while she was changing. r/gonewild was more popular than ever, and the `` unsuspecting'' look was what the masses were craving. She had seen him take the photo... at first she had been mad, even threatened to leave. But Don had coaxed her out of the idea, telling her she really was his everything in life, that she was his love. She had calmed down and gone to bed, but Don could n't sleep."}

The paper ball bounced off his head and the girl behind him giggled as his face flashed red behind his `` History of Man'' textbook. `` As I was saying, major advances and discoveries drive civilizations to conquer and flourish. Can anyone name one that changed the world? Annie?'' Annie started awake, and voiced a guess. `` Uh, Science?'' `` Earlier.'' `` Weapons?'' `` Weapons, there we go!''

The magical energies in the room sometimes left a quite literal hypnotic effect. `` Weapons changed the world as the ancients knew it,'' I continued, `` but before the spear, who could have imagined anything beyond hand to hand contact? How could one comprehend something such as the sword, or the gun? Next came writing- ideas could be shared, advancements recorded, information abound. Who could hold that idea in their mind? To anyone before their time, these ideas seemed ridiculous. Laughable. And what come next, Annie?'' `` Uh, Science?'' She guessed again. I felt a small pricking at the back of my head, and knew she was trying to guess my thoughts. Literally. `` Correct! Science was but a hobby before it became useful. Most considered it a waste of time and money, or a rich man's game. Then look what it did!'' I flicked my hands, and chalk began dancing across the board, `` Television, airplanes, medical advances, robotics, all these benefits- then near extinction as the Earths resources faltered and technology grew stronger than man himself. And the only thing that saved mankind from technology was something few actually believed existed, and most thought was folley. What was that, Annie?'' She did n't need to pick my brain to know the answer of this one. `` Magic.'' `` Yes, magic. The insignificant, imaginary hobby left only to those society discarded, let man travel through the stars. It was something we could n't sense, could never guess, and could n't grasp. But look at us now.''

I was not, however, used to what was to come later that day. It was an average Monday morning, sunny and welcoming, yet still had too many birds chirping. `` I swear, it's like these d*mn birds' life goals are to wake me up every morning.'' I mumbled, getting out of bed to complete my morning routine. Once I had finished everything that had to be done, I started walking to work. While walking, I decided to listen to various songs on my phone. The first song that played happened to be `` Super Hero.'' I softly hummed along, continuing to get to work. The song ended just in time, as I had just arrived in front of the giant office building. Sighing, I walked inside to continue my daily routine. The day has gone by relatively quickly, considering that I had dreamed of being a hero but ended up working for a villain. As I was about to leave, my boss called me into his office. `` Hello?'' I asked, slowly walking into his office. `` Is something wrong, Matthew?'' Calling my boss by his first name had become normal for me, as I had been called into his office more times than any of my coworkers had. `` Take a seat, May.'' I did as I was told, nervously awaiting what Matthew had to say. `` You're aware of the fact that one of the workers here has been thinking of becoming a hero, am I right?'' I nodded my head, hoping that he had no idea who this person was. `` Well, do you know who this person is?'' Knowing that I was as good as dead by now even if I did say something, I decided to stay silent. Matthew looked at me expectantly, as if he already knew the answer is give him.

The incredible feeling when you rise above the ground, watching your shadow grow smaller and smaller below. I never thought of the end as I watched mountains rise and oceans fill. It took countless years for them to settle to their current size and place. The waves... I will miss them too. The sound of waves breaking around me while I rested on the shore. Not even now, as I feel the void slowly engulf what remains of me do I think of the end. I think of the stars, the ones that shone long before I came to the world, and the ones that will remain in the skies long after I am gone. How many others are out there, I ca n't help but wonder? Others like me, my brothers whom I will never meet, busy turning their own chaotic worlds into something good. The stars remain with me, stalwart to the end, the only ones to witness the last few breaths that I will ever draw. Seems only fair, I suppose. The night is at its darkest at last. The moment I've been waiting for. Finally, the time has come for me to do a last act of service for this world I grew so fond of. I never imagined what the end would look like.

All I wanted was to bring back the Lord and Master for Earth's Final Reckoning. Not a big ask! And yet it's taken me thirty years to find the necessary books amidst the chaotic dark magic libraries. Those are hard enough to find, hidden beneath the basements of old French hospitals or in the hidden coves of Indian burial grounds. I've traveled the world in search of the answers to Life and Death, but now. Now, I hold the key in my hands, bound in blood and leather. The conditions required for the ceremony are as I would expect; a full moon, 5 black candles, a meeting point on the crossing of ley lines, and apparently the semen of a virile man. I'm not sure about the last element, but I'm sure all will become clear. I sit on the cold earth in the centre of the elaborate platform I have drawn in virgin spilled blood, with the book in front of me, and chant the words I have learnt in the dead of night for weeks, until they could roll off my tongue like quicksilver as they do now. The candles drip where they burn with green flames and the wax runs onto the grass, cooling instantly in the misty air. Moonlight shines on my face, breaking out from cloud, at the moment I finish chanting. Everything is going exactly to plan, second to second as the book describes. Now comes the, well, more strange element, but who am I to second guess old dark magic? I drink the semen from the crystal vial, mixed with my own blood. Nothing happens. I drop the glass to the ground and flick through the book with shaking fingers. This is n't right! The world should have `` turned upside down and dragged the cruel fingers of Life through my body'', then `` borne the Dead from the legs of the Caster''. The Lord has not returned. There is no body rising from at my feet, no clawing at the soil. I feel nothing, no sensation expect roiling panic. This is useless, the book must be wrong, too old for proper magic working. I stand up, adjusting my balls where the material of my ceremonial robes has rubbed and itched against them. My feet feel swollen and sore and my legs shake, most likely from sitting for such a long time. I'm famished from the spell work as well - I need some chocolate to re-energise me."}

They'd never been able to have children, despite years of trying.

He finishes in a few minutes, and he already has his evening planned. The same evening he's had for the past 2 years.

Hence my username. I literally learned about NaNo this morning, and I do n't think I have enough time to bang out 50k words at an also-recently-learned typing speed of 45 wpm. I use Google Docs to write, mostly because I can access it from anywhere and it saves instantly. I do n't have anything to promote, as I've never finished anything long-term that I've written. I *do* have one novel at about 47 % and 80-90k words, but it's still not there.

Really great sub, and an underutilized tool IMO. To get into the writing zone, I wait for inspiration to strike. Then I find a quiet place, and hammer it out.

He looked amused. `` Pray tell, what is it that you wish for?'' I had given this a long thought. I took a deep breath and yelled, `` I want every guy in the world to be obsessed with you!'' A silence rang through the canyon as Isaac Newton raised an eyebrow. `` You want what?'' I gave him a sheepish grin. `` I want every guy in the world to be obsessed with you, and the opposite reaction of that-'' I waved my finger through the air. ``... is that every girl in the world will be obsessed with me.'' Newton thought for a moment and seemed to have figured it out. `` So THAT'S how you think it works...'' he chuckled, `` Makes sense.'' `` Damn straight,'' I put my hand on my waist, `` Let's make it happen.'' A flash of light and a voice boomed in my head. **DONE** I gasped awake as several of my classmates had been staring at me. `` Is there a problem?'' the professor was looking at me, `` Mr. Smith?'' *Smith, that's my name. * `` No sir,'' I wiped my head of the sweat, `` I'm doing well... uh Professor....'' `` Professor Isaac Newton Brown,'' he answered, `` Are you feeling alright?'' *Oh, it would make sense it he was named that because....* `` Wait, then that means...'' I eyed the room of all the females. Several of them were staring at me. `` If you do n't mind,'' Prof. Brown cleared his throat, `` I would like to continue the lesson.'' `` No, go right on ahead sir,'' I apologized, `` Sorry about that.'' I was jittery in my seat for the rest of class. Afterwards, I began to look for my prey. *Not her... not her... nope... * I found her - Melissa Greene. The hottest girl in the grade. She also played for the volleyball team as a librero. I walked up to her. `` Hey.'' A sharp pain hit my face as I fell onto the floor. I lost consciousness for a second as I found myself looking up at her from the ground. `` Wha- `` Do n't you **fucking** touch me,'' she gritted her teeth, `` Or I will kill you.'' She spat on me as I felt the saliva hit my forehead. She turned away and walked away. *What the fuck? * I turned to another nearby girl."}

He felt as if he were now part of the inanimate blue plastic chair situated on the gray tiles of the floor of the high school's computer lab. All that moved was his train of thought through the loop of thinking he could not derail from. Over and over he ran through what would follow his actions. All he could imagine was being torn away from the life he was familiar with. Where he would be taken and what would be done with him he had not concluded. He managed to rotate his head around to scan the small room which was filled with five rows of nine computers all facing a white brick wall, with a desk at their backside and a door also on their backside in the wall to their right close to the corner, himself sitting in the center of the center row. First to the left down the row of unattended computers glowing with their identical log in screens and further left behind him to the unattended desk where a supervisor would sit if the school were open. Rotating to the right he observed the wall at the end of the row of computers where a white poster with black text establishing basic rules for computer use hung and further right to the door with the intimidating box above it marked `` EXIT'' in glowing red. He centered his focus back on the computer he had been occupying for the past three hours. His bony, pale face showed great strain and was highlighted by the sweat the rolled down it as it was illuminated by the screen in front of him as he typed and clicked ferociously with his scrawny, long hands to save the monumental work on to a flash drive. He finalized his actions by ripping the flash drive out of the computer and standing up all in one motion before putting the flash drive in his pocket and crawling under the table. He hastily tore the plug of his computer from the power strip and plugged it back in. Crawling out and standing back up in the aisle he had occupied previously he paused and took a deep breath with his eyes beaming on the exit sign. Following a slow exhale he darted through the aisle and made his way to the exit door."}

With a groan, I wiped the drowsiness from my eyes and got out of bed. Tyler must have brought over one of his girlfriends again. I admit that if I had been as good-looking as him I'd take advantage of it too, but did he have to be so loud about it? I wearily stumbled out of my room, taking a glance at the digital clock as I approached Tyler's bedroom. Why was he up and at it at 6:66 in the morning? And since when was 6:66 a time? It was too early to deal with that- probably just a glitch. Or something. The moans and thunks continued as I approached the door. Goodness, she must really have been getting into it. I almost decided to just forget about it- but I had to go to work in three hours and I needed that sleep. Tyler's lovemaking, however passionate and rambunctious, could wait. I rapped on the door a few times and all the noises stopped completely. Well, mission accomplished. I was halfway back to my room when Tyler's door opened. `` Dude,'' I started, turning around, `` It's fine, just quie-'' It was n't Tyler. It was his girlfriend. What's more, her skin was a pale green, her clothes were stained with blood, and her eyes swiveled around disjointedly in sunken sockets. Oh, and did I mention that she was carrying Tyler's disembodied, profusely bleeding head along with her? I froze in place as her eyes locked on to me. This was it. I was going to die. Paralyzed, I watched as Tyler's girlfriend- at least, what used to be Tyler's girlfriend- began to sprint towards me in a frenzied gait, arms extended and mouth wide with a toothy grin. Tyler's head bumped against the wall - \\*thump\\*. For some reason, that was what kickstarted my fight or flight response. Screaming, I ran to the front door and flung it wide open, pursued by the terrifying creature that Tyler's girlfriend had somehow become. As I got outside, the ground began to shake- an earthquake? Now, of all times? I tripped on the stairs and fell onto my hands and knees, but curiously enough, the monster did n't take the opportunity to pounce on me. I turned to see it struggling against a gigantic tentacle that seemed to be reaching out of a portal that floated in the air. What the hell was going on? Deciding not to look the gift horse in the mouth, I recovered and frantically sped down the road. There had to be somebody that could help me. My neighbors?"}

Even if it could n't stop right then and there, it should've stayed in the park. Uncle Raymond did n't have to announce an after party at the beach, but given how long it's been since I've seen him, I could only expect him to pull some crap like this. He knows I saw the way he kept eyeballing my fiancee. He looked me in the eye during the Electric Slide, thrusting behind her without her noticing. That old fool was trying to awaken a drive in me, get the blood boiling. I fought that urge and won without problems. But hell, the whole family was out to get me. Momma and Pops had most of the meat at the buffet delivered to the table I was sitting at, setting up a whole platter of it just for me. `` Boy's got ta get his strength up,'' Pops said, giving a wink and smile. `` That vegetarian shit he got goin' on, it's doin' him no favors.'' Denise, my fiancee, just laughed it off. She patted me on the chest. `` I got your son covered. He's doing just fine.'' Momma leaned down and started wagging her finger. `` You ca n't go the rest of your life on greens alone, baby. You got ta up the protein or else he'll pass out.'' `` I'd say we're faring fine as is, Ma,'' I said. Momma just shrugged, but pushed the plate just a little further. My parents stayed where they stood, talking amongst the other family at the table. I knew they were n't leaving until I ate what they served, so I gave them what they wanted. It's been a long time since I let soul food down my gullet, and while I never missed it, I did n't mind it. Everything else the family did to test me was more subtle, but my parents and Raymond were the most explicit. They were broken up at their little Tony going up to New York from the Virginia backwoods to make a name for himself. They thought I was abandoning them for good, even though I swore I'd come back. They just never expected such a change in me, and were trying their damnedest to retreat down Memory Lane with me on their heels if they had to. At the end of the day, that's how it went. At the beach, right as the sun was going down, I got the gist of just what they wanted me to do. I knew at first, but putting two and two together kicked in like the kick was aimed at my gut."}

The look on his face was the exact same that night he killed my wife and only child. It was the look of despair. You might be wondering why I did n't give the cops an accurate description so that this bastard would have been caught. It's a simple answer. It's because I've known this man all my life. Of course I would know who he is because he's my older brother. When he stormed into my house that night, I was sleeping on the couch. I was jolted awake by the sudden loud noise. Luckily I left the lights on so I saw his face. He paled when he saw mine. `` Dear god, I prayed it was n't going to be your house.'' I did n't understand what he meant. At least not at the moment. Me and my older brother Thomas had never been close. He left home with mom right after high school and I have n't seen him or my mother since. It came to a bit of a shock when he appeared in my house that night with a shotgun in his hands. `` What the hells wrong with you?'' I yelled at him. Not because he had just broken down my door, but because of all the time that had passed. Not one phone call or birthday card. He did n't even show up to my wedding which was a few years back. His eyes turned red as if he was about to tear up. He shook his head and pushed me out the way. `` I'm sorry, Tim, but I have to do this.'' He stormed into seven year old daughters room and shot her dead in her bed. Not one time, not two times, but at least six times. I stood horrified as I watched my daughter die. My wife stormed out of our room and screamed. I did n't hesitate as Thomas turned the gun on her. I grabbed Thomas gun making him miss the shot at my wife. `` You crazy motherfucker!'' I cried out as a punched him square in his mouth. He stumbled back, but not very far. I was not the athletic child. `` Get out of the way!'' He yelled back at me, brandishing a long knife from the inside of his coat jacket. He pushed me aside and turned back towards my wife. Maybe it was just the height of the moment or maybe I did n't want to see, but the woman who Thomas had charged was n't my wife."}

The possibility existed, and knew the man would n't let up until it was discussed. `` You would be the first, Stephen. The absolute first human subject with which this machine will be tested. We have only theories what its effect will be. We have delayed trials because we fear the transfer will cause death, before the subjects mind can be downloaded.'' His look was one of excitement, fear far from his focus. A chance. A way out. `` Even better. If I croak I'll get a sentence in the history books.

It was the beginning of fall, leaves were changing color, the air was crisp, and the cold feeling in my fingers made me feel alive for the first time in a long time. Elated I ran back to my dorm, I was excited to tell George about my decision. I raced up the stairs and flung the door wide only to see a silent room. The door to the washroom was locked, I knocked and knocked but there was no reply. There was a soft thud, like something hit the edge of the bathtub, and I knew he was in there. I called the RA, they called the campus police, and they called the RCMP. George was pronounced dead on arrival when they finally got him to the hospital. He bled out from a horribly deep cut. The doctors said it appeared to be self inflicted. I moved on, I guess. We never were really friends. I moved out of the dorm and slowly I became more involved in campus life.

Although they were required to do so under their employment contract, Sir Richard liked to think they at least looked at him with pity, if not a swelling compassion, and that their assurances were genuine. Such emotions were luxuries the rich had no time to enjoy. A few steps further and the guard spoke again. `` We're going to knock on the front door now, my Lord.'' Sir Richard nodded his head violently, eyes scrunched up. He felt the guards tender hands cover his ears, and press tight, creating a suction of pressure. They were so close that he inhaled her perfume. Hibiscus, he guessed. `` Is he ready?'' The other guard questioned. He could hear the dull and uncaring tone in her voice. `` Ready.'' The stern guard grabbed the large brass knocker and rammed it once against the door. A staggered noise of terror escaped Sir Richard. The scented guard held tight as he pulled her down into a squat. He could hear his heart pump like one of those antiquated steamboats paddling at full power. He could here hers too, imploring him to set his beat by her own. He heard the ripping of velcro, and sure enough a brown paper bag crinkled against his mouth. `` Breath, my Lord.'' `` Oh, for heaven's sak-'' The main door creaked open. `` Ah, Sir R-rich... ard! W-w-wonder... ful.'' A reed of a man in the same state of finery as Sir Richard cowered in the doorway.

He briefly considered turning and running home anyways, but he remembered from the stories that things did not usually turn out well for those who refused the God's calls to action. Cowardice was obviously not a trait that the God favored in his chosen ones. With seemingly no other option, Dexton reluctantly walked into the dragon's cave. *Well then, God, please let me survive this. I'll be more entertaining to you alive than dead. I swear it. Please, God, give me a sign that you mean for me to live. `` * Once more, Dexton waited for a sign. Several minutes passed, and when none came Dexton continued to descend into the dark. Suddenly, he heard a roar. Even though he could n't see far into the inky blackness, knew it was the dragon. Shivers ran down his spine, and a knot formed in his stomach. From somewhere else in the cavern, he heard a woman's voice. The princess, he presumed. As his eyes adjusted to the dim light, he saw her. She had glossy dark hair and piercing blue eyes, and despite the fact that she had been chained to a rock for several weeks, her beauty had been supernaturally preserved. Despite his fear, Dexton could n't help but roll his eyes. He had heard enough folklore to know that this God could be very predictable."}

His companion and closest friend for all those years, Christof, grabbed him roughly by the arm, \u201c I... I... It ca n't be real, can it? \u201d Harold contemplated silently, looking at the fear in Christofs eye. Although only 6 days seperated them in age, Christof was slight in stature, no more than a child, with a wisp of a blonde beard on his chin, his long blonde hair braided down his back. They had been told the tales of Gn'arr for as long as they could remember, spending nights shivering around the warm fire while their fathers had laughed and drank, recounting tales of this fabled creature, green scales shimmering as it lay scorn to villages similar to theirs for hundreds of years. As they grew older they believed it less and less and would join in with the laughter, sharing mead between them. \u201c I fear we must return to the village Christof. This is a dark omen \u201d The two boys silently packed up their gear, each buckling their shields to their back and shouldering their spears.

I could n't even tell you what i was doing up it, but i remember the *whoosh* in my stomach as the legs slipped and my life was snuffed out. A lot of you will be wondering what it felt like. Most of you wo n't have felt it, after all. Humans die in all kinds of ways, but most of them just sort of... go to sleep. They drift off, and all they can remember is darkness followed by this place. When i died the lights faded out. First the colour drained, and then the light became darkness as the shadow envelopped the sky. I remember seeing a cloud float by and wonder why it was so sluggish. But instead of darkness, the world faded into a an opaque brown mist. A dampness spread along my body, a cold clammy grasp that struck me as familiar. My mouth filled with it, and spurted out of my nose into more of the dark brown material. When something terrible is happening to us, the mind has a remarkable ability to shut itself off and pretend like it's happening to someone else. That would've been nice. Instead of shrinking of consciousness my mind began thinking thoughts of mud. I tasted soil, smelt earth. My ears rang with the scratching of pebbles, the squelching of organic matter as it settled deeper into the rot. I did not observe these changes in myself, i simply *was*. The thought of moving my limbs was irrelevant, as i flexed a million earthworms and stretched the countless legs of countless arthropods. In that death i became life, to a degree that i had never experienced as a human. It was awesome and terrible. The constant movement, the endless trickling as death settled onto more death and squeezed out life, was dizzying. My eyes were multiple, and all showed me a mosaic of mosaics, each tile a different part of the rot. As you know i came here. We all have. I can hear by the drip of the water that we are in the same room as when i started this tale. I can tell by your rustling that there are more of you. More of you to remember my words, and tell them to others. After awakening into this chamber lay there for some unknown amount of time. I drifted between wakefulness and that other state. I felt the funghi grow over my skin, felt my body begin to sink back into the mud. I felt water, pooled onto my eyes. I felt my breath, moving over my lips."}

That was the problem with old age. Things got weaker and it became harder and harder just to move around. Enjoying the simple things in life was something that I \u2019 d learned long ago, and persistence was one of the simple things that people had forgotten. There was a satisfaction from eating healthy and cleansing your body of toxicants the natural way; doing exercise to build resilience; getting wisdom from becoming that bit more frail and weary, rather than just relying on the ReStart\u2122. It was something that took me at least seventy years to figure out. Finally though I was released from my contractual obligations to repay CloneGen. I \u2019 d finally paid back the twenty-million price-tag that I \u2019 d accumulated from all my ReStarts\u2122. They would now allow me to age beyond bio-fifty all by myself. No more forcible ReStart\u2122 for me for being in debt, thank you very much. It was just as good that my time was over. The world around me was getting more and more disgusting by the minute and I didn \u2019 t have the life left in me to try and keep up anymore. It seemed as if people put all their effort into looking exactly perfect, being as fit and healthy as possible for when they turned twenty-five, but all of that determination and drive went out the window when they got the ReClone\u2122. I mean you \u2019 d be stupid to not make yourself the best you could be once you went for your ReBase\u2122. Every time you got a ReStart\u2122 you wanted to have the best advantage possible. But it was critical to hold onto at least some of that determination and drive to still become a better person. Your ReBase\u2122 wasn \u2019 t the best person that you could be. But everyone had seemed to forget that. Sometimes I thought that I was one of the few sane people left in the modern world. Perhaps one of the only ones left since the early days of ReClone\u2122. It had taken me seventy years to get from twenty-five years old to fifty years old. Well forty nine years and three hundred and sixty days bio age to be exact. I think. It had been so long since a birthday meant anything to me that I kind of didn \u2019 t remember when it was anymore."}

Just as the 15:26 came into view. `` Right on time.'' As we pass under the bridge, the missiles curl upwards and hit the underside. The multiple explosive impacts cause the track to buckle upwards and snap as bridge debris rains down behind us. The train behaves as trains always do when this happens, ramping and gliding into a perfect midair collision with the helicopter, engulfing both in a colossal fireball.

My passenger is in awe. I always love this part. I watch his face in the mirror as it starts to go through the usual stages of shock and disbelief. `` H- how did- but...'' Completely speechless. They always are. I give him his cue. `` This is the bit where you say I'm no ordinary cab driver.'' `` But... missiles...'' A bit slow on the uptake. `` Standard issue. No, you did n't get my car by accident. We're a more specialised operation and we keep very close tabs on... people like you.''

Once upon a time, there was many of us. Billions, all across land just like ours. And we lived in harmony - to an extent. Sure, there was a few squabbles, but we were happy. Trade flourished, people were educated and had jobs, there was little violence. Things were good. But then, they attacked. Out of nowhere, another Government - strong in both military and economy - declared war on the world. Governments fought back - ours included - but it was a losing battle. No matter how many men, money, and technology we threw at them, they responded with double as much. The bloodshed was unimaginable. And, so, our Government of the time made a decision. They chose to go dark. Our military was withdrawn, and those who were in other lands summoned back. Our Government turned off the Internet - a communication method if you will - and together, the land put all their effort into disappearing. We went dark. People searched for us - foes and friends - but we made no contact. We simply stayed underground, hidden from view, surviving as one. Many years later, people stopped looking for us. Yet, we still stayed hidden. A new generation was born, and, instead of passing on our history, the Government chose to hide it. They fabricated a new history, and let the true one die with time.

Folks around here traded nightmares like old wives' tales, maybe that's how they worked through their fear. I was a bit more analytical than that, though I'm certainly not immune to the atmosphere surrounding that forest. And I use forest in the loosest way. It is n't the place you'd go for a hike, and certainly not a place to thrive. Which is why it was troubling when my childhood friend gained an inexplicable fascination for that glorified bramble patch, he once told me he wanted to see the heart of it, the oldest of the old growth. Being a teenager at the time, I was n't prescient or witty enough to tell him to write a will beforehand, or to use string or breadcrumbs to find his path in the darkness. He vanished in August of that year, just before school resumed. His parents were despondent, and once it was known that I was likely the last person to see him alive, it fell on my shoulders to explain the unexplainable. I did n't get it then, now it only makes me bitter. There were no search parties, no grid search, nothing of the sort. The elders simply repeated the tired line, `` the old growth claims its own.'' Fliers stapled to lightposts deteriorated and vanished as quickly as Jason, and as early as that winter he was a rumor to all but his family and closest friends. Maybe it was a quirk of misfortune that I saw something move in the old growth yesterday. It contrasted with the deep earthen tones, and moved fluidly between the gnarled roots of the edge. I felt it stop to study me, which sent a chill up my spine as I turned away. I put it out of my mind last night at the local watering hole with copious amounts of liquid fire. It would have worked too, had I not seen it again. This time it made it's presence obvious, standing atop one of the thickest roots, facing away but seemingly aware of my focus. I could see it sway in the breeze, and for a moment I thought it was an animal, before it walked to the highest point of the root, giving away it's form against the graying sky. A chill ran up my spine when I thought of Jason, and this thing turned its head toward me as if he heard me whisper his name. It reached down with one arm, and swung down into the underbrush, in a display that will haunt me until the end of my days."}

My ears dimly process the sounds of nuclear warning sirens overlapping the agonizing cries of thousands, my state of mind in an entire universe millions of light years away. I am no longer in the middle of an air raid but instead a bright -- too bright -- white conference room. Everything is white and chrome, polished to a sheen that burned the retinas. The guttural shrieks of pain that tore at my ear drums were replaced with light chatter. The memory snaps into place with an audible click. It is now five years earlier. Sweat beads my brow as I realize all chatter subsided, every eye in the room on me. These familiar faces are smiling at me, anticipating my response but to what exactly, I do n't know. I have no idea how I'm here and not in the current time. `` Could you repeat the question?'' I ask sheepishly, still disoriented. `` That's quite all right, Mr. Burns,'' the presenter -- a tall, well dressed man wearing a lab coat over his finely pressed suit -- chuckled. It was Dr. V -- his real last name was too convoluted for me to bother with learning its pronunciation. `` I was just asking if anyone had any questions regarding Project S.a.?'' Ah, it's all coming back to me now. This fateful night, a deal was made. Our antibacterial lifestyle has taken its toll and the issue of running out of useable antibiotics has grown to become a global issue. We have tried and tried again to find something to use, but it was a fruitless mission that led to deaths in the millions. We were running out of time and hope -- that is, until Dr. V graced my doorstep. He enlightened me with his research on ancient strains of MRSA, showed me his notes on patterns he had noticed that surprisingly no one else had put together. As the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, I was so close to throwing myself off the edge as news reports of death tolls skyrocketing because microbes that were once harmless had super evolved to become absolutely lethal. Dr. V had become my savior. Fingernails digging into my shoulders drag me out of my reverie. I let out a yelp and nearly jump out of my skin when I see blank eyes and torn up flesh in front of me."}

I knew that I'd have to be... creative shall we say, to achieve a balance between personal morals and illegal activities. But the idea, to commit every crime without capture, that intrigued me. I wish I could say it had been my idea, and if I had n't already crossed off copyright theft from my list I'd take the credit, but no it came from my brothers girlfriend Kelly. It was one of those relaxed, slightly drunken, conversations you find yourself having at the end of a party. There were a few of us talking and laughing and eating the last of the birthday cake when someone started telling a story about how he'd once went home early only to find his now ex-roommate stealing his stuff to pay off his hooker. Only the guy was so high he did n't even notice he was trying to hand over his stolen loot to its original owner. When challenged on it he'd thrust a handful of badly photocopied bank notes at him and screamed `` I'm a bro, I can fix this'' and then puked over himself before collapsing unconscious. We were all laughing with disbelief and shock as he ended the story with how he had to then explain all of that to the police and ambulance crew while constantly reassuring them it was all true. And as we finished laughing and started getting ready to leave, Kelly idly wondered out loud who in history had ever broken the most laws. That was it. A lighthearted question no one could answer became my obsession. I started with research. Academic papers, history books, archives, libraries, I scoured each bit of information for clues. But I could never get an answer that seemed right. I found countless criminals throughout history but they were always known for committing a handful of crimes. A man who had killed eight people became infamous but the fact was he had only broken one law, that of murder, eight times. The man who had broken eight different laws without killing anyone had largely gone unrecorded, at least as far as I could find. I finally decided that to achieve peace of mind I would need to make my own answer, and it would have to be me. I would make it my life's mission to break every law at least once. Now I know what you're thinking. Why? I'm sorry to say I have no idea. Maybe a therapest could answer it. Perhaps I have a naturally twisted mind.

Even with the air conditioning going, I swear the heat and humidity made the air in the car so thick you could swim through it. My hands are taking turns falling asleep on the wheel from all the road vibration, courtesy of Shitty Unmaintained Interstate Road Inc. I'm pretty drowsy at this point too, actually. Staying up all night packing will do that to a guy. To be fair though, I'm looking forward to this trip probably-close-to-but-not-quite asmuch as Eliza is. ( Going to Disneyland is a big moment in a 7-year-old girl's life, I'd imagine. A milestone maybe? ) It's been a busy couple of months in the office lately\u2014all of them pretty intense\u2014what with those fucks screwing up the recent Bay Bridge retrofit and our firm being called in to inspect and fix everything. I've been out in the field half the time and on-call for guys who are out in the field the other half. I've been stuck in hours upon hours upon hours worth of meetings with high-powered local figureheads, gruff contractors, and hordes of perfectionist engineers. Anyway, as you can imagine, it's been tough. So really, spending a few really uncomfortable hours in the car is a piece of cake if it means getting away from the human pressure cooker for a weekend. I'm holding about 80 in the left lane of the two lane desert highway. Not exactly kosher, if you're the kind of guy who follows the letter of the law, but out here on this kind of road, everybody does it. I've got my eye on the dark green pickup to my right, dancing with the Bott's dots to his left and the rumble strip to his right a bit, but generally staying in his own lane."}

General Pratt nodded firmly, ceremoniously pushing open the double doors and leading the president inside. The tense hum of voices died down almost immediately as faces grew somber at her presence. There was another long silence before she spoke up. `` Well? Give me the skinny, people. What do I need to know?'' General Pratt turned to face her in the absence of a response. `` Madam President... what you're about to hear tonight is top secret. Classified data beyond all other classified data. If any of this were to get out...'' He shuffled his feet and glanced at his cohort. `` Well, suffice it to say that it ca n't get out.'' He turned away from her, nodding to a younger man sitting at the table. `` Jenkins, let's start with you.'' `` W-well, uh, first up I suppose we should talk about... a-about area 51, ma'am. You see, it's- uh, there are aliens there-'' a murmur ran through the room, and out of the president's earshot, more than one member of the meeting muttered disappointment with Jenkins' lackluster offering. Like a comic losing a crowd, he sputtered on without much enthusiasm until Pratt finally cut him off. `` Yes, yes- thank you, Jenkins, that was... informative. The bottom line is that yes, we've been conducting experiments on aliens at Area 51, but that's only the tip of the iceberg here, ma'am.'' In a lower voice, he confided `` You'll have to forgive the poor boy, it's his first time doing this, and he obviously is n't comfortable with the material.'' The president nodded, her expression surprisingly forgiving and understanding, perhaps due to the revelation of what Jenkins said rather than how he said it. A woman only barely Jenkins' senior stood next. Her uniform bore the surname'Latrell'. `` I think we can all agree that aliens obviously existed. No real surprise there. But you may not have guessed that aliens are n't the only non-human intelligent life forms we're aware of, Madam.'' A few furtive looks flew between the others at the table. `` I'm talking about a smaller scale of creature. You may know them better as pixies.'' The president's eyebrows rose in a mix of surprise and skepticism. `` They're not like they were in fairy tales, madam. From our research they appear to be some kind of offshoot branch of insect that somehow developed... well, near-human levels of intelligence."}

It felt good to have the hustle and bustle of an office surrounding me again, albeit a bit unnerving since I'd been out of steady work for months now. `` So, how have you settled into your new office, Jackson?'' I glance over at the slightly pudgy and kind face of a smiling Mr. Anthony Patient. `` As well as you can settle into a cubicle I suppose, but I would n't trade it for the world right now. Really, Anthony, thank you so much for offering me this job. I ca n't believe I'm finally going to be able to see Blaise graudate. She's been putting it off for months now, with her mother's hospital bills and all.'' `` College life is going to be easy for that girl after all she's been through. She deserves it. Just consider it a gift, bud. It's the least I can do.'' I nod my head and give him a small smile as we stop walking, having arrived at Anthony's office door. He briefly pauses to fill a white, disposable styrofoam cup with a steaming black liquid from the office coffee pot sitting just outside. As the familiar smell fills my nostrils, he adds, `` Do n't forget the meeting we have at ten! I need you to pick up the quotes for the client early to make sure they look right, so after you drop your stuff off I need you to head over there now.'' `` Absolutely! Just text me the address and I'll head out as soon as I can.'' Anthony reaches down to his left pant pocket and pulls out a dirty and cracked iPhone. His fingers briefly fly across it and I feel a buzz in my pocket. `` Got it!'' I say as I briefly pat the pocket where I keep my phone. `` See you at ten o'clock sharp,'' he replies, opening his office door. As the door shuts behind him, I look at the address on the phone. `` 21st Street, huh?'' I plug it into the directions app on my phone and see that it is about a forty five minute drive. Key word: drive. Ever since I could remember, I've hated cars because of the images that haunt my dreams every night. A violent sound almost breaking my ear drums, accompanied by my tangled and broken body draped over the steering wheel; my own blood splattered and filling the cracks in the windshield.

The polls showed Senator Stiles ( D-CA ) and Governor Wilson ( R-KY ) were neck and neck. The previous eight years of peace and economic growth could be contributed to the bipartisan effort to actually make the United States a country to be proud of. No longer were the two isles busy flinging shit at each other. In fact, it almost did n't matter who won the presidential election. Each candidate showed willingness to work with the other parties ( yes, more than two parties ) in Congress order to pass legislation. Fred Phelps would turn 95 years old in 8 days. He had delegated the everyday workings of the Westboro Baptist Church to his daughter, though he was still considered the symbolic figurehead. Phelps watched as his country, state by state, voted to make same-sex marriage legal. The only state which had held out was his home-state of Kansas. However, this year, there was a proposition on the ballot to make the United States homogeneous in regards to same-sex marriage. Phelps and the WBC had n't stopped picketing. Either in their hometown, or flying across the country for a soldiers funeral or the opening of a Center for LGBTQ teens. Standing on street corners with signs reading `` God Hates Fags'' and `` Thank God for Dead Soldiers'' was still the go-to protest tactic. As the 21st had worn on, Phelps had started receiving more and more criticism from everyone from Bill O'Reily to Chris Matthews. Criticism soon turned to outright hate. Phelps could n't count how many times he had received death threats. He constantly had to have his property cleaned of eggs and pumpkins and toilet paper. Anything and everything that ever went wrong in the United States became Phelps' fault. `` It's all for the greater good'' he thought to himself as he stepped into the ballot box. Phelps was wearing sunglasses ( ones that should be worn after laser-eye surgery ) and an old baseball cap to help avoid being recognized by the voters. He was n't staying around for long anyway. There was only one issue he needed to vote on. Phelps checked the `` yes'' box. He smiled to himself and then left the booth. Later that night, Phelps turned on the TV to watch the results of the election. It looked like Wilson would be the new president. His supporters cheered and Stiles gave a heartfelt concession speech. Finally, Rachel Maddow came on TV to announce the result of the same-sex marriage bill in Kansas. Phelps leaned forward in his seat, as far as his frail body would allow him to."}

And as my boots clicked softly against the flagstones, muffled by the age-old dust and grime, I felt a sense of... nostalgia, almost, but not quite. Like there was something here which I'd forgotten so long ago, something that a part of me had unconsciously come to reclaim. *Accept me. * The hairs on the back of my neck sprang up, and I planted my feet, looking around quickly and putting my back towards a wall. *Witness me. * The voice... did n't come from a direction. It seemed, rather, to reverberate through my own mind, to come from within me. *Hearken. * My eyes, wide-open and alert for an unknown threat, found themselves inexorably drawn to a barely-lit corner, to a pile of rags and moldy leather. The faintest hint of rusted iron landed in the center of my gaze and despite my better judgement I was spellbound. *Yes... * `` Who...?'' *I was given to many names in my lifetime... All of them stolen by others in this room, newer legends of greater import... I have been `` Redeemer'', `` Unforgiven'', `` Answerer'', `` Godslayer'', `` Sword of Promised Victory''...

Both men shifted in their seats. Jim flicked at his nose like he's seen so many coke heads do across dusty tables back at the station. He cleared his throat. They did that all the time, right? Mike sat as a dealer would sit. The confiscated police funds sat in a neat stack in Jim's sweaty pocket and Mike's baggie with a pinch of 2-3 years lay impatiently in the drawer next to him. Unbeknownst to one another, they shared a collective thought at the exact same moment: `` Fuck it, there's no recording of this deal. I'm going to arrest his ass and find the goods.''

Orbital combat drops had been the only tactical solution to the automated orbital defenses the Alien Darithians had perfected millennia before man began his first cautious forays into space. It was a desperate move by the Marines, desperate to force their enemy into an unconditional surrender after decades of bloody conflicts against autonomous drone formations they could not break. Launching a series of manned pods from extra solar rail gun stations into planets at ultra high velocities into inhabited planets turned out to be every bit as dangerous as it sounded but the subterranean infrastructure of the enemy made bombardment with munitions complex enough to do real damage unable to bypass the automated defenses. John shook anxiously within his cr\u00e8che, looking at the HUD readout fed into his peripheral vision through a computer implanted directly into his brain which wirelessly communicated with the onboard equipment of his pod. He was stacked inside a large magazine compartment with his new platoon. His first had been a total loss from the last drop. He had been alone on the ground for most of the ground combat on his last drop and had barely been recovered just in time to make this drop. Four drops in two months. He should have been evacuated from the front after the second but by some arcane sleight of hand on the part of the Byzantine Naval bureaucracy he found himself once again hooked to this damnable machine. Statistically he should be long dead. He did not feel lucky. He would give anything to have been intercepted on insertion on his first drop. Inertial suppressors mean that you do n't feel anything as your pod rotates from the magazine to the firing tube. Only the flashing red prompt keeps John apprised of his movement. No amount of physics magic could allow him to miss the acceleration to 4 % the speed of light in six kilometers towards the tiny rock that would be his next target. He steadies, the approach is the most dangerous though peaceful part for him. He has seen endless simulations and received numerous briefings on contingencies and probabilities. He connects to the exterior sensors of the pod and sees his platoon tumbling along with him at nearly identical vectors. This approach will be nearly 24 hours long. He checks diagnostics mechanically, not really caring that all functions are nominal. He is so tired. He wakes to a loud ping from his computer. They are a few minutes out. Anxiety sits like a hot coal on his diaphragm and he checks diagnostics. Nominal. He looks at the external sensors at the rapidly expanding blue orb gaining resolution before him."}

His was the only face I could remember so clearly, so perfectly to rival even a photograph, because I had seen it every waking hour of my life. Sometimes he would just stare, stood dead centre of my view, sometimes he would occupy himself in my peripheries. I witnessed him meditating, or perhaps praying, on numerous occasions. At first, I was scared beyond measure, children do not react well to strangers, but then I realised he was completely inert. An ever present monolith, never aging, never reacting, simply being. He would move to avoid my touch, turn away to evade speech, and simply disappear amongst crowds. The aquiline nose, strong jaw, sunken eyes - an odd shade of green - and defined cheeks gave the visage a look of nobility, a king perhaps. But his skin, a shade of brown darkened by years of work in the sun, suggested otherwise. He wore loose fitting, enamel white clothes, like a nomad of some vast desert. He had never smiled, until today. I could only imagine he grew careless, unaware I was watching. I dismissed the thought. Then, an hour later, he seemed to pick something up. A pen. He examined the lidded implement, smiled at it, then removed the cap and examined the nib. He drew a word in the air, perhaps his name. Another few hours and lunch rolled by. He sat opposite me, as usual, watching me eat a bland sandwich, congealed rice from the night before and a tepid cup of tea. His nostrils flared, sniffing the air around him. What was mundane to me was alien to him, an expression of awe at the interesting smells. It was another few hours before I returned home, he again swung the pen to the shape of a word. In the kitchen, the fridge presented a simple ready meal, a plastic dish of heart-clogging fat and empty calories was all I had the energy to make. What was ten years for a little convenience? As the microwave whirred into life, I took a cigarette and lit it. I offered the carton to the stranger, as usual, and he took one, for the first time. `` Thank you,'' he rasped. I would have jumped to my feet if I was n't so tired. Never had I put a voice to his mouth. He spoke clearly, he took his time with a mere two words after thirty years. `` I have to say,'' he continued, putting the cigarette aside, `` you are an interesting one."}

Not for the first time, he cursed putting his past on the enlistment form. Molsky was from the planet Kilarney, notable only for its complete lack of importance in Inner Sphere society. Isolated from the militant Marian Hegemony and the Free Worlds League's ancient enemy in the Lyran Commonwealth the world escaped the Word of Blake's Jihad and weathered the collapse of the League purely by being deemed too unimportant to bother with. Which suited the inhabitants just fine, as their principal export were fine woods and quality whiskey and nothing of military or industrial value. Molsky himself was from a family of timberjacks, and though they'd been in the business for over five centuries, Jerin was sick of it. Fearing he'd spend the rest of his days behind the controls of a lumber truck or else stuck in some office, he lept at the chance to get off the rock he spent his whole life on and go see the rest of the Inner Sphere. So naturally, he got made a glorified park ranger. Perhaps it was a tad unfair to call it that. Officially, he was the assistant scout of Fourth Platoon, K company, Wraith Battalion of Colonel `` Typhus'' Novak's Grave Guards. Officially, that position meant it was his task to patrol for enemies and act as a trailblazer for the rest of his platoon. Unofficially, it meant he was in ancient Terran space flight parlance, the `` Redshirt.'' Upon learning the origins of the term, he watched the thousand year series and laughed at its anachronism and idealism. A united humanity exploring the galaxy in the name of peace and science. He'd seen better plot lines in *Immortal Warrior. * No Tri-Vid technology, laughable costumes and unrealistic sets. Still, for sheer comedic value it was rather good, even if their English was rather stilted. But he was good at what he did, possessing a keen eye and a penchant for detail.

In terms of gear, it usually implies that you haven \u2019 t put the time in to have a quality set. I knew this would be my last time on this game and I haven \u2019 t had the time at Level 90 to build a quality set for Enhancement. The walking cow on my screen is ChainHealBot and from his name I \u2019 m sure you can grasp a small amount of the history that we went through together. It \u2019 s strange to think this is the end but, in this level 70 raid named Karazan, I know we enjoyed the best time we \u2019 ve ever had together. Roaming mobs of wizards and skeletons ignore me as I make a right up these hallowed steps. The implied decadent past reminds me of my own with this game and the strange coming of age ritual that I know few will understand. This story started with a 13 year old boy at Christmas. My parents, regrettably, bought me a game that was akin to a cocaine addiction. Sneaking out at nights to level, grind and even fish in this magical world provided an escape from an awkward social scene and crippling self imagine. Here I understood the rules and I knew that with time paid into my character, I would gain the respect of my peers. A shaman was never chastised because of his weight, never rejected by his peers or criticized for never reaching his potential. Freedom and societal acceptance were what Blizzard hosted on the Tichondrius server and thus my dependence was born. ChainHealBot now arrives at the grand stage of the Opera. Of all the boss fights in WoW this is still my favorite and to my delight, I get to replay the tale of Little Red Riding Hood. There was a time I used to lead the raids on this place, the golden years of my addiction. Large Grandma Wolf used to be a challenge for my heroic little band, but now, in less than 3 seconds, is a corpse at my feet. I figure that for this last time through, I don \u2019 t need whatever loot this wolf was carrying and I \u2019 m contempt to carry on my way with the Golden Fairies Shimmering at my feet. Strange to think that this 10 man replaced the old required 40... At 14 I tried hand at the 40 player raiding scene only to met with the harshest of rejections."}

She quickly spotted the old man and turned her attention towards him, clearing her throat to catch her attention. `` Mr. Gorham? Are you ready?'' she asked. He paused briefly, then nodded. He stood up, shuffled quietly towards the door and entered the hospital room. Inside, machines beeped lightly in the background. Mr. Gorham knew the sounds well -- from just a moment's attention, he knew that nothing had changed yet. He walked towards the back corner of the room where Doctor Feldman stood waiting. `` Whenever you are ready.'' the doctor said quietly. Mr. Gorham moved towards the side of the bed and sat on the small chair. He looked at the patient as she inhaled and exhaled rhythmically, her frail breath barely coloring the oxygen mask. He raised his hand and brushed her thin white hair away. He lightly touched her cheek with the back of his hand, his hand lingering for a few moments more. `` Go ahead, doctor.'' he whispered, his voice rough and heavy. Doctor Feldman motioned to the nurse and began adjustments to the nearby computer terminal. Moments later, the beeping changed tones. The patient's breathing became erratic and labored, and Mr. Gorham took her hand into his, gripping it tightly. `` 2 minutes, Mr. Gorham.'' the doctor said. The old man nodded and positioned himself close to the patient as he prepared himself to speak. As the patient opened her eyes, Mr. Gorham leaned as closely as he could towards her. He had only a moment to see her. Mrs. Gorham stared groggily at her husband as the opiates faded from her system. After a few seconds, her eyes sharpened focus. She smiled weakly as she recognized the man in front of her. `` Mickey,'' she whispered. `` You've lost weight.'' Mr. Gorham laughed bitterly -- she'd beaten him to the punchline yet again. As he laughed, Mrs. Gorham winced involuntarily. The pain had already begun kicking in. `` 90 seconds, Mr. Gorham.'' the doctor called out. Mr. Gorham nodded and tapped his foot. The accident had nearly destroyed her spine, such that she could only stay lucid for a few moments before suffering extreme pain. It was all he could do to stare at Cheryl's face and do his best not to cry. `` What date is it, Mickey?'' Cheryl asked, her voice wavering in pain. `` November 5..."}

Katya had never seen people *eat* so constantly - and with such abandon. In all the Tiers she had lived in, food was a luxury that only the stupendously wealthy wasted money on \u2013 mostly as a means to impress, to flaunt that wealth. But her attention turned away from the waxy, cardboard cartons as Jane \u2019 s voice cut through her thoughts. \u201c Originally, \u201d the blond woman began, \u201c there were no Tiers; there were just districts in one huge City. Sennaya was one such district, as were all the others \u2013 Nightside, Urbia, Harbourview etcetera. \u201d She punctuated the names by gesturing in the direction the places had once been, in relation to Sennaya.

Sensory upgrades still had to be purchased, but the upload packages people bought to enter Ziggurat often included them \u2013 as well as storage packages and other upgrades. \u201d She tossed one of the old magazines onto the table. The cover read \u2018 Wired \u2019 and the headline below \u2013 emblazoned over a wireframe picture of a digital avatar \u2013 read \u2018 The New Frontier: Digital Utopia or Virtual Hell? \u2019 \u201c As the place got more crowded, more popular, the System was forced to redistribute resources. It split the world into three levels; poor, average and wealthy. \u201d Jack picked up the thread of conversation now, eager to add his knowledge, \u201c Render distances and other \u2018 privileges \u2019 were reduced for the poor \u2013 as well as the ability to enter the other Tiers. For the average citizen, in the second Tier, the changes were barely noticeable; while the wealthy maintained full access and saw themselves as having privileges over the lesser Tiers. \u201d \u201c Thus Ziggurat was born, \u201d Jo intoned. Katya listened, spellbound, as Jane picked up the thread again, \u201c Over time, the conditions in the Old World deteriorated \u2013 famine, sickness, overcrowding were the norm. \u201d She rapped the magazine with her knuckles, \u201c And so the supposed \u2018 Virtual Hell \u2019 began to look increasingly appealing to everyone left behind. *Legions* of people began to pour in, threatening to upset the balance that had been found. \u201d She trailed off, picking at the label of her beer."}

I knew where it was; about ten minutes by foot, less by car. I grabbed my rental's keys and headed out the door. It was a nice day outside, perfect for a drive into the city to window shop, but I had a job to do. I got on the plane with no problems, even got my tools past security. I got onto the plane just as easily, citing a family emergency. Sure, I was in coach and the target was in 1st, but a job was n't worth taking if it did n't present at least a little bit of a challenge. That was the least of my problems. When we were in the air, I excused myself to use the restroom and changed into a flight attendant's uniform I'd obtained two days before. My first hurdle appeared in the form of a stewardess. Tall, blonde, eyes that betrayed the exhaustion behind her smile that faded the second she saw me. `` What are you doing in the restroom?'' she asks. `` Sorry, nature called very strongly. I'm still getting used to flying.'' Not entirely a lie. `` That's fine. Now, listen, I want you to handle 1st-class. I'd do it, but I'm afraid I'd wind up throttling the kid who keeps tripping me whenever I pass.'' He'll be the one with the Transformers t-shirt and bright-red sneakers.'' `` Thanks for the warning. Look, go take a break, you look dead on your feet. Grab a coffee or a sandwich or something.'' Again, not entirely a lie. The poor kid's bound to start losing hair next. `` Sure, I think I will.'' She leaves me with a quick smile, a genuine one, judging by the way it reached her eyes. I look at the list of names in my hand. None of them matter, except one. Mischa Elgin, row 4-b. Steak, medium-well, side of white rice and veggies, red wine. Pretty average meal choice. It'd be pretty easy to disguise the poison I'd intended to use. So I went down to the kitchen and got to work. I grabbed the tray with the appropriate name and row on it, then headed back up to 1st-class. That's when I met hurdles 2 and 3.

This question was plastered on the back of Jane's mind as she arrived at her first college class that day, like the street tag on the local Applebees that refused to fade. What did *bubblesnot* mean anyway? Jane was n't particularly excited for her English 101 class that day anyway, and this disinterest just allowed her creeping thoughts more room to establish a semi-permanent residence in her psyche. She never had especially high aspirations for her post-high school career, but he parents were willing to front the bill, so what the hell? Jane's mind seemed to be occupied with blood type a lot these days, ever since she met that boy on check-in day, you know *that boy*. Ever since she was a little girl, Jane had been raised a good Christian. She knew the rules. Rule one: no sex before marriage. Rule two: only marry a man with the same blood type. These rules seemed simple enough growing up, but now she did n't know what to think. When she saw him sitting in his Toyota Tacoma outside her dorm, with his head swaying to the beat of *Killing in the Name* by Rage Against the MAchine that bumped inside the cab, Jane knew the world as she knew it had ended. She gathered hereself as best she could and made her way to her first class. Jane endured her English 101 class without incident. She did not pay much attention, but something her teacher said about Oedipus really spoke to her. On the way out the door, she ran into *him* again. `` Hey.'' He said, letting his gaze fall over her for a brief moment. To Jane it seemed like an eternity. `` Oh, hi.'' Jane managed to muster, but he was already gone. It did n't matter. The connection must have been obvious to anyone around. Jane continued home with an extra spring in her step. She even allowed herself a moment to stop and admire the *bubblesnot* tag on the way home. She came to the conclusion that none of it mattered, not the blood type, not her idiot parent's forcefed ideologies. She had figured it out. *He* was the one. When she ran the picture that she had taken on her phone when he was in his truck through the universal database, she found out that he was O+, and she did n't even care. He was worth it.

What could be so bad about the stinky, dirty- `` 11... 10... 9... 8...'' Mind made up, I ran as quick as I dared up the stairs, knowing the thumping of my feet would be a good enough indication that I was on the second floor. My heart stuttered, seeing the door that led to the attic, but Ryan's voice still echoed from downstairs and it was all I needed to push myself forward to open the door- The door did n't squeak. Weird, all doors in grandma's house squeaked. But it meant that I could close it silently, which I did, the small'click' of the door closing the only noise it made. I turned, the stairs to the attic, too, did n't seem to fit the rest of the house. They looked... newer, not like the stairs that led to the kitchen that had the last trick step Emma kept tripping on. But new stairs meant stairs that did n't squeak and with a stealth I did n't know I had, I climbed, leaving behind the door and Ryan's counting. There were fifteen steps in total. I know. I counted. At the top, though, I found to my surprise, a table. A new looking table. With an old typewriter on it which did n't seem to rightly fit in this new looking room. `` Huh.'' I said. This was odd, considering there was nothing else in the attic, just a new looking table and an old looking type writer. I moved forward. There was one sheet of paper already in the typewriter. Maybe grandma was about to write something? But the paper was blank. Mommy said not to touch things that were n't yours, but since this was grandma's, and since she's family, technically- I typed my name, `` R-i-l-e-y.'' The click-clack of the old typewriter in the new room echoed off the walls. `` My... name... is... R-i-l-e-y.'' I typed slowly. I did n't want to mess up, the words looked pretty on the paper and typing a word wrong would look weird. `` I like kittens and strawberry ice-cream.'' I almost stumbled over the word'strawbe-r-r-y'.

The purpose of our existence is to preserve equilibrium in this world from the anarchy and disarray attached to passing life into a comatose realm. Being the spirit of magic, I was the second essence to come into the reality of this realm. I was one of ten spirits who assisted in choosing the overseers, or guardians if you will, of the corporal part of this world. We knew they had to be influential, especially if God was attempting to abide humans in the realm of existence once again. Humans had never been an effective breed, but their potential was worth exploiting. As the first ten spirits, we came to the understanding that the guardians of this realm would need wisdom, strength, compassion, and most of all immunity to greed in order to trim the wild vines of humanity. It was decided that there would be two guardians. The yin and yang of this world, to balance each other in ways that would only befall the sanctity of peace. For the first time in my recycled existence, I chose to help name them. We watched them grow from single cell organisms into the dragons we had destined them to become. Their lives were challenging and treacherous at first, but we remained with them through every moment to silently mentor them into the guardians they needed to become. It was a proud moment as I witnessed their first uses of the magic I bestowed to them. Over the eons many of the spirits were pulled away to begin the other aspects of variations of life, but I stayed.' From the times where volcanic ash swam in the air as thickly as the water particles in the ocean to the moments when the first tree caressed its roots between the soils of the earth, I was with them. The other spirits would come visit them of course, but I never abandoned them. It was vital for their development that I nurture them with my presence. Time is irrelevant when you are born in the shadow of a world, my young guardians discovered this over time. Our paths intertwined in ways they would not be able to fathom until they were older. Like me, they would only die when the world around them crumbled into a non-existent state. New life was born around them, and I viewed silently with pride and amusement as they inquisitively adventured through the physical realm."}

The issues I had in life were not suddenly taken back and solved and my true purpose was laid out in front of me like perfect brick road. No, it was pure clarity of all of reality. There was so much to take in, as if every facet of details about every single possible object or event in the history of existence was suddenly mine to play with. If I wanted to know how Kurt Cobain really died, I would be there instantly in the room where he did actually shoot himself. If I wanted to know how particles get their characteristics I could see the strings that control it. But it was so much deeper than that, I could understand fully how each curve in each unique dimension caused that string to have it's particular effect. Each tiny movement growing into the more dymanic creation that is the universe. It's possible this was all a hallucination, but it just so incredibly vivid. The moment was of pure clarity felt like a life time. All the worries I had ever had were gone, not even close to being remembered. At that point I was no longer myself, I was everything and everything was me. As I moved time moved, as I cried it rained, and life itself existed within and beyond me but I could focus in on each individual. I could focus on the heartbeat of unique creatures from planets unimaginable. From the moment I stepped off of that skyscraper, everything in the universe had suddenly made sense. I was more comfortable with the knowledge of the universe in those final moments than I had been with the minute details of my entire life up until this point. I was taken back through time to see creatures that dwelled on earth before me, and creatures that still dwell else where in the universe. I was able to see dark matter, and hold a strange particle. I was able to influence politicians into passing laws for me, or convincing a man to hunt down someone who did n't believe in me. I saw both the good and the bad, I felt the balance on good and evil within me. Unfortunately, this feeling was short lived as I quickly crashed back into reality long enough to realize that I had just killed myself. Just enough consciousness to regret jumping in the first. Yet, with no regret and sudden clarity, I drifted to death peacefully. For that one small moment in time, I was God."}

They sped through the exhibit of early 20th century American art and entered The Hall of Post Great War Europe. As the tour guide began her spiel, two of the class clowns began silently mocking her. Probably equally as bored, yet annoyed all the same by his students' improper behavior, Mr. Peters shot the two boys a stare that would make any high school kid think twice. Without missing a beat, the tour guide continued over the slight interruption. `` And here you can see one of our finer pieces on loan from Moscow, an original Adolph Hitler, painted in Munich 1944. It's called _Lunchtime in the City_. Clearly Hitler focuses on the industrious workers going to and from work, and the setting and backdrop illustrate a thriving Germany. This was painted only a few years after Germany was incorporated into the Soviet Union, which of course brought it out of terrible poverty that the reparations from the Great War caused...'' The class had seen this before, of course. The painting was synonymous with the Communist movement in the 40s and 50s, a period incredibly boring to Mr. Peters' class and teens across the globe for its largely uneventful three decades. Everyone loved learning about the Great War in the beginning of the 20th century, and everyone was fascinated by the Wars of Containment between the US and USSR in the 70s, but the 1930s to 50s were decades of immense nothingness in the view of the average American 16 year old. The Smithsonian tour guide continued her hagiography of Hitler and endless praise of his magnum opus, when Ruth raised her hand. Mr. Peters groaned inwardly -- though his brightest student by far, Ruth was always the thorn in any authority's side. `` Ma'am, I know this painting is universally beloved and praised for its promotion of peace and the greater good and all that'' Ruth said. `` But I ca n't help but notice the subversive elements in the background. The factory workers back there hazing the Orthodox Jew. The banker in the dingy house over there counting money is clearly portrayed as a Jewish stereotype.'' The tour guide briefly looked to the painting and laughed, `` Oh yes, good eye dear. Scholars have noticed those images as well, but it's universally considered a practical joke. Everyone knows Jews did n't live in Germany or the USSR in that era. There's hardly any record of any Jews living in the Soviet Union at all, even today none live there."}

I am proud to be able to say that I have led this land for the last eight years, and I am sure every single President who has previously had the honor of holding the post would say the same. However, my term is now coming to a close, and I must soon leave office. After countless weeks of discussions with my staff, I have decided that this final Presidential Address would be the best time for me to make the announcement that has been planned since my second term started. From the end of my term onward, there will be no more presidents. I know what you're all thinking. Why? Well, that's where the big personal announcement comes in. My countrymen, I must admit that I have not been entirely honest with you from the beginning, the greater part of a decade ago. So here it is out in the open for the first time. I'm a woman. And not just a woman. A transgender woman. And not just a transgender woman. A pansexual transgender woman. And on top of that, I have Hispanic and Asian ancestry. To top it all off, I am an immigrant from a poor background. That's right. An immigrant. Now you might be asking yourself how this relates to the ending of the Presidency? Well, the answer is simple. With all my previous personal features publicly known, there is no need to have any other presidents to address any issues related to equality of the position. We wo n't need a Hillary Clinton to be the first female president. We do n't need a Juan Alvarez to be the first Hispanic president. We do n't even need Happy McGay to be the first openly gay or bi or whatever president. I'm all of the above. So America, I leave you with this. Enjoy your day and the rest of your time knowing there's one less social issue to worry about."}

One of them stepped closer but the boy quickly stepped back, hand still firmly clutching the blade of the knife. \u201c I don \u2019 t need help. \u201d He told them firmly, refusing to be seen as weak. No longer would he be the weak, soft, spineless coward. Times were changing and Jason was certain that he was going to change with them.

Jason pulled out the slip of paper and began to unfold it, his blue eyes looking for the keywords, knowing that if he saw them, his anxiety would be forgiven. Everything would be forgiven. The paper he retrieved held no solace for the boy and he threw it aside, anger boiling. Jason yelled and tears began to form in the corners of his crinkled eyes. His fists formed and his face turned the color of a ripened tomato. \u201c It \u2019 s not fair! It \u2019 s not right! \u201d He screamed.

My story is one of pain and loss. When I was 11, my father got fired from his job as an accountant at a photocopying firm. My life has never been the same since. My father got another job in a month or so, but it did n't matter, because I already vowed to myself to take revenge on corporations - by tearing them apart from the inside. School was difficult. No one understood the extent of my loss, and those with divorced parents or parents lost to accidents laughed at me. What they did n't know was that it only made me stronger. I never had any real friends there, but it did n't matter. I was on this quest alone the entire time. I received a bachelor's degree in accountancy after school. My time at the university helped me understand the inner workings of companies and how best to take them down. Three failed group assignments taught me another valuable lesson - not to trust anyone except yourself, your skills and your tools. After four interviews I've landed a job at a computer retailer, and that is where I am now. I am slowly dismantling the corporations, and so far no one suspects anything - hiding my true intentions was important at all stages of my life. I tell you this in hopes that you understand my pain and struggle and all the trials that I've gone through. I act behind the scenes, at the desks of companies that no one ever looks at.

As I read in one of the psychology books in the library across the hall from the women clothes store: `` Humans are naturally sociable animals. Extended periods with no communication to others whatsoever can even lead to brain damage, in extreme cases.'' Most days were filled with me messing about, doing all the things that were illegal or on my bucket list. That was only until I realized how lonely I was. That's when I settled in a shopping mall. The mannequins are a great source of fake human contact. It must've been twenty days since I had started living in the deli on the first floor. At the moment, I had setup a community. They all had names, families, relationships and quirks. Stacy loved to sunbathe under sun that peered through the glass roof around midday. Henry just loved barbecues so much he lived in the hardware store, a mattress squished between a few grills; a manliness fortress as he calls it -- silly old man. Those two are just a sample of the fifty plus community I had installed around the mall. One day, I believed a little harder that I was going insane. Just a little more than usual. I was walking down the power tools aisle in the hardware store. That sector was Trevor's. As I passed the said `` man'', I could swear I heard a faint complaint rise from his plastic mouth. `` Help me...'' Naturally, I turned around quickly towards him, elegantly stretching my arms in a grotesque pose. `` I beg your pardon, *Monsieur Trevor*'', I exclaimed, making an utter fool of myself to the absence of eyes watching me. Obviously, he did n't reply. He was a mannequin. A few days later, I heard it again, from Stacy this time. She laid in her pool chair under the glass, looking as fabulous as ever. I was leaning over the railing of the second floor, gazing at the mall, wondering what I could do with the new buzz saw I had acquired in *Monsieur Trevor*'s aisle. It sounded more like a whisper at first. A barely audible exhalation struggling to overcome the ambient noise. I turned around towards her, only to find her **looking at me. ** Now, I know a mannequin could n't have a mind of it's own, but this was certainly unsettling. I gazed around to the other residents of *Kick-Ass Town*, making sure they had n't moved too. Of course, none of them had. What a silly idea. I started seeing things. Something like those empty plastic eyes following me."}

Mrs. Work was teaching her magicball team some tricks before the start of the game, the magical alternate of paintball. One of the basic things all magicians knew was that anytime you caused a spell, two things had to happen: you had to move your hand in the appropriate gesture, and if you were doing it correctly, your hand would flash momentarily. It was this flash she was warning the girls about. Esmarelda again smiled internally. -- -- `` How is that possible? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ALL? ``, shouted Mrs. Work. `` HIDE YOURSELVES, SECURE POSITION BEFORE ATTACK, CHECK YOUR SURROUNDINGS.'' She could n't believe it.

She had to do something. `` Esmarelda, grab your gear, you're going on. Emily, EMILY, come on out. You're done''. Esmarelda grinned, got up and prepped. She stepped on the field, barely slapped Emily's hand, and was out to her chosen spot in a flash. One or two open attacks for starters, and then her work begin. First, the opponent's team's captain lost her glasses. All the time they were slipping off, but now when the fell, the fell onto a particularly pointy stone and cracked. She was replaced. Then, two of their main attackers lost their bearings and almost simultaneously hit one another. Both out.

The arms and legs adjusted themselves slightly as they probed the air and ground, feeding back data onto the screen for him to peruse. He shut it off. Best to leave work for working hours. Realizing the sun was quickly approaching the horizon, he donned his hazard suit helmet and popped open the cabin with a satisfying *click*, exposing himself to the surface of Mars. He stretched his legs and slithered out of the cramped compartment, enjoying the freedom of being out in the open. The wasted surface of Mars greeted him without acknowledgement. He felt like a god. He was a god. Mere weeks ago, the reservoir that lay before him was an empty basin, no better than a mirage would be to a dehydrated man in a desert. He and his crew had tamed it, worked it with their relentless will and powerful machines, so it would reflect their desire, their pleasure. Now, a lake with Earth fish pleasantly filled his vision. He liked the red tint the planet gave it, a unique character. The sun continued to dip toward the horizon as he sat down on one of the giant rocks next to his machine. He contemplated removing his helmet, feeling the Martian wind sweep over his scalp. Then he remembered that the air was still too toxic for prolonged human exposure. He gambled. The helmet let out a depressing *hiss* as he removed it, sucking in a breath of cool Martian air. He began to feel light-headed, a result of his lack of adjustment to the thinner atmosphere. He closed his eyes, felt the wind pass over his face, then *clicked* the helmet back into place. The oxygen felt stale compared to the cool air. That's what he would work on next, he decided. Huffing as he stood up and walked back toward his bot, he resolved to find the musty transfer form he'd left in his dormitory and fill it out. He wanted to be on the first crew to terraform the air on this planet. He wanted to be the first one to feel it on his face. The sun dipped beneath the horizon, and he slithered back into the cramped cabin of his bot. He tapped the dash, the lights flashing as the machine rumbled back into ignition and began moving."}

He turned to take one last look before the wrinkled old gatekeeper slowly hobbled to close the doors. Taking in a deep breath, and gathering his courage, he took the first step in his journey to attaining a Guardian Spirit. It was a long standing tradition in his village. No one knew when, or how it started, or even where these spirits came from, but it was passed on to each generation from parent to child. The children of the village on their 18th birthday were sent through the gates, and into the Garden to look for the old shrine. There they would pray to the Gods, and if successful, they would be awarded a Guardian Spirit which would protect its host, and bestow upon them great blessings. And so, as tradition dictated, Mus started his journey. They say the garden takes a different form each person. Even if two people were to enter the garden at the same time, they would be instantly separated before they could notice, and each would see a different world around them. Each person's journey, and challenges would be different. Unfortunately for Mus, it seemed that the Gods did not particularly favor him, and his `` Garden'' turned out to be a steep forboding mountain. Dragging his feet up the path while cutting away at the thick foliage, he slowly made his way towards the top. After what seemed like hours of huffing and puffing, he decided to take a break. He sat down on a nearby rock to grab a quick bite to eat. While looking through his pack he noticed a letter that was stuffed in between some of this things. He grabbed it along with one of the sandwiches his mother made him. He took a bite as he unfurled the letter to read. It was from his childhood friend. The only one which Mus could consider to be his best friend. Accipiter was her name. She was, frankly speaking the complete and total opposite of Mus. Accipiter was loud, boisterous and physically strong, while Mus had always been quiet and meek person. It was quite surprising, especially to Mus himself that the two of them would end up as best friends. It was what many could consider a boy's name, and of course, many would also consider it a strange name for a girl. She was quite proud of it how ever as it was the name her father had given to her."}

Just a year after being granted provisional status in the Confederacy, a massive war broke out among humanity. They turned out to have far more weaponry than they had told the Confederacy. After the war, their population had been reduced by over two thirds. In the aftermath of that debacle, the Confederacy had renewed its efforts to rid itself of violence.

Why would the Confederacy need weapons?'' thought Pardok. As he set off to Earth government, Pardok wondered how the humans would receive the message.

It had felt like much longer than that. He reviewed what had happened in the last few days. The Xerach had invaded Confederacy territory in a blatant and unprovoked war of aggression. The Confederacy had been defenseless. President Darius had dispatched him with the fastest ships the Confederacy had. The fleet carried thousands of high tech goodies to entice the Humans to fork over weapons technology and perhaps some military minds. Tang asked the crewman again for the time until arrival.

He wakes up when he hears me slide my chair out from under my desk. `` You look like crap,'' I say. `` Do n't even talk to me,'' he says. `` You people disgust me.'' `` Whoa, what did I ever do to you?''

Cold still clings to the air, but by Sunday morning the sun is shining, the grass brown but alive beneath patches of snow.

Everything was soaked. We ended up calling it quits after that.'' I laugh. `` I was terrible at camping.'' Her laugh joins mine, softer but still so warm. `` You are terrible at a lot of things, but I still love you'' she says.

You know, I had my whole family there. I was old, living out my final days in the comfort of my childhood home. My kids were there, and so were their kids, and even a few of my great-grandchildren. I had lived a good life. `` He's reliving his last moments,'' a second voice said. It was feminine, unlike the first. `` That's normal. Open the pod.'' There was a light hissing sound as, what I realized was clear glass, opened in front of me. The room around was artificial, I knew that, but it was almost too artificial. Like it was made up in some lab a thousand miles away, never to be touched by mankind. I finally saw who the two voices belonged to. The second was a female, as I assumed. She stood tall, posture was perfect, and her hair looked just like my daughters. Wanda. That was her name, I *knew* it. The first voice was a man who looked old but had to be thirty years my younger. Or, was he my younger? I looked at my hands, my eyes drifting between the man's long grey beard and my own hands. They were n't wrinkly anymore. No, they were soft and *calloused*. I nodded. `` How was Heaven?'' I almost laughed at God's comment, that was n't his *actual* name, that's just what everyone called him around here. He was the Creator and the Savior, and just about everything in between. `` Better,'' I finally managed to croak out, my voice was coarse. From the pod, the fluids they fed me, I remembered that too. `` I made it to ninety-seven.'' I coughed a bit, thick pockets of dried phlegm coming out of the back of my throat. `` We watched your progress. A perfect run.'' I agreed. `` I can do better. Next time I go in.'' Wanda sighed at the comment and then I remembered. My eyes shut and my hands found their way to my face. I rubbed at it, trying to get the feeling back, trying to make my brain work again. `` What'd you learn?'' `` We threw everything we could at Heaven this time, tried to find what failed here."}

Few people apply this idea to the present moment; that we are all always at the start of rippling future-chains of events, and the right small changes can be incredibly valuable. Adam saw the future coming, he saw his opportunity and in seizing it, became a God. He watches us, from above and all around. He provides food and shelter, heals the sick, fills the night sky with stars and colours. And in doing so, He took our freedom, He neutered us. In the preAdamaic era, humankind built technologies as we conceived of them; mechanical advantage brought the earliest levers hoist and cogs, mechanical organization brought clockwork and intricacy, fossil fuel brought brute force, electricity brought power with finesse, radio brought distance, human organization brought factories and supply chains, computers brought interactivity and sensory awareness and Artificial Intelligence. Did you spot the lie? Artificial Intelligence was always on the horizon, but surprise surprise it was n't as easy to conceptualize'water' as it was to pump water, to design a gear system was harder than cutting one out with a LASER. And do n't let me start on the arguments, the armchair philosophising, the endless bullshit end of the world storytelling. All you need to know here is that the streams of ideas merged with Adam's success, and birthed a mighty and humbling river. The cyberpunks wanted head mounted displays, wearable computing, leading to neural connections and direct brain manipulation. The AI amateurs wanted to build a learning computer, and hope it learned to be nice instead of brutally, genocidally indifferent to human concerns. The AI professionals wanted to conceptualise friendliness as a mathematical construct and then build a machine from that. The SciFi authors wanted to scan a human brain into a computer and run it as a simulation. Adam had other plans. He saw the wearable computers as no more than a tool, forever separate and cognitively distant. The neural implants were too new and simplistic to be useful. The radical mathematicalization of human nature was progressing too slowly, and the brain scan of a person would result in... a person. None of these were the kind of transcendence He dreamed of. The first AI would have the first mover advantage. Lots of people thought so, but it was n't discussed enough to see how severe it would be this time. Historically, the first people to develop a new resource, a new invention, conquer a new land, they became rich and powerful."}
