If one more of these mortal women tried to hit him with undergarments he would... do something drastic. `` As you say, brother'' he murmured back. His entire adult life he had longed for the easy respect and admiration his golden brother got and now that he had it, he found he did n't care much for it. It was just as lonely as being despised, just with a different prefix. Their `` father'' was in the Odinsleep, Loki regent of Asgard. He had n't been entirely sure what would happen next, but whatever his half formed plans were, one look at the chaos Thor and his hammer were causing on Midgard and they were all but forgotten. One of these agents had *groped* Thor and after all the *unpleasantness* that was Amora his brother had almost suffered a panic attack. Loki had seen red, teleported down... and been swarmed by fans, male and female, who were rather... creepy. And that came from him. The father of Hela. At least the mortals were suffering too. The one called Coulson appeared stoic but his phone calls were getting increasingly louder. The one called Stark ( a rather interesting armor, Midgard seemed to have *some* brains ) was an atheist and was now going through a liquor store, trying to forget the theists had been proven right. The one called Rogers on the other hand was on his knees praying, his vibranium axe laid out before him. Loki was eying him warily, watching for any sudden undergarment appearances. The Son of Coul snapped something into his communication device and walked over to them. `` Okay listen up. This situation has officially strayed into Very Bad Thing territory. The Helenists are flipping their shit, the Romans are n't far behind and Tony is proposing a lamppost. Your... majesties. How do you feel about faking an alien attack to distract people?

If one more of these mortal women attempted to fling undergarments at him, he was ready to take drastic action. \"As you say, brother,\" he replied. Throughout his adult life, he had yearned for the effortless respect and admiration his golden brother received. Now that he had finally attained it, he realized it was as isolating as being despised\u2014just with a different label. Their \"father\" was deep in the Odinsleep, leaving Loki as the regent of Asgard. Unsure of the future, his vague plans were overtaken by the chaos Thor and his hammer were inciting on Midgard. One agent had *groped* Thor, and after the unpleasantness with Amora, his brother was on the brink of a panic attack. Seeing this, Loki felt his anger surge, teleported down, and was immediately surrounded by fans, both male and female, who were eerily enthusiastic\u2014even by his standards. He, the father of Hela, found it unsettling. At least the mortals were experiencing their share of discomfort. Coulson appeared stoic but his phone calls were getting increasingly frenzied. Stark, despite wearing intriguing armor\u2014suggesting Midgard did have some intellect\u2014was an atheist struggling with the realization that the theists had been vindicated, turning to liquor in desperation. Meanwhile, Rogers was on his knees praying, his vibranium axe laid before him. Loki watched him cautiously, anticipating any unexpected appearances of undergarments. Coulson snapped something into his communication device and approached them. \"Alright, listen up. We\u2019ve officially entered Very Bad Thing territory.

It seemed as though Stalin would advance too quickly, but we knew he was too dumb, and the will of the Soviets was weak like a dog. Dogs. So many old dogs back then, could you imagine? I think that's what life would be like had the Allies won: there would be dogs sniffing each other all over the streets, licking each other, acting like animals.

Usually, prophecies could be deciphered with some rudimentary investigation on LifeBucket, or any of the other countless social media suppositories. Repositories, I mean.

He had bellowed, not at all cryptically, that \u201c the cows would come home to roost! \u201d and then promptly keeled over and died. Mixed metaphors aside, his daughters, all on the north side of 600 pounds and strapped with grav-resist harnesses to help them get around, indeed came home to roost. They had all decided to move into his old home; in fact, they had been waiting for the old man to kick the bucket for awhile now, so that they could devour his assets like so many moon pies.

I'm not usually a swooning kind of girl, but as it turned out I was a sucker for romantic gestures. We'd been walking home from school together lately, and though he'd acted a bit cool at times, I could n't help but think he was interested in me. Yeah, I had a crush.

We were still walking home from school together, but I had n't noticed any changes in him... if anything, he seemed to have grown more distant. Then one night I found a note taped to the outside of my bedroom window. I yanked the window open and grabbed the envelope. In this note, Jake pledged his heart to me, claiming eternal devotion. He signed it the same way, `` you're greatest admirer,'' and promised to take the next step on Friday! I was giddy all week. Jake was going to ask me out on Friday!

She'd said silkily, dark hair blowing in the whipping wind. `` You can control me, if you want.'' I did want. `` You're a fucking bitch.'' I said now.

Saint Ivy's death was under my watch, so when Pyre stripped me of my protection and charred my armor\u2014as you can see\u2014it wasn't out of vengeance. It was my failure, but not an intentional evil. So, I was formally excommunicated from the faith I've served my whole life, with the 'technical' saint's blood on my hands. In response, I thought embracing 'evil' might serve as both penance and a kind of twisted revenge on those who 'wronged' me. These little acts are my way of satisfying a need while I figure out my future path. I'm leaning towards redemption\u2014perhaps joining a security company like Griffin And Steel, which seeks experienced fighters\u2014or simply relieving stress without harming the community.\" Silence followed Richard's unexpected confession. He tilted his head back, squinting at the sun through the slit of his helmet. \"Depravity makes one thirsty. Anyone up for a mead at the tavern?\" \"A mead? It's hardly past noon.\" \"I know!

Saint Ivy was killed, and I failed to prevent it, so Pyre, in retaliation, stripped me of his power and burned my armour-suit as you can see. So it was an evil act only 'technically,' as in, I failed. It wasn't out of 'malice.' And so I was cast out of the religion that I followed since birth and have now technically killed a saint. So I thought, in retaliation, to do evil in my own way. It's both payment in a sense, and revenge, on the people who 'wronged' me.

More than likely to undo my evil, perhaps join a mercenary guild \u2014 Griffin And Steel are looking for seasoned warriors to assist them \u2014 or something.

There was a time where you could freely oppose the government and their policies. A time where you were n't locked up for the most nonsensical charges. A time where you could actually move to another country. And it was also a time where you were n't monitored every single moment in your life. When you had the morbid curiosity about what a bomb would look like, you could simply look it up. Nobody seemed to care. Back when privacy still existed in the USA, there was still a lot wrong with our country. Institutional racism, the power of the corporations and climate change deniers where among the biggest problems of the US. But among all of those problems, there was one we just did n't pay enough attention to. The NSA. We were warned. Edward Snowden leaked the most important data about this in 2013. But we did n't care. Not enough. Although it was illegal what they did, the NSA did n't stop. They continued to gather information, and they continued to store it. It was a disaster waiting to happen. In 2020, President Thompson grabbed power. As a presidential candidate, he came of as a kind man. A man of the people. He seemed to understand what the people wanted, what they needed. But as a president, he became cruel and power-hungry. By now the NSA had been able to grow into the single most effective blackmail-machine in the world. And when they could n't find dirt on you, they'd simply create it. It did n't take long before he had most agencies in his pocket. And after that, most major companies as well. Google, Facebook. Sites used by nearly everyone. Information on nearly everyone. With that kind of power, it was rather easy to eliminate his political opponents. If you did n't agree with him -- hell, if you looked at him funny, he threw you into jail or simply had you killed. It took only one uprising to kill the spirit of the people. 20.000 men were killed in the New York massacre. After that happened, I knew I needed to get out of here. I barely made it across the Mexican border, because, you see, the wall is well guarded with fanatics of the Thompson-regime. Now every single aspect in the lives of Americans was controlled by the government. Today you do n't even think about speaking up against the government.

If they couldn't find dirt on you, they'd manufacture it.

Meet Holdgard McFreedy, a level 60 Gnoll: It's a tough gig working in retail, much less catering to every lousy adventurer, evil-sorcerer, and smelly dwarf, but somebody gots to do it. And that somebody is me. Holgard McFreedy, owner and proprietor of the Little Shop At the End of the Realm, purveyor of anything and everything you need to kill a dragon, weave a spell, or embark on never-ending radiant quests. You want it, I gots it. But I did n't choose this life, I twere n't no adventurer who took an arrow to the knee and I did n't save any unfortunate princesses from ogres. I was a scabber, an orphan, and a dungeon-rat. I worked my way up from the gutter, selling two-bit potions in caves, crafting my own boar-skin boxers, surviving on troll dung and mushrooms. I started at the bottom and slowly but surely I worked my way up to where I am now. But the story do n't end there. Like I said, it's a tough gig, you know how many licenses and inspections I got ta get to sell on of them'meteora' spells? The wait list and background checks to purchase a possessed blunderbuss can take weeks. And the taxes on oil have just about put them cat-eyed weirdos right out of business. Sometimes I barely make enough to keep the doors open what with every shouting dragon-brain peddling their dozens of iron daggers and leather helmets. But, truth be told, and what they do n't tell you at the merchants' guild, is you can donate all that unwanted trash to destitute monsters in need, get some tax breaks, and the cycle continues. But the hardest part, and the most rewardin' part, is dealin' with the customers. Even with all my perks, my level 99 in mercantile, and more than enough enchanted baubles and robes to raise my intelligence and charisma to tolerable levels, I have to take precautions. There are wards and buffs all over this place, in the walls, on the doors, in the ceiling. Hell, half the items on display are cursed. That do n't stop them thieves guild wannabes from trying to palm a poisoned necklace or make off with every last spoiled potion. Sometimes, you just got ta pretend to look the other way.

As the owner of the Little Shop at the End of the Realm, I offer anything one might need\u2014whether to slay a dragon, cast a spell, or embark on endless quests. If you want it, I've got it. However, I didn't choose this life; I wasn't an adventurer who took an arrow to the knee or rescued any princesses from ogres. I started as an orphaned dungeon rat, grafting my way up from selling cheap potions in caves and crafting boar-skin boxers, surviving on troll dung and mushrooms. My rise from the bottom was gradual but relentless. Yet, the tale doesn't end there. As I've mentioned, it's a tough gig\u2014obtaining licenses and undergoing inspections just to sell 'meteora' spells is an ordeal. The backlog and background checks for buying a possessed blunderbuss can stretch on for weeks, and high taxes on oil nearly drive some of my cat-eyed neighbors out of business. Sometimes, making ends meet is tough, competing with dragon-brained folks peddling their countless iron daggers and leather helmets. However, one secret the merchants' guild doesn't tell you is that you can donate unwanted items to needy monsters for tax benefits, and thus the cycle continues.

I began to panic slightly but then decided to gather my fighting men to their stations in wait. \"Come on ye landlubbers! We might need all the hands we can get.\" I shouted, eyes constantly trained on the flying enemy ship. It approached closer and closer, as if it were the sun itself. \"Man the canons! This here ship ain't about to go down without a fight\" I shouted. Dragon's Greed would survive up past the Heavens if it could. Finally the foreign ship was less than 30 feet away from us, it looked to be made out of shiny metal that the rain sizzled off of. \"Fire!\" I shouted, a volley of canons flew towards the ship, causing it to bounce off. The enemy ship glowed even brighter, encompassing our ship. Suddenly the air started to become warmer and warmer and then huge tentacles arose, pulling the foreign ship into the water. A burnt flesh smell wafted the air for a good few seconds. \"Golly! Sent them blokes to Davey Jones' Locker\" I shouted, letting out a sigh of relief.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 94, "wordsSpent": 622, "remainingCredits": 255799, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Within a month he started hearing the whispers. Within a year he had to walk through the aisles daily, brushing his fingers over the spines of the books just to `` ground out'' the energy.

As the senator handed his book over to Timothy at the counter, Timothy held it in his hands and thought furiously. `` Come back. Return. Come back. Buy one more.'' He willed the thought into the book. He gave the senator his book and change. `` Come again,'' he said out loud. And he did.

After that, Timothy was more subtle, more careful. The first book was always a simple `` come back.'' The second book was often `` bring a friend.'' And they came. Business was great. Then one day a controversial bill was presented in congress. Timothy was n't usually too strongly involved with politics, but this was his hot topic. It all clicked when one of his then many senators came in. It was almost too simple. He handed back the purchased book with a firm psychic push. `` Vote Yes on 875.'' And he did it again on the next representative, the next senator, the next lobbyist. Pundits were shocked at the vote. Timothy McGuire was shocked at how easy it was.

Rounding a granite-flanked corner, Jack caught sight of a crying child. Totally unaware that onlookers might take him for the faggoty creep he is, Jack ran to the young boy's aid. His bike lay strewn just off the sidewalk; his knee bloodied and swollen. `` You're fine, little fella. What happened?'' Jack asked in a friendly, borderline-retarded voice.

We were at a party. It was supposed to be a cookout for a baseball game, but it started raining, and Dave decided to order pizza instead of just using the stove in the kitchen. It felt a bit inconsiderate to me. I spent good money on those steaks, and I knew my freezer was n't enough to keep them in good condition. Plus I wanted to help cook; Dave bought a brand-new grill last month and I wanted to try it out. The commercials started again. I took out my laptop and went to Reddit, as usual.

I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. His face was a blank, emotionless mask. Even his eyes seemed lifeless, staring straight ahead with none of the tics or movements that would indicate a living, breathing organism. I stepped up to a urinal, then paused. I glanced at the man again. He was still standing there, staring straight ahead. He seemed to be waiting. I reached down towards my zipper, then hesitated. I made a decision. Instead of taking a piss, I turned around and faced the man. Still he stood, like a statue, his vacant gaze fixated upon a point just over my right shoulder. I looked him over from head to toe. He was definitely not one of the security personnel hired for this event. I knew all the other guys, and he was not one of us. He was definitely dressed in a security uniform, though, which led me to a disquieting conclusion: he'd taken a uniform from one of the other guards. I pondered confronting him directly. If he was trying to masquerade as a security guard, then he was probably trying to do something covertly. He might reveal something, or even flee, if he knew his cover's blown. Then again, he might not. Confronting him could quickly lead to a fight. The security staff were issued with tasers, as well as a sidearm. The bald man looked to be in fairly good shape, so if he had a taser and a gun, then it would be too risky for me to fight him. I decided I needed backup. I would finish my business in the bathroom, then contact my supervisor. We'd get the rest of the security staff and take this guy down together, before he tried anything. I turned back to the urinal. Before I could unzip, though, I felt a sharp prick in the side of my neck. I flailed my arms around wildly as I whirled around. The bald man was holding a half-empty syringe in his right hand. `` What the fuck? What did you just inject into me? What was that?'' I yelled at him. I felt faint, but did not lose consciousness. I could fight the drug off. Maybe it was because he was n't able to give me a full dose. I was surprised to hear a girl's voice reply. `` *What the... that's never happened before.

Hesitant, I moved my hand towards my zipper, but then stopped and decided to face him instead. He remained rigid, like a statue, his vacant gaze aimed just past my right shoulder. I scrutinized him from head to toe. He wasn't part of the security team for this event. I knew all the personnel, and he wasn't one of us. Yet, he wore a security uniform, suggesting a disturbing possibility: he had taken the uniform from one of the other guards. I considered confronting him.

Every day it happens. The Shift. Unsure what causes it, the origin no longer matters.Like trying to stop a bullet with your mind, shifting can not be stopped; you'd just end up getting shot.

Just when you think you've escaped this beast, going full circle the time that was lagging behind has turned up in front of you. Every day the cycle repeats. Sweat beads on your head. It's here. The last couple shifts have been rough. No longer holding count, the shifts become like how many nights you sleep; or at least try for sleep. The number is meaningless. numbers of Infinity. The worst part is not knowing what has changed. Every time the clock changes to 10:24 it happens. Something changes. You have no idea what it will be, or how it will affect you. Something happens. Closest you can guess is that you move between an infinite number of parallel universes. Time becoming a gate way into a whole new world, you shift. A country's name has changed. Shift. Your house number is changed. Shift. Pizza does n't exist. Shift. One of your classmates never existed. Shift. Your mother died in child birth. Shift. You have a different name. You never know the nature of these shifts. How much things can change in a single minute. The brief space between 10:23 and 10:25, is enough room for an entirely new universe to emerge.

That single moment, precisely at 10:24, brings about a profound change. Every day is a cycle. The sweat begins to drip down your brow. It's here. The recent Shifts have been particularly harsh. You've stopped keeping track, similar to the number of nights you attempt to sleep\u2014they blend into infinity. The most unsettling part is the uncertainty.

Leonard looked over at his old friend. They were sitting on a bench in Central Park, and this was Leonard's last-ditch effort to reclaim the childhood buddy he had known. Sid was once a knockout in both the bedroom and the boardroom. Sid was the envy of all his friends only a year ago. Now, Sid had morphed into a social pariah.

I was lost asserting myself over others I never saw the ultimate battle -- assertion over myself. I had been nothing more than a prisoner. The bidding I did for the machine of society was what had been my true existence.'' `` Listen to yourself, Sid!'' cried Leonard, `` You were doing no one's bidding. You were the man in charge, the alpha dog above us all. Why throw it away?'' `` Why throw away what my self, my *real* self never asked for? Every night in those days, I would wake up in tears.

Now, he had become a social outcast. Leonard hesitated, searching for the right words. \"Sid... why? Look at your situation!

You're correct; I once had everything a 25-year-old man was supposed to want.

Never would I forget the fear I felt when I saw the Captain's great black flags approach our ship. In front of me, I was amazed to see how many stars I could see.

First of all, I was extremely comfortable -- more than I had ever been during my 20-some years as a sailor. The second reason I was sure I was dead was because a beautiful girl with bright yellow hair was staring at me, her face not far from my face. I took a deep breath and began coughing. She rolled me over and I spit water onto the wooden floors. `` Where am I?'' I asked. My mouth was dry and my body felt stiff. The girl handed me a glass of water. It tasted odd. I heard footsteps approaching and managed to sit up. The girl backed away and opened the door. A large man entered. He had red hair that waved to his shoulders and a long beard. He stopped when he noticed I was awake. He exchanged a glance with the girl, who then lowered her head. `` Where am I, what's going on?'' I repeated, beginning to feel anxious. Outside, a bell began to chime and the large man tensed, looking towards the window. `` Cap'n is returning, lads!'' A voice called from somewhere else. I pulled myself up to the window, where I was immediately shocked to notice the cabin I appeared to be in was somehow surrounded by the sea. The large man walked up behind me and pushed me back down on the bed. `` I'll keep him hidden, papa,'' the girl said, eyes wide.

This'priest' did not worship a god like most Atlanteans did. He spoke of a miraculus paradise where the Atlantean people would not be disturbed by the greedy outsiders who coveted our enormous wealth and prosperity. We would be free to advance the sciences and the arts as we pleased, alone in blessed isolation. The paradise, so he said one quiet morning in the acropolis, was to the west. It was beyond where any had ever sailed before. He would holler and and scream and sing about this wondrous land of plenty, however there was a certain charisma to his mad ravings. Sometimes people listened and slowly, ideas took root. In a few years since he had first appeared in our faithful city, Cyrus had gained a large following. Attacks from the outsiders had grown and many seeked refuge from their onslaught. The popularity of Cryus' ideas grew greatly. Support was further compounded by these weird new inventions that he had shown off to the social elite of the city. Cyrus spoke of things that even our best philosphers had trouble understanding, however they could not argue against the results. The priest had made claims that he could construct a'propulsion system' that could carry the entire weight of our floating city amongst the clouds. Even some of his most fervent supportors had doubts, but as the outsider attacks increased it became clear that we had little option. Either put our faith in Cyrus, or be destroyed. Acquiring valuable parts for the construction was difficult. Certain parts could not be manufactored at home and needed to be purchased abroad. This was one of the most prominent problem in it's construction, as the outsiders had created an extensive blockade around our city. In order to solve this, Cyrus constructed a'submersible boat' that could sail *below* the waves. These submersibles would slip by the blockade and sail to many of the outsider cities where the agents within could purchase ( or steal ) supplies. During one of these excursions, one of our agents was discovered by an outsider philosopher. This man, after concluding the agent's Atlantean heritage from a tatoo on his forehead, asked to be taken with him to Atlantis and threatened to alert the authorities if he was turned away. The agent hesitantly agreed.

Acquiring the necessary parts for construction posed another challenge. Some components couldn\u2019t be manufactured locally and had to be sourced from abroad. This issue was prominent because the outsiders had established a formidable blockade around our city. To overcome this, Cyrus built a 'submersible boat' capable of sailing beneath the waves.

The Hive Council agreed that if he wise men of the Free Radicals could prove a maskless, non-recycled air part of the surface existed, they would be allowed to continue preaching their frivolous nonsense. There was some hesitation, but on the insistence of many of the younger followers, the eldest of the Free Radicals went to the surface with some of the young-rads to wander off from the old, derelict city centers and remove their masks. Senior members of the security task forces accompanied them to the ancient looking forests, long overgrown from nearly two centuries of nature running free. After two days travel the time had come.

We're hitting the wall of the pool hall on 3rd as hard as we possibly can, this time of day it should be pretty empty, but we need our boys on the inside to guarantee that. Once we're in, we scatter. You need to move quick and clean, I want every civilian tied up and blindfolded before they know what's going on. Put them in the back office and head for the stairs. In the basement there should be an old access shaft, according to the blueprints DJ got us, the tunnels underneath all lead to the same place, the public library. This is where we can relax, take your time getting upstairs, blend. There's an unlocked door leading up to the roof, we get there, and Bob is going to have our lift ready to the next roof over, right Bob? As you may know, that's the new Bencroft building, which lucky for us, is still under construction. Head to the other side, get on that railing, and boys - I'm afraid we'll have to jump. There should be a garden on the 18th floor, if our math is right, you'll land just fine. You'll go through the french doors, if they're locked, go through em anyway. Sam has been sitting on the place for weeks, so it should be empty if we time it right. Head downstairs - and Ben, take care of the security. Cameras, alarms, whatever they've got. The rest of you are heading to the old man's office, it should be on the same floor, the place is big, but you'll find it. Once you're in, I want you to take everything you can see, nailed down or not. Paintings, wine, and every fuckin' key he's got. Once you're ready, we take the lift downstairs, pick your ride, and drive the hell out of there. With any luck the cops will still be a block down wondering where the hell we went, and we'll be heading to the meet, free and clear. Relax now boys, it's going to be a long day. **I decided that using the Rube Goldberg machine from [ Ok Go - This Too Shall Pass ] ( http: //www.youtube.com/watch?", "text_ai_base": "Here's the plan: it's straightforward. First, we need a car. Cam, you're driving. I need you to speed down I-95 and take exit 14. Paul, make sure the car is bulletproof; we can't afford casualties. Cam, once the drive's done, you're off the hook. But here's the challenge: we're crashing through a brick wall. Specifically, we're hitting the pool hall wall on 3rd Avenue hard. It should be empty around this time, but our guys inside need to confirm that. Once we're in, we disperse. Move fast and efficiently; tie up and blindfold every civilian before they can react. Put them in the back office, then head for the stairs. In the basement, according to the blueprints DJ provided, there's an old access shaft. All tunnels below lead to the public library. That's our chance to blend in and relax. Take your time heading upstairs. There's an unlocked door that leads to the roof. Once there, Bob will have our transport ready to take us to the next building, right Bob? Fortunately, the new Bencroft building is still under construction. Cross to the other side, get on the railing, and prepare to jump. If our calculations are correct, you'll land safely in the garden on the 18th floor. Go through the French doors; if locked, break through. Sam has been monitoring the place for weeks, so it should be empty if we time it right. Head downstairs, and Ben, disable the security systems\u2014cameras, alarms, everything. The rest of you are heading to the old man's office on the same floor. It's a large place, but you'll find it. Once inside, grab everything in sight, whether it's nailed down or not\u2014paintings, wine, and every key available. When you're done, take the lift downstairs, choose your ride, and drive away fast. Ideally, the cops will still be a block away, clueless about our whereabouts, and we'll head to the meetup, free and clear.

Don't want any dead men, Cam, that's all I need out of you. You can sit back then, but listen. We are going to be driving through a brick wall. You heard me, I'm going to need you to be hitting the pool hall wall on 3rd Avenue at full force.

Sorry to be a corpse while I should have been supporting you. Sorry for not hearing you when I should have been listening.

His naked hand was resting on the steam engine's lever. `` We will discuss the histories of old during next period; the Imperator insists that this demonstration takes place within the allocated break time.'' Quintus fell back into silence, as had the rest of the class. They had been taking in the large mechanical wonder behind their professor, pondering what it could possibly be. Brutus pushed the lever into position, revealing two massive infernos beneath the twin chambers resting on the iron platforms. The class gasped at the hidden fires, some edging away, while others edged closer. Within minutes of the reveal, steam began billowing out of exhaust vents as the four giant gears started to turn in unison. From overhead, light began to pour into the room - startling the students. `` Do you understand what has just happened?'' Brutus took no time to wait for an answer, assuming the class understood rhetorical nature of his question. `` The steam generated by the boiling of the water in the twin cauldrons was forced through a series of pipes and propellers, which in turn drove the gears to turn.'' Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed at the central gear pair, without taking a moment \u2019 s break from his speech. `` These two gears each drove the smaller gear beneath them to move the iron rods attached in such a manner that they wound the roof up. As you may have noticed, the roof has been replaced with collapsible bronze plating, to allow for such an event as this.'' None of the students understood the implications of a functioning steam engine, but the display had been completed, which was all Brutus cared for. His position was not to showcase the Imperator's power, but to teach the youth of the empire the knowledge needed to separate them from the uncivilized heathens from which every direction was saturated with. `` If you have any questions, you may ask Professor Alexander, for he dabbles much more deeply in the sciences behind this than I.'' The class continued to murmur in awe of how steam was able to move metal, but it died down as the armoured hand of Brutus rose into the air as to silence them. `` So, as the impatient Quintus interjected with questions regarding past civilizations and our own histories, he will lead by setting the bar for basic knowledge that I will assume you all equally have.'' Motioning for Quintus to speak, Brutus pulled back the lever to silence the roaring fires behind him. `` Well...", "text_ai_base": "\"Quiet, Quintus,\" Brutus commanded as he stood at the front of the class, his armored hand gripping the marble podium. His bare hand rested on the steam engine's lever. \"We will discuss ancient histories next period; the Imperator insists this demonstration fits within our break time.\" Quintus and the rest of the class fell silent, captivated by the large mechanical marvel behind their professor, speculating on its purpose. Brutus pulled the lever into position, uncovering two fierce infernos beneath the twin chambers on the iron platforms. The class gasped in unison at the sight of the hidden flames, some students retreating while others leaned in closer. Minutes later, steam began to billow from exhaust vents as four massive gears turned in perfect harmony. Suddenly, light flooded the room from above, startling the students. \"Do you understand what just happened?\" Brutus asked, not waiting for a response as he assumed the class understood it was rhetorical. \"The steam produced by the boiling water in the twin cauldrons was channeled through pipes and propellers, causing the gears to rotate.\" Without pausing his explanation, Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed to the central gear pair. \"These gears each drove a smaller gear beneath, which moved the iron rods to open the roof. You'll notice it replaced with collapsible bronze panels for this exact purpose.\" Though the students didn't grasp the full implications of a functioning steam engine, the demonstration was complete. Brutus's goal wasn't to showcase the Imperator's power but to equip the empire's youth with the knowledge distinguishing them from the uncivilized hordes surrounding them. \"If you have questions, consult Professor Alexander, who delves deeper into these sciences than I do,\" he concluded. The class buzzed in awe at how steam moved the metal, but fell silent as Brutus raised his armored hand. \"Now, as Quintus has impatiently inquired about past civilizations, he will set the bar for our foundational knowledge.\" Signaling Quintus to speak, Brutus pulled back the lever to quiet the roaring fires. \"Well...\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\u201cHold your tongue Quintus,\u201d Brutus stated while standing at the front of the classroom, his armored hand pressed against the marble podium.

Quite what exactly happens to both of us when I'm'wearing' them is a bit of a grey area, but I'm willing to ignore that in the name of curiosity. So, I know what you're thinking, how did this happen? My entire life I've been critical of myself \u2013 the way I looked, the way I spoke, the way people perceived me. Throughout my teenage years I was bullied, this gave me so little confidence that I'd reached a very low point in my life and even considered committing suicide. I'd planned it out, everything was ready. My parents were away for the weekend, I'd purchased a length of rope, some Whiskey and had written a letter. I drank heavily, cried even heavier, reflected on life, stood on the chair with the noose around my neck and shut my eyes, ready for whatever waited on the other side.

How was anyone supposed to convince a judge and jury that Adolf Hitler, one of the most reviled humans in all of history, was deserving of a place in heaven? I had spent days pouring over his life-logs, attempting to find some point of argument, something that would let me build a case for this lost soul, but I had come up empty. For the first time ever, I was going to lose. I step up to the witness, none other than Mr. Hitler himself, and pose the big question. `` Why do you feel that you are deserving of a place within Heaven?'' His response was quick, and to the point. `` I believe that I was doing the work of god in my mission to create the perfect human being. It was all a quest to approach the magnificence of God, and to bring his light to those who scorn him.'' I was shocked. Mr. Hitler had given me the one chance to redeem his soul and he did n't even know it, the morality clause. The morality clause argues that morality is not a fixed paradigm, it is an ever moving target that one must strive for, and one must dedicate themselves to for their entire life. By saying that his intentions were to create the perfect society, one where each and every person approaches the pinnacle of Godliness, he was infact working towards his own personal moral code. He was not a sinner, in so much that he was freeing those that were against his moral code from the constraints of their earthly fetters, in an attempt to bring them closer to God. After making my argument, and watching the Jury file from the room, I slump in my chair, head in my hands. I had just found the one loophole that might get one of the worst people in all of history through the great pearly gates. Eventually I straightened, and prepared myself for the verdict.

My actions were aimed at approaching God\u2019s magnificence and spreading His light to those who rejected Him.\" I was stunned. Unknowingly, Mr. Hitler had offered a chance for redemption through the morality clause. This clause argues that morality isn\u2019t a static construct; it's a dynamic target we must continually aim for throughout our lives. By claiming his intent was to forge a perfect society where people could reach divine excellence, he suggested he was following his personal moral code. In his view, he wasn\u2019t a sinner; he believed he was liberating those opposing his beliefs, trying to guide them closer to God.

Their mole working in the Ministry of Protection was able to get us a map of the paths that the sentries walk, a spy in the Ministry of Architecture was able to pilfer the blueprints for the dome, a few members volunteered to martyr themselves in order to create a distraction, and, most importantly, we got the materials for an explosive device in a heist of the citadel's armory. We lost a lot of really good members along the way, Crazy Ben and Sam and Kelsie... and the twins... and John....and Carl... and... and.... Its OK though, they died for a good cause, and today is the day that their deaths gain true meaning. I need to get going though, its almost time to put the plan into action, and I'm one of the most important parts. I look at my girlfriend sleeping peacefully and think about how much different... how much better... of a world she will wake up in. Finishing that thought, I head out for the resistance headquarters, grabbing an apple from the kitchen as I walk through it. When I arrive at the HQ Max, the resistance leader, runs through the plan one last time. Jack, Luke and a collection of 15 or so others are going to go and create a diversion by rioting in the Northern Quarter Markets. I am going to go and rendezvous with some resistance members in the Western Quarter in an abandoned building near the edge of the city.

They've worked tirelessly to get someone outside, and now everything is falling into place.

The forest they had been searching was noisy with animals and insects. It was enough to cover their careful footsteps, but not enough to mask the voices nearby. The group crept silently through the brush until they got within sight of some fallen trees being used as benches for several men while others stood leaning against trees or pacing. They all wore raggedy clothes with mismatched leather armor. They carried dull looking short swords and a couple had crossbows. All together there appeared to be ten of them. They didn \u2019 t look like much of a challenge outside of the number advantage. Except for one near the middle of the group with a green cloak and a pair of sharp steel axes. This was their target. They had been hunting this man for a week now. The town they were last in had a bounty for him. His gang had been responsible for an attack on a school in which they had murdered a teacher and two students. This group had been carrying out similar attacks on seemingly random people in the same region and nobody seemed to know why, only that the man with the green cloak was always spotted in the same area that the attacks occurred. Kirov motioned for Tyd to circle around to the left of their current position, Zekk went with him. Kirov knew he could rely on Tyd to handle himself but Zekk was new to their group and inexperienced. Tyd had tried to teach him to shoot a bow but Zekk didn \u2019 t take to it very well. He did better with a sword but one day Tyd got the idea to give him a long slender tree branch that resembled the shape and weight of the broomstick he used to use at his last job. That seemed to work the best, so they \u2019 d crafted him a decent wooden staff and had been giving him lessons when possible. He hadn \u2019 t had any real fights yet, though, and a wooden staff wouldn \u2019 t hold up well against iron or steel, so for now he stuck with Tyd. Ten versus three wasn \u2019 t the worst odds they \u2019 d faced, but they would have to worry about keeping an eye on Zekk and make sure their target didn \u2019 t slip away while they fought.

No one knew why, only that the man with the green cloak was always seen in these areas. Kirov gestured for Tyd to circle left, taking Zekk with him. While Kirov trusted Tyd's abilities, Zekk was new and inexperienced. Tyd had attempted to teach Zekk archery, but Zekk struggled with it. He fared better with a sword, but Tyd eventually fashioned a wooden staff resembling a broomstick from Zekk's previous job, which seemed to suit him best. They had been training him when possible, though he hadn't been in combat yet, and his wooden staff wouldn't fare well against metal weapons. Thus, he remained close to Tyd.

He saw a group of men gathered, some choosing to sit on fallen logs, others choosing to prop themselves up against a tree or walk about.

Our government just made you wish that your species would have that referendum on receding to the monocultures. The hulk approached closer, as hulks are wont to do. It was amusingly complex, so over engineered that it was more a floating group of redundant systems than a ship. I tell you this so you understand better. You know what we face now. But then, we were innocent. We could not forsee the consequences. The hulk was an interesting object, nothing more. We were curious. We were fools. The first party entered the hulk without incident. Initial examinations found almost nothing living save single celled organisms. A few fungi were present, though so far removed that I almost insult their relatives to name them with the same term. The only thing of note was the vast amounts of thin cylinders on board. Thousands of them were found in sealed containers, etched intricately at the microscopic level. Hundreds were destroyed as we tried to extract the data, before some bright spark realised that the scratchings were in base 2. Further parties followed the first to aid in the exploration of the deeper areas of the vessel. That was when we found the guardian.

Recordings retrieved from the dead show it ignored those present until it had checked some form of terminal adjacent to its capsule. Then it paused, before keying a sequence of some sort. Once it saw what we had done, it started killing. It fought like no species our conglomerate had ever encountered. There was no warning. No decorum, just brutality. It crushed the neck of the researcher who awoke it while staring into its eyes. It thrust straight through two exo's with its forelimbs, before bludgeoning an invertebrate to a pulp with the corpses.

The hulk drew nearer, as hulks tend to do. It was an amusingly complex structure, so over-engineered it resembled more a floating assembly of redundant systems than a ship. I share this so you understand our situation better. You know what we face now, but back then, we were na\u00efve. We couldn't foresee the consequences. To us, the hulk was merely an intriguing object. Our curiosity made us foolish. The initial exploration team entered the hulk without incident. Their examinations found almost no life except for single-celled organisms. A few fungi were present, but they were so different that calling them fungi felt almost insulting to their relatives. The only noteworthy discovery was the vast number of thin cylinders onboard, thousands of which were intricately etched at a microscopic level and stored in sealed containers. Hundreds were destroyed during attempts to extract data, until someone realized the markings were in base 2. Subsequent teams ventured deeper into the vessel to aid in exploration. That's when we encountered the guardian. Initial scans missed it due to the primitive stasis it was in. A reckless scientist decided to awaken it, perhaps seeking personal glory. Recordings recovered from the dead show it ignored everyone until it checked a terminal near its capsule. Then, it paused before entering a sequence of some sort. Upon realizing what we had done, it began killing. It fought with a brutality our conglomerate had never seen before. There was no warning, no decorum\u2014just sheer violence. It crushed the neck of the researcher who awakened it while gazing into his eyes. It pierced through two exos with its forelimbs and bludgeoned an invertebrate to death with their bodies.

Once or twice a week she'd drift up from a deep slumber with a vivid picture of events to come, and in the twenty years she'd lived they had never been wrong. She'd come to trust the visions implicitly, but had only told one person of her prophetic dreams. Other people had, she learned, experienced a similar phenomenon; an inexplicable sense of deja vu that followed a dream of future events. However, none were as perfect and precise as hers, and for a long time it had scared her. The fear had faded with time, until she made the biggest mistake of her life. Normally her dreams were mundane. Bumping into a man on the street and spilling her coffee, missing her train, or forgetting her phone in the bathroom at work. Sometimes she would forget the dream within moments and events would transpire as predicted, the memory only coming to her again as they played out. Other times she would intentionally guide her life down the path of the dream, to see if she was right again. For the first time in her life Cassie deviated from her premonition, and wished more than anything that she had n't. It was such a simple thing, taking a different taxi to be on time for her appointment, but she had no idea of the consequences for her actions. Her dreams had changed as a result. The next night had been a nightmare, more vivid and terrifying than she could have imagined. She dreamed she was choking on smoke, struggling to crawl past dancing flames and to the door of an room she had never seen before. Wheezing, her face and hands seared to the bone, she collapsed from inhalation before waking in a cold sweat, the taste of smoke on her tongue. It ended up being an apartment fire a few blocks away from her home, a dozen people dead, and she had seen the devastation from the eyes of a woman who never made it out. Two nights later another dream, another disaster. This time a multiple car accident that took two lives. After that she vowed she would do what she could to stop the next nightmare. She would remember every detail of it, and keep it from happening. If she could take a different taxi, perhaps she could give someone a chance at life. She had n't been prepared to see her own death.

Dagny's short brown hair was drawn back into a bun and her thick black glasses masked her eyes. She was taking a second look over the essay she had written a week ago and gnawed on her tongue as if to punish herself for her lousy sentence structure. From behind her, she heard a knocking on what she only could assume was the front door and stood up to answer. She was somewhat relieved that her grandmother was early, because it meant that she could procrastinate on her essay for a while longer while they caught up wtih each other. She trundled down the stairs and opened the front door to her townhouse, only revealing bleak autumnal colors and scraping dry leaves on her door mat. She closed the door and twisted her brow into a frustrated, but curious distortion. Then, she heard a knocking again, but it was faint- coming from her room. She felt her body stiffen for a moment, frozen with fear as she looked at the door frame of the room. She remembered some sage advice from her best friend, Laquisha: `` only these dumbass white motherfuckers run upstairs in horror movies, that's why they always get killed, shiiit.'' She knew Laquisha was right, and she also knew that although she was white, she was n't a dumbass white mothefucker. Nonetheless, the knocking did spark her curiosity. She had opened the closet only a half hour ago and had n't left the room since then. Whatever was knocking on her closet door was not a rapist or a robber, and she did n't take the idea of monsters very seriously, or really anything paranormal. If it was something paranormal, why would it knock? Why not barge in and destroy her completely? Whatever it was, she was a bio-med major, and if it was something weird, maybe something... new, she wanted to see it. She wanted to discover it. She had to investigate- her curiosity outweighed her fear, and even if Laquisha called her a dumbass motherfucker later, she had to know what was behind the closet door. She armed herself with a baseball bat she kept under her couch and crept slowly upstairs. She came to the closet and the knocking continued- three more paced, even knocks. They dropped a sense of dread into her tummy as she realized that she had crossed the mental point of no return. She inched her hand toward the door, feeling terror consuming her as her fingers wrapped around the metal knob.", "text_ai_base": "Every Tuesday at 3 PM, Dagny sat at her desk, as she usually did, reviewing her work before having tea with her grandmother, who was due to arrive soon. Her short brown hair was pulled back into a bun, and thick black glasses obscured her eyes. As she reread an essay she had written a week ago, she bit her tongue in frustration over its clumsy sentence structure. Suddenly, a knock sounded from what she assumed was the front door. Relieved that her grandmother might be early, she welcomed the chance to procrastinate on her essay while they caught up. She made her way down the stairs and opened her townhouse door, only to be met by the dreary autumn hues and dry leaves rustling on the doormat. Disappointed and perplexed, she shut the door. Then, she heard a more subdued knocking, this time from her room. Fear gripped her, freezing her in place as she stared at the room's door frame. She recalled her best friend Laquisha's words: \"Only those clueless characters in horror movies run upstairs. That's why they get killed.\" Dagny knew Laquisha was right, and she prided herself on not being one of those clueless characters. Yet something about the knocking piqued her curiosity. She had opened the closet just half an hour before and hadn't left the room since. Rationalizing that whatever was behind the closet door couldn\u2019t be a threat, she dismissed the idea of anything paranormal. Why would a ghost or monster knock politely instead of barging in? A biomedical student, Dagny felt a compelling desire to explore any strange phenomenon. Her curiosity triumphed over fear, and ignoring the potential of Laquisha calling her a fool later, she decided to investigate. Grabbing a baseball bat from under the couch for protection, she cautiously headed back upstairs. As she approached the closet, the measured knocking continued\u2014three evenly spaced knocks.

She bit her tongue as she read an essay she wrote the week before, annoyed by her sentence structure. Knock-knock-knock It sounded like someone was knocking at her door. The front door, she assumed. The essay. It had so many errors. She wondered if she would have time to finish before her grandmother arrived. It may be her at the door right now.

I know it has been quite some time since your last session with her, Master Wa -- Yes, I suppose she did say it would be good to find some outlet for your pain but I hardly think vigilantism is what she had in mind. No boy should have to bear the burden forced upon you, I understand that sir, but you are still young. I know from your tutors you've excelled in every course you have taken at school, no doubt you are clearly quite exceptional. No I'm not trying to flatter you Master Wayne, merely show that I understand where you are. You are highly intelligent Master Wayne. Thomas, your father, always saw that in you. He never told you, worried it might get to your head, but he would always tell your mother what high aspirations he had for his little genius. It's simple genetics really, both of your parents were some of the finest minds in Gotham. It was my distinct pleasure to be at their service and evidently they raised a very intelligent young man. A caring one at that. You have the heart of your mother. But the world is bigger than myself or even you can fathom in its entirety Master Wayne. I used to help your father with the Wayne Foundation work, did you know that? Your father spent hours trying to help those at the bottom of our society. And even your father, with his brilliance, his resources and his unwavering spirit struggled to find the light in the darkness. This city is steeped with evil Master Wayne, and I am so sorry you had to experience that. But even your father knew that it would take more than one man to rid Gotham of its corruption. Of the darkness. I'm not sidetracking... yes I know you've heard it all before Master Wayne but you must see. Dr Thompkins has made it quite clear that this guilt, your guilt, is going to remain for quite some time. You must see that in no way could you have stopped what happened from happening. Sometimes the wind blows so hard we can not even take the first step against it. And Gotham is a hurricane. You were merely a boy, and as fast as you are growing, a fourteen year old is still a boy.

I\u2019m not just trying to flatter you; your father, Thomas, always saw your potential. He never wanted to tell you directly, worried it might go to your head, but he shared with your mother his high hopes for you, his little genius. It's natural, given that both your parents were among Gotham\u2019s brightest minds. Serving them was an honor, and they raised a caring, intelligent young man. Your empathy echoes your mother\u2019s heart. The world, however, is far more complex than we can fully understand, Master Wayne. I assisted your father with the Wayne Foundation, did you know? He dedicated countless hours trying to uplift society's marginalized, yet even he, with all his brilliance and resources, found it challenging to illuminate the surrounding darkness. This city is swathed in evil, and I'm deeply sorry you witnessed it. Your father recognized that it would take more than a single man to eradicate Gotham\u2019s corruption and darkness. I\u2019m not digressing, and I know you've heard this before, but it's crucial to realize that Dr. Thompkins emphasized your guilt may persist for a while. Understand that nothing you could have done would have changed the past. Sometimes, life\u2019s challenges are like a raging storm, making it impossible to take that first step.

No one roots for the hero in real life. You can call me the Detective. You don't get my real name. I'm a hero. Or at least I like to think that I am. I don\u2019t have any powers. I didn\u2019t come from outer space; I wasn't bathed in radiation or even bitten by a spider. Batman didn\u2019t have any powers either, I suppose; other than being a billionaire. I just remind myself that Batman wouldn\u2019t have walked away: Batman wouldn\u2019t mind giving up the Batcave for this dilapidated, rat-infested factory. Batman could take the loneliness of not having a butler or a boy wonder, or the cold nuked dinners, or a lumpy mattress and waking up with a sore back. Batman would take the public spotlight of all the media wagging their fingers and the Mayor bucking for your ass. Yeah, I forgot to tell you about the Mayor, didn\u2019t I? He\u2019s the reason I'm a hero in my own mind now. And why I grew out of reading comic books. The good guys don\u2019t win. Not when the bad guy packs a coterie of thugs, owns half of the businesses in town, owns half of the papers in town, and damn near all of the radio stations here. Not when the police commissioner is on a leash. He bought his way into office and I was the only one to object. The Mayors power his isn\u2019t super strength but influence. In comic books, it\u2019s easy, unearth the bad guy\u2019s plot and confront him in the end and win. I can do that. Piece of cake.

Started as a weird illness here and there, give it three weeks and people are eating each other like they're all an all-you-can-eat human buffet. They got me about 4 weeks ago. I held out with my two little kids and my beautiful wife when they finally knocked down the door. I took down dozens with my old rifle but eventually they overwhelmed us. I do n't like thinking about that. Honestly the turning was n't bad. No pain, just a warmth, like a blanket on a frosty winter's day. It did n't take me long to realise that I was exceedingly different from the rest of the zombies. Some slight changes to my physical appearance, sure. For one, I was a lot paler now. Hearing your heart not beat is a really weird experience. I had a leg drop off the other week, I wound up sewing it back on and was stunned when the bloody thing actually still worked. I re-adjust the burlap sack hanging from my shoulders. Thank god zombies are strong, otherwise this would be a real pain. Anyway, as I was saying. A lot changed in those first few weeks. I spent most of them trying to get through to my family, hoping something reminiscent of what they used to be was still alive in there. Zip. Nada. Just mindless shufflers like the rest of them. I finally get to the doorstop of my home and shuffle my hand around for my keys. I finally find them at the bottom, sitting next to something strange. I pull it out and am immediately irritated to find myself staring at my pinky finger. Just something else I'll have to sew back on. My keys make a familiar clunk as they turn the pins in the lock, and I swing my door open. I smile as I see my family sitting at the table. Probably not too surprising honestly, considering I tied them to the chairs. I heft the sack off my shoulders and lift the heavy contents. Looks about 24 years old. Somehow amazingly un-turned.

He let out a creepy laugh before charging at you.'What are you-' He grabbed you before you could say anything else. He got a knife from the kitchen board.'Let me help you get out of those.' He let go of his grip for a second and you got loose.'Get off me!' It was useless. He tackled her and this time held a firm grip on her. He used his knife to rip of your pants.'A fighter, I like fighters.' You heard his zipper going down.'Stop! Please, take anything you want, let me go!' You felt fear, anger and something else. He tried to take off the last peices of clothing.'GET OFF ME!' Everything turned into a blur, but you did n't feel any pain. You did n't hear him anymore. The dripping of water was the only thing left you could hear. Everything else was filtered out. You looked at the burned heap of flesh in front of you. A tear fell down your cheek. You could feel the terror in your father's eyes. He looked at you like you were n't his daughter but a threat.

And Red was so smug about his victories, never saying a single word, just letting resentment fester and turn into anger, then rage.

Red stepped back at looked at Gary, signaling that it was his turn to choose. `` Finally,'' Gary said to himself. `` This is my chance to finally become better than Red.''

As I opened my eyes, I quickly saw\u2026 nothing, as the deep darkness completely owned the room. Pulling my phone out of my pocket and turning on my flashlight app, I grumbled about taking trips to ancient cities and becoming lost in creepy alleyways as stalkers followed you.

It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually it *was* yesterday. It took that long to nail down the final confirmation. For months we had been calibrating our detector design, with the eventual aim of observing gravitational radiation from black holes, neutron stars and other celestial bodies. Gravitational wave detectors would open up vast new vistas for astronomy, but the darn things were super-sensitive. We spent months chasing down the tiniest anomaly before we found its source. In the end, the trace was unmistakable in the data. Mirror, mirror on the wall. The implications were enormous: every reflective surface was actually a portal to another dimension. The very word `` reflective'' was a misnomer: photons left our universe and entered another one, and counterpart photons entered ours. Gravitational waves did the same, although they were attenuated by many, many orders of magnitude for some reason as they passed through the interdimensional interface. We're still not sure why. There's a paradox though, which is a bit complicated to explain: our universe would n't exist without symmetry breaking. For example, if matter and antimatter were exact opposites, they would have been produced in equal amounts in the Big Bang, yet there is a tiny disparity, a baryon asymmetry, which has shaped everything around us. Parity violation is another example of symmetry breaking, and that's the problem. It was discovered in 1957 and immediately warranted a Nobel Prize. Parity violation tells us that the mirror dimension must have subtly different physics, in some unknown way. Yet events in the mirror faithfully `` reflect'' -- pun intended -- everything that happens in our dimension. How to explain that contradiction? It was late at night as I stood in the washroom of the research institute. I stared at my counterpart in the mirror. `` How are you different? ``, we said to one another. Obviously, there was no echo. Sound ca n't traverse the portal, since it is a phenomenon of matter, which always remains confined to its own dimension. `` What exists in our world that does n't exist in yours, or vice versa?'' `` We do'', said the voice behind my shoulder, as I stared at an empty room in the mirror. Funny accent, I thought. Transylvanian perhaps.", "text_ai_base": "I'll never forget the day we discovered gravitational waves coming from mirrors. It feels like it was just yesterday. In fact, it *was* yesterday. We finally confirmed it after months of work. For months, we had been refining our detector design with the goal of observing gravitational waves from black holes, neutron stars, and other celestial phenomena. These detectors promised to revolutionize astronomy by offering new insights. But they were incredibly sensitive, and we spent months tracking the smallest anomaly until we identified its source. Ultimately, the trace was clear in the data: mirrors emitted gravitational waves. The implications were immense\u2014every reflective surface was a gateway to another dimension. The term \"reflective\" was misleading; photons crossed between universes, while counterpart photons entered ours. Gravitational waves did the same, though they diminished significantly when passing through the interdimensional interface; the reason remains unknown. There's a paradox here, complex to explain: our universe relies on symmetry breaking for existence. For instance, if matter and antimatter were truly opposites, they would have formed equally during the Big Bang; however, a slight discrepancy, known as baryon asymmetry, shaped our universe. Parity violation is another example, discovered in 1957 and worthy of a Nobel Prize. It suggests the mirror dimension must have different physics in some subtle way. Yet, events in the mirror perfectly mimic\u2014pun intended\u2014everything that happens in our dimension. How can this contradiction be explained? Late at night, I stood in the washroom at the research institute, gazing at my reflection. \"How are you different?\" we asked each other. There was no echo. Sound can't cross the portal, as it's matter-based and remains within its own dimension. \"What exists in our world that doesn't in yours, or vice versa?\" \"We do,\" answered a voice behind me, as I looked into an empty room in the mirror.

Rebels started showing up in our neighborhood, and many of them were wounded. Bloody, awful wounds, and their screams were so loud. My younger siblings would cover their ears and hide in the corner whenever they heard them, with their ungodly wails.

I rub my eyes; my knuckles come away slick and cool with tears. Prying open my eyes again, I squint around me through bleary slits... then gawk through saucers. Have I slipped from one dream to another? No, I wince - the pain coursing through this old man's body makes a convincing argument against that. No, I'm awake now - but where on God's green earth am I? Shifting my weight, I prop myself up on one arm - good grief, that's cold!

No, I could n't be - no jail I've ever heard of looks like this: no bed, no windows, just rows of cages with a single, dim, white light along the ceiling above the central aisle. For that matter, I've never heard of a jail that would leave people naked on the floor... except maybe Guantanamo. God, am I in some secret government prison? But what did I do? Another look around though, reveals that this is no American prison - nor that of any developed nation I've ever heard of. No, there's something about the architecture: the lines, the colors, none of it feels right. It's all so utterly foreign, so terribly... Suddenly, I realize that one sound has followed me from the last nightmare into this one: somewhere nearby, a small child is crying. I am not alone. Through the gloom and the bars I see what must be the huddled shapes of prisoners in adjacent cells.

When i was a young man my mentor led me to a great hall near my village, it was a special place, one where young warriors of great potential would be presented with a weapon of great power, one that would help them fulfill their destiny. I passed through the doors of the hall alone, my mentor had told me that he was not worthy of the honour and waited behind. I wandered into the great hall wondering which weapon would choose me I was by far the greatest warrior my village had ever produced. I had bested every oponent i ever faced and could outwit even the smartest foe. I was on my way to becomming a great general. I knew i was worthy of only the greatest weapon. I passed excalibur and mjolnir, fine weapons indeed but weapons of royalty. Even though i knew i was worthy of such finely crafted items i also viewed them with a certain amount of disdain. These were the weapons of oppressors, people who ruled but didnt care much for the people they ruled. I wouldve been greatly disappointed had i been chosen by such a weapon. Thankfully it was not meant to be. I passed many other finely crafted weapons, all adorned with rare metals and precious gems, each one more beautiful and fearsom than the last, but none called to me. I had just about finished exploring the hall and was going to give up, perhaps i would not recieve my weapon, perhaps i was not destined to be a great general as i had thought. Then suddenly i heard my name being called. I followed the voice. The mysterious voice led me past all the weapons, past the swords and hammers, the axes and bat'leths. It led me to a table situated at the end of the hall. I looked upon the table and saw..... nothing! No sabres, no daggers, not even a tiny little arrowhead. All that was on the table was a feather, surely this feather wasnt the object calling me. I picked it up and examined it, this is when i realised that this was no feather, it was a quill.

The rent was eight hundred and fifty dollars a month, which included electricity and water, but not cable television or internet access. We had an in-suite dishwasher. Four washing machines and four clothes dryers were located in a room down the hall for communal use by all the tenants on our floor. I did not know Lucifer before he moved in. We met due to an advertisement I placed on Craigslist. My former roommate, Brian Petersen, had been offered a promotion, which required him to relocate to Dallas, Texas. Brian had been a good roommate. He was tidy and rarely noisy. Sometimes we would play PS4 together in the living room. A couple times a week, we would order a pizza or Chinese food and split the cost right down the middle. His rent check was always on time and his girlfriend Roberta once introduced me to her friend Sandra, who was kind and beautiful, even though we did not have a natural connection to each other. When Brian moved to Dallas, I placed an ad on Craigslist for a new roommate. Lucifer, Son of the Morning, was the only person to respond. When he came for the interview, I was surprised to find out that he was Middle Eastern and also an older gentleman. There are not many Middle Easterners who immigrate to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and certainly not in their sunset years. However, I needed someone to assume Brian's share of the rent and, other than his age and heritage, Lucifer seemed to be a quiet and dependable person. After a brief tour, I explained the apartment complex by-laws, including the regulations concerning pets, noise after ten at night, and reservation of the courtyard gazebo and barbecue. Lucifer smiled and signed on the spot a sublease I had prepared in advance. On the day he moved in, Lucifer immediately began to seek concessions to suit his comfort. He demanded that we replace the blinds with thick, red, velvet curtains, even though the blinds were fixtures belonging to the apartment complex itself. He asked that I move my fifty inch LED TV into my bedroom, even though the bedroom was not a large enough space for a screen of that dimension.

The 36-year-old made headlines two years ago when she became the youngest SpaceX employee to be promoted to Colonial Commissioner. Now she is in charge of operations at The Jovian System, and currently finds herself in low-orbit around Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter. She gave an irate sigh at this exacerbated question. Having just informed Director Musk, the most powerful man in the solar system, of intelligent radio communication on what was supposed to be an uninhabited system, she expected more than this reply. `` A 38 minute delay in communication and this is all he has to say... Fuck's sake, he probably thinks the team is picking up its own ground scanning signals. How incompetent does he believe us to be?'' Mark, one of the pilots of the mission and the only other person on-board the orbiter, kept his intense focus on his work. `` Probably just as shocked as we are,'' he said as he ruled out the use of modulation techniques on the signal. He was confident he could decipher the radio clicks quicker than the team of experts back on Earth. Besides, he had a head start, and they still had to relay their findings across vast amounts of space. `` The Galileo project showed habitable conditions, and JUICE proved definitively that no life was on the surface. We're all just trying to figure out what the hell is going on.'' A screen in front of Mark showed the constant and unmistakably intelligent signal, as received by the team on the surface and relayed back to them where they were hovering in geostationary orbit. The signal varied in amplitude, frequency, and phase, but there was clear no methodology behind this. The only controlled variable seemed to be the length of the pulses and the length of the gaps between pulses. Almost like an advanced Morse code, Mark thought to himself, just utilising a larger variable set. `` Ania,'' he kept scribbling on his note pad, `` the manner in which this code varies... It's not modulation. There's no structure, no pattern.'' He looked up at her, `` I think it's organic.'' `` You mean someone, *something*, is speaking to us in electromagnetic waves?'' She glanced at the Earth-link again, hoping for something more, something she can act on. `` Well it's certainly not like anyth...'' Mark broke off. He dashed down a rough table on a clean slate of paper, feverishly inserting values. `` Oh, God. They're using our UPC encoding.''

Seriously? He probably assumes we're picking up our own ground scanning signals.

Confident he could decode the clicks faster than the Earth-based experts, he appreciated his head start since they still had to relay findings across space. \"The Galileo project indicated habitable conditions, and JUICE confirmed no life on the surface.

Another victim. Help me out, Russ.'' Russell O'Malley. He's new to the Homicide department, and his nerves certainly show it.

Ted mulled it over for a minute trying to think of the best and easiest way to convey his meaning. Out in the golden street before him Tiff and Aubrey chatted happily pointing and discussing the beautiful golden apples that grew in abundance on a large tree. His two beautiful wives, captured in the pinnacle of their beauty. Their presence filled him with an insurmountable joy, but also an incredibly nagging apprehension.

Sitting there on that golden bench, in the pleasant breeze Ted grappled with his pestering predicament. Nat was a good friend, but only a friend he'd known in the afterlife. In his bodily form, Nat lived and died many years before Ted. Natson Henry Copper, was his name. He was born English and his voice still held that distinct Londoner accent hammered in by years of leisurely living, sprinkled with raucous events, that gave flavor to his tone and expression.

It called out to me, it told me to turn around. I froze. This was the most terrifying thing I had ever experienced.

It did n't make a noise. It spoke to me internally, with a different voice than my own, one I could n't control.

It had been ten days since they crossed into the Black Side and three since they dropped off the kid, and the crew was on edge. It had been 10 years since anyone had attempted an expedition to the Dark Continent, and they always ended the same. Sailors would land on the eerily hot sand, collect plant samples, and dig some holes and pan rivers for precious metals or gems ( *never* finding a damn thing ). But it was only a matter of time before the natives came and attacked everyone. `` Attack *the torch carriers*'', Sir William had said when Norris first tried to talk him out of this crazy mission. `` They always first attack sources of fire. I wo n't be needing a torch, so I wo n't have that problem.'' Norris had chuckled. He felt bad for the kid. Sir William Mason, at age 16, was the oldest person that had ever lived with Sun Sickness. His affliction was an incredibly common one that affected roughly one in ten newborns. Their weird little eyes ( if you could even call them that ) were incredibly sensitive to light and their skin blistered almost immediately in the sun. No amount of clothing or covers seemed to be completely effective at blocking the sun's effects, and children rarely lived to see their second birthday. It had become common practice to kill newborns with Sun Sickness to spare them from their few years of pain, and the High Priest had even endorsed this as a form of mercy. But William's parents could not bear to kill their firstborn and resolved to find a way to allow him to live comfortably. They had a wing of their mansion completely sealed from the sun and hired blind servants and tutors to raise the boy in his own little world. When the time came to train him how to get around in the dark, everyone was amazed that he had completely perfect night vision. He grew up comfortable, but restless. `` I was living in a five-room prison when there was a whole half a planet devoid of sun,'' William had said through the little communication slit of his box ( the oddest piece of cargo Norris had ever hauled ). `` The Dark Continent is where I belong. I'm sure of it. What if the natives are just like me?

Inevitably, the natives would arrive and attack. \"They always go for the sources of fire first,\" Sir William had warned when Norris initially tried to dissuade him from this reckless mission. \"I won't need a torch, so that's one less worry for me.\" Norris had laughed at this. He felt sorry for the kid. Sir William Mason, at age 16, was the oldest known survivor with Sun Sickness, a common affliction affecting about one in ten newborns. These children had peculiar, nearly light-blind eyes, and their skin blistered almost instantly under the sun. Even extensive clothing or coverings couldn't fully shield them, and most didn't live beyond their second birthday. Euthanizing infants with Sun Sickness had become accepted as a merciful act, endorsed by the High Priest. But William's parents couldn't bring themselves to end their firstborn's life and instead created a sunproof wing in their mansion, employing blind servants and tutors to raise him in an insulated world. When it was time to teach him to navigate in the dark, it was astonishing how perfect his night vision was.

The truth is that there are plenty of other prompts that are more deserving of your attention than this.

Remember the blonde, bespectacled, necrophilic coroner that you came up with nearly a year ago? You could hint at her proclivities by stating that she `` likes to play with her food.'' Hmm, what was her name? Maybe this could do? A phrase prompt: [ `` At my third birthday party the cake only had two candles. `` ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20u9sx/wp_at_my_third_birthday_party_the_cake_only_had/ ) You could easily write some sort of changeling story, of a fantasy or a sci-fi bent. You could do a story about a time-distorted world, where the protagonist ages normally but celebrates his birthdays out of order for some reason. This prompt has plenty of possibilities to it that /u/Future-Starter's little meta-prompt does not. Oh! I just saw a *really* good one! Another phrase prompt: [ `` Can I buy just one bullet? `` ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20rudv/wp_can_i_buy_just_one_bullet/ ) Is it a suicide? A murder? A frame-up, perhaps? Aha! Maybe the protagonist is searching for a *specific* bullet! Her partner shot her with a real bullet as part of a ruse that threatened, but ultimately saved, her life, at the price of her partner's! She lives in a society where bullets removed from bodies are resold and melted down as scrap metal, and she wants to buy the bullet that was removed from her body, to keep it as a memento of her partner's life! Well, yes, Cobbie, I'll admit that that's a bit far-fetched, but so many great stories are! Take a risk! Crawl out of your tiny little shell!

The glint of the rifle \u2019 s scope was barely visible up so high towards the rooftops, but it was unmistakeable. Before Perjury could make a single move, a single shot rang out in the chamber. The bullet flew down and hit its mark, the bridge of Perjury \u2019 s nose. His head exploded in a shower of blood, killing the villain immediately in a spectacular and efficient fashion. His lifeless body flopped down onto the cold concrete floor, the one sided battle well and truly over. A rope descended from the rafters, and the Marksman rappelled down to join The Iron Fist, his imposing rifle hanging off of his shoulder. \u201c Nice shot my friend, now get me the hell out of these shackles! \u201d Without a word, the Marksman, a slender, fit man with a grim expression and tinted glasses masking his eyes roughly yanked off The Iron Fist \u2019 s restraints.

The Executioner? Come on man, you pick this time. \u201d The Marksman stared wordlessly at The Iron Fist, his face a mask behind his glasses.

He cursed himself for being caught so easily; his fists had saved him countless times before, but now they were powerless. Desperately, he scanned the room for an escape, but Perjury, the grinning villain before him, had designed a foolproof plan. Though The Iron Fist had often slipped from his grip, this time escape seemed impossible. \"No? Then prepare to die!\" Perjury threatened, raising his fist over the button that would tear The Iron Fist apart. Suddenly, The Iron Fist broke his silence. \"Take the shot! Take the shot, goddammit!\" Perjury\u2019s gaze snapped to the rafters of his secret hideout, his heart sinking. The glint of a rifle scope was just visible up high, unmistakable. Before Perjury could react, a single shot echoed through the chamber, striking the bridge of his nose. His head exploded in a spray of blood, ending the villain quickly and decisively. Perjury's lifeless body crumpled to the cold concrete floor, the one-sided battle finally over. A rope descended from the rafters, and the Marksman rappelled down to join The Iron Fist, his formidable rifle slung over his shoulder. \"Nice shot, my friend.

And I liked the color. Plus it was my size and that never happens. I also found a pretty sweet road bike but it was too expensive. And it was n't my size anyway. The sweater was like a teal green. A full zip hoody. It was more sage colored now. And it currently has a handgun in the left pocket. It's not mine. I normally make a habit out of putting everything I need in that pocket.

Keys in right, phone in left jeans, lighter in my right jeans, wallet in back right, my cigarette case in my back left. It's systematic, and I've been doing it since middle school.

I peeked and saw my keys on the table through my window. I had to climb up to my bedroom window and crawl in. And then when I put them in the pocket I already have my door key there. It was n't on my key ring. It was already in the pocket. `` Damn, when did I do that?'' Like magic. This other time I was downtown and lost my wallet in a bar somewhere. And when I tried to enter my favorite bar, my ID was in the pocket. And when I explained to my friends I could n't buy drinks cuz I was broke i found a fresh fifty in the pocket. `` How? I do n't know. Get me a beer. This is messing me up man.'' It was a good thing too, I totes ended up going home with someone. And we end up dating for like six months. That night I find one my condoms from home in the pocket. Like RIGHT when I needed it. It started get bad though. If I did n't have the sweater, I'd get home and find all my stuff in the pocket.

We'll annihilate you with one shot.\" \"You'll find that quite unlikely,\" said the Commander. \"This is a Class 101 Fighter. Your so-called weapon would take several cycles to breach our shields. This is your last warning. Leave. Gunner, target their bridge.\" The Pampillian General gave the Vanquist Commander a piercing glare. \"Fire.\" The Vanquist Commander ordered. The rail gun hummed, and a silvery streak connected the starships. The shields flickered but held strong. \"Return fire!\" the Pampillian General shouted, clenching the console in frustration. \"Remember, Commander, you asked for this.\" Multiple flashes erupted from the torpedo bays and locked onto their target but passed through it without effect. The torpedoes corrected their paths, diving into the starship repeatedly until they ran out of fuel. \"What happened?\" The gunner checked his readings and shrugged. \"Not sure, General. They encountered no resistance. According to the scans, there's nothing there.\" \"Detonate the torpedoes anyway,\" the General instructed, watching the reports on his screen. Moments later, the torpedoes exploded. The star fighter's image flickered, but more intriguingly, a faint light flashed to the right. \"What was that?\" \"Displacer Cloaking Technology. We can't see them, General. Wherever the image appears, the real ship is nearby, but not where we see it,\" the gunner explained. \"Then target the area around the illusion,\" the General ordered, as another rail gun blast grazed his shields. \"As you command, sir.\" A barrage of torpedoes launched into the surrounding space around the fighter's image.

I asked. `` The building of Vayus was not without action if it is boredom you are so worried about,'' he explained patiently. `` The hill tribes killed many young men and violated countless young women before our forefathers drove them back into the mountains.''

Her eyes dimmed like blown-out candles. `` I mean... can you love now? With all that... junk in your brain?'' I could feel my eyes tightening like red-hot coils. I felt like some part of me was.. untethering. Letting go. Dimming out. Sometimes I wish I could just -- no. breathe. Rein it back in. Stay here. `` I can love,'' I said, `` just like you can.

Dark spots. Things happened that I do n't remember. Bad things; I know, because I'd come back to awareness a few times with blood on my knuckles. I turned from her and searched the patio of the coffee shop for something, anything, to cool me down.

I turned back to Ela as she spoke. `` Jonsan. I did n't mean it.'' I nodded enough to let her know she'd been heard.

But maybe not looking at her made it worse, because it made the disgust in her voice that much clearer. `` Look, I'm sorry. I did n't mean to hurt your feelings, okay? It's just... hard. Getting used to it. You. We thought you were dead, after that accident.'' So did I. `` We came to terms with it. Accepted it. This is hard for us, too.'' Her voice wavered a little, and once I may have felt sorry for her. I may have touched her hand and comforted her. But instead, I felt the darkness creeping in. I was losing it, losing touch again, I could n't let it - `` Listen, fucko. This is n't easy for me, either. How the hell do you think it is for me?''

I looked back up as Ela said something, \"Hey!\" Oh. Jonsan. I didn't mean it.\" Was I looking at her now? I nodded to say I was listening. Why wasn't I looking at her? Because she would see my powdered blue eyes, and the tightening would come back. Because when I don't look at her the revulsion in her voice makes me angry. \"Ela, please.\" I blew out in a tired voice, \"C'mon Don't talk to me like that.\" My fists clenched.

My finger pulsed quickly with the heartbeat of the woman -- Linda -- sitting across from me. A woman I had not met until today.

A way to always feel the other's fast beating heart when we stared into each other's eyes. A way to feel each other's heart when we were a thousand miles away. But one day, ten years ago, the pulsing stopped. She had worn it throughout the treatment. I kept it on as well, even as her spikes and dips agonized me. Even as her heart slowed and my eyes filled with tears and the pulse I had become so used to disappeared. She had willed her ring to her sister, Ally. That tore me up.

And Ally kept refusing me, until she would n't talk to me anymore. Until I stopped even getting a Christmas card from her and Kyle. So all I had left was my ring. My ring that had n't pulsed in a decade. Until -- `` So, how did you get that ring?'' I asked. She took a tentative sip of the steaming tea she had set for the two of us. Her green eyes leveled with mine. `` My aunt gave it to me. And she got it from a friend, who got it from someone in her book club.

My parents did n't even take me to church as a kid. As soon as I started getting calls though, I got the feeling that this was big. I bought and read every religious text that I could find. The Bible? Of course. The Quran? Sure. I even read The Book of Mormon. The best stuff that I could find on God coming to earth though came from the Gospels. As I started to read those, I could n't keep myself from laughing. I finally understood what the hell everybody was doing going to all these random places looking for Mr. Almighty. A bunch of them would go to churches and temples which is obvious. Others would go to soup kitchens, half-way houses, brothels, courts and philosophy seminars. These were a bit better. The ones that killed me though were the guys that were going by the docks asking if any of the local fishermen had mysteriously up and quit in the last couple of weeks. What? Do these people think that God has no creativity? There is no way He's going to do the same old thing the second time around. None of these theories, even the good ones, did it for me though. I was thinking way smaller. I have spent the last few weeks hanging out in cheap diners. The more unambiguous the better. Every one that I could find I would spend a week in going back every day. I spent hours in booths all across the city drinking more coffee than I ever have in my life. My theory was that he would be some bus boy or waiter that was quiet, but friendly.

Others visited soup kitchens, halfway houses, brothels, courts, and philosophy seminars, which seemed more insightful. The ones that truly puzzled me though were asking local fishermen at the docks if anyone had mysteriously quit recently. What were they thinking? That God had no imagination? It's improbable that He'd repeat the same approach. None of these theories resonated with me. I was thinking on a smaller scale. The past few weeks, I've been hanging out in cheap diners.

SK scanned ahead, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It always did with Halo, but her performance made up for the talking. Her body also helped, a trim model put out by a private engineer, its performance and shape tuned to perfection. A call came down the pipe for wet-work, and after checking the regular channels, he took it. Some slag over in the Red Light District had found himself on the wrong side of someone with power -- a death sentence ticking down to a hammer click and muzzle flash. Standard contract rules applied, so the job would get done, even if it took him several tries to do it right. `` The job, I get. It's the only way to make cash down here. But why go full droid when you did n't have to?'' She'd brought it up before, a pretext to talking about herself. If he were n't certain of her capabilities, the barrage of questions would make him wonder if she were afraid. Fear on the job got you killed, and SK planned on living a long, prosperous life. Coming down to this part of town meant dealing with the garish nature of a three-square mile mausoleum of vice. Neon and holos crawled across the exposed metallic flesh of every bar, whorehouse, and drug den. Each place belted out their specialties in hopes of starving out competition, even though good escorts would n't dare run down here. The verbal brawl and detached crowds made for perfect cover; no one wanted to find themselves on the wrong side of a barrel over a misunderstanding. `` We each have our reasons, let's leave it at that.'' Flexing a hand, SK let his aiming scripts run in the background while he brought building layouts and the target's info up on his visor. The guy was a low-level pusher, his main product a variant of speed put on the market after years of military use. It was good shit, the kind he'd use if he still had a body to feel the high. But that was the past. `` No, seriously, I want to know. Why'd you do it?'' Lowering her hood, Halo winced a smile, the chrome of her face curving as though it were flesh. It was crazy what engineering could accomplish these days, even if the distinction between meat and metal was clear as ice. The building was a old bar, shut down thanks to bad location and a few unfortunate brawls.", "text_ai_base": "\"Do you ever regret it?\" Halo asked. \"Is this really the time for that? We have a job to do,\" SK replied, scanning the area and bracing for what typically followed in conversations with Halo. Her performance usually justified her chatter, and her form\u2014a sleek design by a private engineer\u2014was optimized to perfection. A wet-work call had come through the usual channels, and SK accepted. Some poor guy in the Red Light District had crossed someone powerful, and his death seemed inevitable\u2014a mere trigger pull away. Following standard contract rules, SK would see the job through, even if it took multiple attempts to get it right. \"I understand the job; it's the only way to earn money here. But why go full droid when you didn't have to?\" Halo asked, circling back to a familiar topic, subtly shifting the focus to herself. If SK weren\u2019t confident in her skills, he'd suspect her questions hinted at fear\u2014a liability in their line of work. He had every intention of living a long, successful life, and in this neon-lit, vice-ridden part of town, survival meant understanding the risks. Glowing ads and projections blazed across every bar, brothel, and drug den, each establishment vying to outdo the others, though no good escort ventured here. The chaotic scene and scattered crowds provided excellent cover; nobody wanted to risk being mistakenly drawn into a dangerous confrontation. \"We each have our reasons; let's leave it at that.\" SK flexed his hand, letting his targeting software run silently while he studied building layouts and the target's information on his visor. The target was a low-ranking dealer, selling a speed variant adapted from military formulas. It was potent stuff\u2014the kind SK might have indulged in if he still had a body to experience it. But that was in the past. \"Seriously, why did you do it?\" Halo asked again. As she lowered her hood, her smile crinkled the chrome of her face as if it were real flesh.

The unmistakable feeling of humanity swirled around me in a phantasmagoria of flesh. The clutch of sweat and noise. Men and women waltzed around to electronic tones; swerving, pulsating, mutating bass flooded the room. Lights revealed sides of people that not even they knew, and in a second, it was gone. The room was tilted and spinning, like one of those mazes with the metal ball. *What was in this drink? * I looked deep into the red cup. *Or was it blue? * I could n't tell in the morphing carousel of movement. I swished it around for a second, to get a better idea of what exactly was in it. Surely this was what was warping my world in such a way. Come to think of it, the bunny-rabbit girl had given it to me. She grinned and handed me the drink. `` What's in it?'' `` Blood.'' `` Blood?'' I took a sip. It clearly was n't blood. `` Good one,'' I murmured, looking up for her as she sank into the pulsing crowd of people. And now, I was standing here alone. Hand against the wall, as it grew furry and enveloped my hand. The eyes of the partygoers started to glow a fierce green. They all had begun looking at me. Why? What had I done? I was just watching. Standing on the wall with my peculiar drink and watching. The music forced me deeper into the wall; the slurping low tones were gently pushing me forward. The partygoers had all stopped dancing. The churning lights still mutated their faces into grotesque phantasms of themselves. They had stopped moving. Hands at their sides, their ever-changing faces peered at me with dead, green eyes. The bass urged me deeper and deeper into the plush walls, as it came over my shoulder. I still held the curious drink in front of me, and as the wall sucked me further back into the embrace of what was concrete a few minutes ago, I felt an unmistakable calm. The wall came over my ears and the sleepy roll of the music sunk into me. My arm was still outstretched as to keep the empty faces of the other revelers at bay - `` Look, I've got a drink.'' It was warm inside the wall, and I let it take me. I took one last sip from the drink, my very last one, and the wall encompassed my head.

Occasionally it was more interesting than what was on TV, but most of the time it just led to empty bathrooms.

Another time he looked in the mirror to find someone who looked exactly like him. At first he thought his powers must have turned off, but then the other him moved his arm at a slightly different angle than he did. He mouthed to the other him `` can you see me'' only to find the other him was mouthing it along with him. They gathered a notepad and began to communicate. The conversation grew quite boring, as conversations with someone whom you can predict their every sentence tend to get. He discovered the other him's world was basically exactly the same. So they both decided to end the conversation, as the conversation was n't any better than thinking to oneself. Then one day something extra peculiar happened. When he looked in his bathroom mirror, all he saw was a complete black void. He checked the other mirror in his house. About half of them were void as well. He could n't do anything about it so he just went to work like normal. Fredrick was thankful he lived in a city with a lot of public transportation, due to his inability to use mirrors properly driving was extra dangerous. Once at work, he checked the mirrors there. About 3 fourths of them were void. He did n't bother putting much mental effort as to why this was happening. He figured it was just his special ability glitching out. During his coffee break he looked at the view outside. It was already dark. Not just dusk but middle of the night dark. He looked at his watch, it was only 3 pm. He looked around and found his coworkers seemed confused as well. They all gathered outside to look at the sky. It was completely dark, they could n't tell what was happening in the sky.

Fortunately, he quickly learned to rely on his phone's selfie camera to tidy himself up. One memorable incident involved him spotting an alien couple engaged in intimate activity through the mirror. Though he wasn't attracted to them, Fredrick saw it as a unique opportunity to indulge in interdimensional voyeurism. In another instance, he encountered a mirror reflection that looked exactly like him. Initially, he thought his ability had malfunctioned, but then he noticed the other him moving his arm differently. When he mouthed \"can you see me,\" the doppelg\u00e4nger mirrored his actions. They grabbed a notepad to communicate, but the conversation quickly became dull, as conversing with oneself tends to be. Realizing their worlds were nearly identical, they amicably ended the conversation. One day, something even stranger happened. Fredrick looked in his bathroom mirror and saw only a black void. Checking other mirrors in his house, he found about half of them similarly affected. Unable to do anything about it, he went to work as usual, thankful for the city's extensive public transportation; driving was riskier given his mirror issues. At work, about three-quarters of the mirrors also displayed voids, but he didn't dwell on it, assuming it was just a glitch in his power.

A few embarrassing moments, but he learned to just use his phone's selfie camera when grooming himself. Sometimes, though, he'd see a couple of aliens fuck, and while he had no attraction towards them, seeing an alien couple fuck was a good excuse for interdimensional voyeurism.

I watched the passing of a titan. Jared Arthur Shapiro, 1992-2098. The last man to die of old age. I was his friend, caretaker, and comforter. You see, I work professionally as a researcher at Dunham University studying old age. In this day and age it's hard to find subjects outside of textbooks, so I found Jared. He was a rebel. A man who recognized immortality for what it was, a nightmare. You see, while we in the world do not wrinkle and our cells do not decay, everything else associated with it does. Alzheimers and dementia still apply. I live in a world of amnesiacs. People whose memories have to be preserved on external drives, else they forget how to live. I myself am in need of a drive soon, says my doctor. I forgot who my wife was. Jared was the only one who recognized this hell. I say he was alone and sad, but it was a joyful kind of sadness, the kind that you get when you know your life is coming to an end and you gracefully accept it. You know you will be missed, and yet you know that when it comes, You will ride on the wings of an eagle to the light and the love. It is that gorgeous inner peace that will not be known again on this earth. We traded that simple peace for eternal beauty. That was the kind of wisdom Jared loved spouting. I knew him for the last 8 years of his life. He was in pretty bad shape when I went to interview him, because no one knew quite how to care for him anymore, it was a forgotten skill. The poor old man was falling apart at the seams. Unable to leave his house, organs starting to fail, no bowel control, Early stages of Alzheimers, He was a wreck. I cleaned him up and helped him through his final years. Because I, in my profession, knew how to care for him, I was his sole caretaker. Even as his mind and body failed him, he was happy. Jared took pleasure in the smallest, most unexpectedly beautiful things. Flowers, tiny bites of chocolate, porn videos ( which he though were marvelously funny. I remember we watched nine in a row together, hooting and hollering and throwing popcorn at the CompuScreen I gave him ), being wheeled through his garden, even breathing. He took pleasure in breathing! Nobody else I know in this ultra modern age even bothers considering how breathing is what keeps us alive.", "text_ai_base": "Jared Arthur Shapiro: a titan of his time. From 1992-2098, he lived as a remarkable figure, the last man to die of old age. I had the privilege of being his friend, caretaker, and confidant. As a researcher at Dunham University focused on aging, subjects like Jared are rare, sourced more from textbooks than flesh and blood. His stance against immortality was unique; he viewed eternal life as a nightmare rather than a blessing. In our modern world, where our bodies no longer wrinkle and cells don\u2019t decay, the mind still suffers. Alzheimer's and dementia are relentless, turning our lives into those of amnesiacs reliant on external memory drives. My own doctor warns that I will need one soon\u2014I've already forgotten who my wife is. Jared, a rebel of his time, understood this predicament. Though I describe him as sad and alone, it was a profound, peaceful sadness. He met his life's end with graceful acceptance, cherishing the knowledge that he would be missed. In his serenity, he found joy, envisioning his departure as a journey on eagle wings towards light and love\u2014a peace we traded for eternal youth and beauty. Jared prized this wisdom and shared it often during the last eight years I spent with him. When I first met Jared for an interview, he was in dire condition, a victim of forgotten caregiving skills. His body was failing\u2014organs weakening, memory fading, confined to his home. Being the sole caretaker, I assisted him in his final years, drawing upon my expertise to ease his frailty. Despite his declining health, Jared was remarkably content. He found delight in small, beautiful moments: flowers, tiny bites of chocolate, and even the humor of porn videos\u2014which made him laugh riotously as we watched together, tossing popcorn at the CompuScreen.

I'd walk around a corner, or reach for something under the ottoman. And there she was. My cat. She would leap at my face. It seemed like fairly normal cat behavior, except that she would do it constantly, in multiple parts of my body. Almost like she was testing my reflexes....figuring out where I was weak. Recently, I had seen her walking through the house, analyzing everything. She always seemed to spend extra time near the knives I keep in the cabinet, and examined all the power tools in the garage.

Sometimes there would be books laid out by them... often gruesome, deathly books that depicted horrific executions and torture. It was getting very bad. I'd be taking a shower and when I came out....there she was. Sitting on the counter, just watching me. A completely straight face, unblinking. Yet something always seemed.....sinister... about those eyes. Then the killing started. Oh, the killing. Dead birds -- -then came the dead raccoons, and otters, and soon enough a fox then a wolf....what kind of cat kills a fox? I was worried, so I thought about bringing my cat to the vet. Like they could do anything. Little did I know it, but she was beyond help then. I was n't, but I did n't know that yet either. She always resisted the visits to the vet though.

Made me travel for fucking days when I was ready to pop and you could n't even take me to a damn doctor when I started going into labor!'' The argument halted as the unhappy couple's attention turned to their new baby, whose cries at being awoken had finally grown louder than the both of them. Joe rubbed his temples, sighing. The new mother rose and rocked her child gently for a few minutes, placing him back down when his crying had abated. She turned back to her husband, who continued in a whisper, `` Please? We can use the massage oil we got at the baby shower.'' `` Alright, alright, fine. Let's do this. *Quietly*.''

Although time and age does not suffice in explaining my age, a simple and blunt adjective is `` old''. I am old, around twenty centuries old to be exact but I have retained my twenty five year old youthful physique since the day I was cursed with immortality. Because of this, I let her path be guided by her parents and I allow time to let her develop some individuality. I never intervene while she matures, that is not my place. I have been reluctant to fall into love since I gained immortality. Other than giving into my physical desires, relationship building was never something I sought after. That all I changed when I met her, the woman who shattered this notion that I, the man who never can die, was not worthy of love. Now, I spend my days searching for her after her rebirth from death. It has been twenty five years since she left my arms and now, she is a woman again in a different century and I can not wait to see her.

My heart races and the familiar feeling in the air thickens when I start to walk in her direction. She looks down from the sky and our eyes lock together.

At least it would have been if I was not already working at the same company but in another department. Confusing? Let me explain: I was hired at Coca-Cola more than 10 years ago. In a few years I was a middle manager in charge of online presence. 10 years ago the internet was very different, and when social media appeared I was one of the first in the company to realise it's potential. This catapulted me in the higher circles where I met some pretty influencial people. In just a few years I was one of the youngest bosses there. That's when my life took a turn for the weird. I remember the conversation with the CEO like it was yesterday: - So John, I have a weird proposition for you. I confide in you because I am certain of your loyalty and I know you are motivated not by position or money, but by being challenged every day. So this is what I want you to do ( At this point I was fairly certain that I was either fired or received a promotion. Nothing could have prepared me for what came next ) - I want to to get a job at Pepsi Co. And then to spy on them to me. You will get an enourmous sum of money from us where you can fuel your drug habit. I looked at him with a blank stare, I thought I had hidden my drug problems quite well. Apparantely I did not. Anyway, that was a few years ago. I applied to Pepsi and presented myself at the interview as a disgrunted employee that wants to jump ship. As I was relative known in the industry and I knew lots of things about Coca-Cola I was quickly hired. I would give them honest insight as best I knew and I also made friends with the people I worked. It was not hard as I always managed to make friends. Every weekend I would meet a guy at a fast food joint and we would discuss what I have learned that week. So during the years I would slowly climb ranks inside the company, gaining some promotions along the way, and at the same time getting a lot more money from cocacola for information. Soon I was able to get vital information about strategy and vision from the VPs and high placed managers there. This quite good life ended a few months ago when I was called in the office of one of many VPs there, a guy named Clint.", "text_ai_base": "Seeing your name on the office door is always a wonderful moment, or at least it would have been if I hadn't already worked at the company, albeit in a different department. Confused? Let me clarify: I was hired by Coca-Cola more than a decade ago, and within a few years, I'd become a middle manager responsible for the company's online presence. Ten years ago, the internet was a vastly different place, and when social media emerged, I was among the first at Coca-Cola to recognize its potential. This propelled me into the higher echelons of the company, where I crossed paths with some influential individuals. Within a few years, I had become one of the youngest executives there, and that's when my journey took an unexpected turn. I vividly recall the conversation with the CEO: \"John, I have a rather unusual proposal for you,\" he said. \"I trust you because I know your loyalty isn't driven by position or money but by the desire to face new challenges daily. Here's what I'd like you to do.\" At this point, I was convinced I was either being fired or promoted, but nothing could have prepared me for the actual request. \"I want you to secure a job at PepsiCo and act as an informant for us. You'll receive a substantial sum from us to support your drug habit.\" I stared at him blankly, stunned that my drug issues were not as concealed as I thought. This was a few years back. I applied to PepsiCo, framing myself as a dissatisfied employee looking to leave Coca-Cola. As I was relatively well-known in the industry and knowledgeable about Coca-Cola\u2019s operations, I was quickly hired. I offered honest insights and easily made friends with my new colleagues, which wasn\u2019t difficult for me. Each weekend, I'd meet a contact at a fast-food restaurant to discuss my findings from the week. Over time, I gradually ascended the ranks at PepsiCo, earning promotions alongside substantial payments from Coca-Cola for my intelligence gathering.

The little letter selector was replaced by a handful of numbers. The shipping label had something in the note section.'We need to talk.' I was a fair bit shocked. Some of the child's fear returned, but the adult mind suppressed it. The thought went that anything that wanted to talk probably did n't mean harm.

At first, it was simply an absence - a squirrel who I'd always seen outside my window, a dear pet, a beloved but distant grandfather. Those early lessons, no different from anyone else's, left no great impression on my young mind. But as I grew, and aged, they became more insistent. Far-away tragedies - wars, natural disasters - seemed to occur at critical moments to pull me out of my self-absorption. Those close to me came and went. My parents passed, and I was thrust into responsibility for my own life. Friends - good and bad influences alike - came to unfortunate ends before I could be pulled onto their paths and away from that determined for me long ago. None of those losses hurt as much as her. She gave my life meaning it had never had. In the time I had with her - all too brief - nothing else mattered. Her suffering was the hardest lesson of all. I cursed God who I mistakenly blamed for taking her from me, science that could not save her, other people and forces for no better reasons. Of course I blamed myself as well. The years that followed were dark and lonesome. And finally death - not the dark, ominous concept, but the being itself - stood before me. For the first time, I looked into his eyes. I saw his relief - almost an innocence, like I'd had before he first made his power known to me. Happiness to be rid of his burden, too - an overwhelming joy I'd not felt since before he'd stolen my love from me. He may no longer hold the power he'd given me, but the wisdom of eons remained. He could see my thoughts - my anger as I thought back to all that he had taken from me, all he had put me through. And I saw his fear, a familiar sensation from when I felt that my own death was close. But I also thought back on all he'd taught me. The old man cowered before me.

I mean, what else would it be? It was fitted with a series of solar panels to keep it powered and since it certainly would n't be receiving any upkeep, we built it to last. You see, that's one thing we're damn good at, making things last. And the only reason the LES1 ceased transmission was because a fault in it's launch put it in an imperfect orbit, so honestly, had we know a bit more about which way it went, we could have told you that it could come back. That's not what surprised us. No, not the... It was n't the return, it's what came with it that surprised us. Again, when we got those signals, there were laughs and high fives and it was all just a good time, but then one of our guys, a radio astronomer, decided to look into the signals. I remember when he came into my office. He had a look on his face, the kind you get when you know you have to spill the beans on something but you're scared of what'll happen to you if you do. He came to me, sat in the chair across from my desk and stared at the floor in front of him. Let me tell you, that lunatic sat in cold silence for a solid ten minutes, breathing real slow while I typed away at my computer waiting for him to gather his nerve against whatever had him so on edge. I knew his dad from back in high school and the kid was bright but always a bit of a nut, so I just let him be while I answered some e-mails, figured it was n't any big deal to me. But after a bit, I broke the ice for him. I said something like `` I've been hearing some funny things about that LES1.'' He seemed to tense up a bit but I kept pushing. `` A couple guys down in astronautical ran the numbers on the thing's movement based on the paths of all other bodies it would have come across. Apparently, they are n't able to track it back to even approximately were we lost it.''

The LES1 stopped transmitting due to a launch error causing an unstable orbit, so if we'd had more information about its trajectory, we might have predicted its return. That wasn't the surprising part, though. The unexpected element was what accompanied the return. Initially, the signals were met with laughs and high fives, just a fun moment, but then a radio astronomer among us decided to analyze them further. I recall when he entered my office, looking like he\u2019d uncovered something unsettling. His expression was tense, as if he was anxious about sharing news that might expose him to consequences. He sat across from me and stared at the floor, silent for ten long minutes, breathing slowly while I continued typing at my computer, giving him time to muster the courage to speak. I'd known his father from high school and always regarded him as bright but quirky. So, I waited patiently. Eventually, I broke the ice, saying, \"I've heard some intriguing things about that LES1.\" He seemed to tense, but I continued, \"A few guys in the astronautics department ran some calculations on its trajectory considering all other celestial bodies it might have encountered.

She looked like trouble of the best kind. \u201cOlivia,\u201d I whispered her name and struggled to get the next part out, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but I can\u2019t.\u201d I turned to leave but she grabbed my arm. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d she asked, and I realized my mistake. \u201cJust please let me go,\u201d I responded and turned to look at her. Her eyes were the most beautiful shade of blue I have ever seen, so deep, so pained\u2026 \u201cCome on, I just want some company,\u201d she responded and let go of me, her features visibly softening. \u201cI\u2019m feeling down.\u201d \u201cPlus,\u201d she grinned, \u201cyou are cute.\u201d I glanced at her and then over my shoulder back at the school.

If you have any questions, forget about them, because this is a guided tour and your questions wo n't make any sense. Yes, I meant that, I'm not being funny. We are standing currently at the entrance of this individual's mind. As many of you can already tell, it's a male, well done on you. For those interested, you will see the overall picture from here, he does *not* think about sexual intercourse every seven seconds. He thinks about it every so often. Over to the left, you have Friendship Valley. Why is it a valley? What did I say about questions? Anyways, you can see from here that it has high walls, protected on a constant basis and it is *not* a prison. It's a uptopia for all the thoughts of the mind reserved for his closest friends. As we continue, directly ahead of us is the main thinking cortex. It's powerful, but it's not clever. Intelligence is relative ma'am, just like your face. Some may think you beautiful, but people are allowed to be *wrong*. You will notice that the storage area is large and has already been divided into several important sections. Notice that *Adventure Time* is becoming a permanent part of this storage and is currently under construction. Coming up on our left, you will see the Spite and Anger, Fear and Distrust part of the individual's mind. Of course it's large, have you seen what's on the internet? Makes your blood boil. It's storage unit for images and videos is fairly small, but we all make mistakes by focusing on one specific moment, do n't we all? Question? Well, I do n't have an answer. Onto the next portion! Here we have the creativity filter and thought process creation. It look complex, but if you look at the diagram, then you'll discover it's rather simple. No ma'am, again, no questions. Nor do I have the time or crayons to describe this for you. One of the things that is currently on this individual's mind is writing out stories, specifically on a typewriter. But since he does n't want to appear hipster, he's going for a pretentious gamer look with a mechanical keyboard, colored like a toy. An interesting exhibit indeed. Oh! And look! You can see the latest thing this individual is working on! It's a short story about describing the inner parts of your mind. Who knows? Maybe he took the prompt a little bit too literally, but I think we can all imagine that it's bound to fail. Next! The last exhibit.", "text_ai_base": "Hello everyone! Thank you all for joining us, and please make sure to stay inside the white line as we proceed with our tour. While we appreciate curiosity, please hold your questions, as this is a guided experience where they won't apply. I'm not joking; I really mean it. We are currently standing at the entrance of this person's mind. As many of you might have guessed, this mind belongs to a male, so kudos to you. Now, for those interested, you'll notice that despite common myths, he does *not* think about sexual matters every seven seconds. Instead, he thinks about them occasionally. To our left is Friendship Valley. Why is it called a valley? Remember what I said about questions? In any case, you can see that it boasts high protective walls, though it's not a prison. It's actually an utopia for the thoughts reserved for his closest friends. Moving ahead, we have what is known as the main thinking cortex. It's powerful but not necessarily clever. Remember that intelligence is subjective, ma'am, much like beauty\u2014a matter of opinion, allowing room for error. You'll see that the storage area is extensive and organized into key sections. Note that *Adventure Time* is becoming a permanent fixture here and is currently under development. To our left, we have the sections dealing with Spite and Anger, Fear and Distrust. Obviously, it\u2019s substantial; just consider the online world\u2014truly infuriating. Its storage for images and videos is somewhat limited, but don't we all occasionally fixate too much on singular moments? Questions? Sorry, I have no answers. Let's move on! Here is the creativity filter and thought creation area. It may seem intricate, but upon reviewing the diagram, you'll find it straightforward. No questions, ma'am, and unfortunately, I lack both the time and crayons to explain further. Something currently occupying this individual's mind is story writing, particularly using a typewriter. Though he's avoiding the hipster label, opting instead for a pretentious gamer aesthetic with a toy-colored mechanical keyboard. Quite an intriguing display, indeed! Oh, and look! The latest endeavor\u2014a short story exploring the mind's inner workings\u2014is right here.

As I left the office, I debated crapping before I left, but decided I'd much rather do the deed on my home turf. I sat in traffic for what felt like hours. The pressure built to an almost unbearable level. When I finally got home, I bolted from my car like an olympic sprinter. I parked on the curb and sprinted across the lawn. If I had not been so focused on evacuating my bowels, I might have noticed that an unfamiliar van was parked in my driveway or that the door was slightly ajar or that several of my most precious possessions were gone. But I did not. As I rushed into that bathroom and dropped my pants, all I could think about was sweet, sweet release. I am not in the habit of documenting my bowel movements, but if I were keeping a list of my top ten all time greatest shits, this one would have easily topped it. The feeling was literally orgasmic. I had never passed anything like this before. I moaned with pleasure, howled in agony, and wept in awe at the new and incredible sensations I was feeling. after I finished, I knew in my heart that I would n't even have to wipe. In a stupor, I stumbled to the kitchen, popped a bottle of champagne and opened a box of Triscuit\u00ae crackers to celebrate the life-changing shit that had just gone down. Just then, I heard a faint thud coming from my bathroom. Probably just the house settling, but it made me realize that I had forgotten to flush in my post-bowel movement ecstasy. As I walked towards the bathroom to flush, I heard another thud. This time I realized I was hearing footsteps.

Had I not been so fixated on relieving myself, I might have noticed the unfamiliar van in my driveway, the slightly open door, or the disappearance of some of my treasured possessions. But my mind was singularly focused on the urgent need for release. As I rushed into the bathroom and dropped my pants, my thoughts were consumed by the prospect of relief. Though I don\u2019t typically record my bathroom experiences, this one would undoubtedly claim the top spot among my most memorable. The sensation was akin to euphoria, an unprecedented experience that left me moaning in satisfaction, crying out in pain, and weeping in awe at the new and incredible sensations coursing through me. Afterward, I instinctively felt that wiping wouldn't be necessary.

Villain escapes jail, villain calls out hero, hero falls in trap, villain monologues about plan, hero breaks out of trap, hero defeats villain, villain goes to jail, circle starts over. Yet here I stand, the bloodied and lifeless corpse of my greatest arch-enemy lying in my arms. The day started like any other. I'd just made my greatest escape ever. Using suction pads and various elements of stealth, I was able to make it to the entrance of the prison, by clopping along on the ceiling. There were one or two mistakes that almost made me fall face first in front of a guard station, but for the most part it went pretty smoothly. After that, it was just a matter of slipping under the nearest bus, and I was home free. There was quite a bit of dust on the computers in my lair. It had been almost a year since I'd been put into the prison, and not everyone has a butler that some goody-two-shoes hero can have. I booted up the machine, and looked through the files. Use a tractor beam to move the moon? Did that last time. Shark tank? Not at todays shark prices. Labyrinth? Too old fashioned. I turned off the computer and just decided to do a simple kidnapping. After all, what could go wrong? The trap had been set. The hero alerted. The woman dangled from a rope high above the factory floor, where a simple little setup of circular saws awaited her body. It was simple enough. He would burst in, I would shoot the rope, she would fall, he would leap over and save her, inches away from the saws, in the meantime, sending me over the edge just above the saws with this convenient rope trap I set up below my feet. On cue, the hero appeared. Shot fired, hero saved girl, villain dangling from ceiling. The perfect ending. Except for what happened next. He gloated. The hero does n't gloat! Something's wrong here! He raised his spear, and uttered a death threat. Kill me? But what about our back and forth? The game is n't a game when someone refuses to play by the rules. The hero thrust forward, as I pulled myself upwards on the rope, the spear missing, but the hero falling off balance and falling into the deathtrap below. I'd won, right?

So I settled on a simple kidnapping\u2014what could possibly go wrong? The trap was laid, the hero notified. A woman dangled high above the factory floor, where circular saws awaited her.

He could n't believe the junior detective's report. The dude looked like a burnt out hippie who would n't harm a butterfly. The video he was watching was mesmerizing him, practically putting him to sleep. He continued to glance through the report, looking at crime scene photos with `` The Joy of Painting'' playing in the background. He flipped through half a dozen different crime scene photos before he got to one that looked strangely familiar. `` Highbury road. Highbury road. Highbury road.'' There were no exterior shots of the road, so he went to google maps, and was unnerved to find it adjacent to a beautiful mountain range that overlooked one of the clearest and calmest lakes on the county. He could be onto something. His brain told him it could n't be, but his heart was dropping. If this crime scene had been painted by Bob Ross, it was a link. He had run successful investigations on similar hunches before. He walked into the lieutenants office to ask for money to buy the Bob Ross `` The Joy of Painting'' full collection to investigate more when he froze. `` Can I help you sir?'' Bobby was silent. `` HELLO!'' The lieutenants yell woke him from his gaze. `` Lieutenant, I think the junior detective may have been onto something.'' Bobby held the scenic photo of the location he had just printed, with a spot circled for the location of the crime scene. Behind the lieutenants head was a Bob Ross painting, somehow identical to the scene he had printed out. The only difference was a hanging tree, with beautiful yellow fall leaves, except for one red one, in the identical spot he had circled to mark the crime scene. `` OFFICER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY OFFICE?'' The lieutenant was not a patient man. `` Sir, I think this detective may be on to something,'' Bobby said in a scared, whimpering tone, his mouth still hanging ajar. `` There's just too much evidence in this file to be a coincidence.

The lazy summer sunlight burned his retinas and he quickly closed them while stretching and letting out a yawn. He did not have much reason to wake up these days.

The diner just like the customers that kept it open; worn out, frayed, but full of memories. As he entered the door, the cook and two patrons stopped arguing baseball and looked towards the door. `` Frank!'' the cook shouted, `` It's been so long, I thought you moved. I'll have your food right up!'' and with that the cook disappeared in the back before Frank could say anything. Frank slumped in his usual booth over looking the street. As he sat, he interrupted a layer of dust particles, and they angerly floated away to a new resting spot. After a few minutes of car watching, the cook laid two plates down on the table. Frank was n't able to explain his wife would n't be joining him anymore. `` Enjoy! I gave the lady a little less mayo, just the way she likes it!'' and before Frank could retaliate, another regular appeared and the cook jetted off to greet him. Frank stared at the accidental sandwich and wondered what he would do with it. He did not have to wonder long as a young boy plopped on the booth across from him, disturbing the freshly settled dust. `` How's it going mister!'' eagerly stated the boy. `` Uh, erm, what can I do for you boy'' stuttered Frank. This was the first time he had talked in months. `` My dog ran away and I've spent all day looking for him.

The first thing I did was gasp for air, which was something I'd never thought I'd do again when I felt the life leaving my body. It the most unique breath I'd ever taken though, I did n't remember breathing feeling quite like this, and it took me a few more moments of hard panting to figure out why. I did n't need to breath, my entire body felt odd and unnatural, I was dead. I knew I was dead, I could feel the lifelessness of my body. I was n't sure why I had a body. My face was pressed against a stone floor. I kept breathing out of habit, although the knowledge I did n't need to made the whole operation pretty uncomfortable. I opened my eyes.

My brain did n't really start processing this whole situation until I tilted my head up to see who was wearing the shoes. It was me. It was simply unmistakably me, sitting on a stool, looking down on me. The other Me was wearing a fitted suit that matched the black shoes. He was looking at me incredulously. I flipped myself onto my back and then propped myself up on my elbows and looked back. Other Me had slightly longer hair than me. He looked in his late 20s to early 30s, the same age as me. He seemed a little healthier. He was still looking at me with deep confusion, a gaze I realized I was probably reciprocating. I decided to speak up. `` So, I think I'm in hell. I'm not sure who you are or what you're doing here though.'' He sustained his stare but responded, `` Okay... okay.'' He swallowed, his face was that of a man trying to grasp a situation he'd never prepared for, but he kept his cool, ``... so, hell. So you're dead.'' I nodded, `` I for sure am, last thing I remember before this was getting stabbed by a guy.'' `` Why'd he stab you?'' `` I owed him some money. He was a drug dealer.'' I did n't see any point in lying to myself.

My face rested against a stone floor, and I continued to breathe out of habit, even though knowing I didn\u2019t need to made it uncomfortable.

He nocked an arrow at me, pity in his eyes, and let it fly. I spent a year, grasping at weapons that refused my touch. I worked the plague arrow all the way through my heart. I did not die. I waited hundreds of years, but no more children came to claim weapons from the hall. Men are not solitary beasts. I did what I could, and I resisted for thousands of years... but the voice of the ivory horse is sweet. In short, it drove me mad.

Tears me to shreads inside. You'd think by now I'd be use to it, would have built up some type of tolerance or indifference to it. nope. `` What are you doing in here?

My heart beats dangerously at my chest in panic. Then it happened. My dad's eyes caught a glimpse of his death, and then he was... I do n't know how to describe it. It was elegant, like he was dancing. But it was beautiful, almost ethereal. He danced around and between the knives like time was insignificant to him.

We were like two peas in a pod, we went everywhere and did everything together, this birthday party was no exception. `` Yes.'' I replied, `` I'm really looking forward to my cake. My Aunt made it. It's her special triple chocolate layer cake.'' Sam's eyes widened and eyebrows raised just a bit. `` Oh, sweet! Your Aunt makes the best cakes. Her bakery is the talk of the town.'' I could tell Sam was excited. Sam also loved chocolate cake, just like me. As we walked down the sidewalk towards the party, the cool fall wind brushed against my arms. I was only wearing a T-shirt. I guess my mom was right, maybe I should have wore a jacket when I left for school this morning. `` So...'' said Sam, then after a short pause hesitantly and nervously continued, `` How do you think you did on Ms. Mori's math test today?'' Ms. Mori was our 7th grade math teacher. She was nice and pretty smart, but her exams were n't exactly a cake walk. I could tell Sam did n't think the test today was easy. `` Eh, alright.'' I replied. `` I think'x' equaled 12, and 12 - 12 is 0. So, I think the final answer was zero.'' Sam kinda just stared forward, `` Oh, I guess I just could n't make the connection.'' Sam replied, mind drifting. I guess he was thinking about something else. But that's when it happened, and it happened so fast. At that moment we were no longer on the side walk, but rather in the middle of the cross walk and crossing the street. There was a red car, going three times faster then it should have been going on this quiet suburban street. Sam's mind was still drifting. He did n't see it coming. I pushed Sam forward, out of the crosswalk and onto the sidewalk. No car was getting my best friend today. At least not while I was alive and kicking. Slowly, Sam's screaming faded into silence, and as the doctor slapped my ass, a new screaming filled the room. I could see my mother's smile.

My Aunt made it\u2014her special triple chocolate layer cake.\" Sam\u2019s eyes widened and his eyebrows shot up slightly. \"Oh, sweet! Your Aunt bakes the best cakes. Her bakery is famous around town.\" Sam\u2019s enthusiasm was clear; he loved chocolate cake as much as I did. As we walked towards the party, a cool fall breeze brushed against my arms. I regretted not wearing a jacket, though Mom had advised me to wear one before leaving for school. \"So\u2026\" Sam began, then after a brief pause continued hesitantly, \"How do you think you did on Ms. Mori\u2019s math test today?\" Ms. Mori was our seventh-grade math teacher, kind and smart, but her tests weren't easy. Sam seemed uncertain about how he did. \"Alright,\" I said, \"I figured 'x' was 12, and 12 minus 12 is zero. So, I think the answer was zero.\" Sam stared ahead, \"Oh, I didn\u2019t make that connection,\" he admitted, his thoughts elsewhere. But suddenly, things changed. While crossing the street in the crosswalk, a red car sped towards us, far faster than it should have moved down our quiet suburban street. Sam was distracted and didn\u2019t notice it. I quickly shoved him forward, out of harm's way onto the sidewalk. No car was going to take my best friend today\u2014not while I was around. As Sam\u2019s shouting faded, another cry filled the air: the doctor\u2019s slap echoing off a newborn as my mother beamed with pride. Her face glowed like any new mother\u2019s would. And I was back at the start, reincarnated into my 12-year-old self.

A crisp breeze tumbled through the open air, whipping its cold hands at my exposed arms.

Maybe we should poke it with something. Like a stick or something and see what happens? \u201d \u201c Ok! \u201d Marlow began looking for a stick or something to poke it with. As he was searching, Brian continued to stare at the strange point in space. It wasn \u2019 t moving, but it seemed to have something inside of it moving. Brian was afraid to get too close to this particular point in space, for fear that it would electrocute him. Brian was paranoid of being electrocuted. \u201c I got a stick. Here! Poke it! \u201d Marlow said. \u201c Why me? You have the stick, you poke it. \u201d \u201c Jesus, Brian, what the hell are you afraid of? It \u2019 s just a particular point in space. It doesn \u2019 t even seem to be moving. Poke it and see if it moves! What are you scared of? \u201d Brian remembered the last time someone had goaded him into poking something. It was years ago, when he was much younger. His schoolmates teased him, and called him all sorts of names, until he crumbled under the peer pressure, and went ahead with the poking. Since then, Brian had a subtle phobia of light sockets. He still has nightmares about light switches, electrical cords, and high tension wires. \u201c Listen buddy! There \u2019 s no way in hell I \u2019 m going to poke this thing. If you want to see what happens when you poke it, then YOU poke it. In fact, I think you \u2019 re a coward if you don \u2019 t poke it! \u201d Brian thought about this statement, and deep in the back of his mind, he felt guilty for calling his friend names for not poking something. Brian looked at Marlow and apologized. \u201c I \u2019 m sorry. You \u2019 re not a coward. Maybe we could throw something at it instead? \u201d Marlow laughed, and plunged the stick forward into the strange, peculiar, particular, point in space. A small flicker of light, a loud pop, and an arc of electricity zapped Marlow through the branch. Brian and Marlow smelled burnt arm hair. \u201c It electrocuted me! \u201d shouted Marlow, \u201c Man, that hurt! But like\u2026 what a rush, ya know? Scary, but it almost felt good! You want to try? \u201d Marlow offered the stick to Brian. Brian shook his head. \u201c OK then, I \u2019 m going to poke it again! \u201d Marlow reached in for the second time, and again was zapped by this particular point in space. \u201c WOW!", "text_ai_base": "\"Did you touch it?\" \"Of course not! Did you?\" \"Definitely not. Maybe we should poke it with something, like a stick, to see what happens.\" \"Okay!\" Marlow began scanning the area for a suitable stick. Meanwhile, Brian kept his gaze fixed on the strange point in space. It wasn't moving, yet something seemed to stir within it. Worried about getting too close, Brian feared it might electrocute him. He harbored a deep fear of electric shocks. \"I found a stick. Here! You poke it!\" Marlow said. \u201cWhy should I? You have the stick, so you poke it.\u201d \"Come on, Brian, what are you so scared of? It\u2019s just a point in space. It doesn't even move. Just poke it and see! What are you afraid of?\" Marlow insisted. Brian recalled the last time someone pushed him into poking something. It was years ago when he was younger. His classmates had teased him relentlessly until he caved under the pressure. Ever since, he'd developed a subtle fear of electrical outlets. Even now, he dreams about light switches and power cords. \"Listen, there's no way I'm poking that thing. If you want to do it, then go ahead. And I think you're chicken if you don\u2019t!\" Brian reflected on his harsh words and felt a pang of guilt. He turned to Marlow, apologizing. \"I'm sorry. You're not a coward. Maybe we could throw something at it instead?\" Marlow chuckled and thrust the stick toward the peculiar spot. At once, there was a small flash, a loud pop, and a jolt of electricity ran through Marlow via the branch. The air filled with the smell of burnt hair. \"It shocked me!\" Marlow yelled, \"Wow, that hurt! But, strangely, it felt kind of exciting. Want to try?\" He offered the stick to Brian, who shook his head. \"Alright then, I'm going for round two!\" Marlow reached in again and was zapped by the mysterious point in space once more. \"WOW!\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Did you touch it? Hell no! Did you? Hell no. Should we like, poke it with a stick or something to see what it does? Yea! Marlow began looking around for a stick somewhere.

It could short me out! Brian hated being shocked. Hey, I found a stick. Here! You poke it! Why do I have to? You have the stick, you poke it. Oh come on Brian, what are you so afraid of, you chicken? It\u2019s a point in space for god\u2019s sake. It doesn\u2019t move or anything. Just poke it and see what if does! What\u2019s wrong with you? Just poke it! Marlow pleaded. Brian remembered the last time he got pressured into poking something. It was at a much younger age, but all the kids in class called him chicken and he eventually gave in to the peer pressure. He\u2019s never been the same since, and even to this day has a slight phobia of electrical outlets. He dreams of light switches to this day. Listen, there aint no way in hell I\u2019m poking that thing unless you wanna poke it. But I honestly think that you\u2019re even more of a chicken than me! Brian realized he just spoke ill against his host as a house-guest, and quickly felt remorse. Listen I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re no chicken. Can\u2019t we just throw something at it?

From it emerged what also seemed very much like a human male bearing a box. The creature strode up to the door and rang its bell. The door opened and inside was yet another human male. The view switched to that from inside the house, looking towards the open door. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' Someone order a pizza?'' asked the man holding the box. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' A pizza?'' repeated the captain, incredulous.

Inside was another human male, and the view switched to show the interior perspective. \"Did someone order a pizza?\" asked the man holding the box. \"A pizza?\" the captain repeated incredulously, turning to his second-in-command with a look of annoyance. \"Please, sir,\" urged the android, gesturing towards the screen. \"You're about to see the discrepancy.\" The captain turned back just in time to witness the two men embracing and kissing, with the pizza now absent. Feltch was captivated by the scene. \"Android 18, is it that week on this planet?\" he asked as the men quickly began undressing in a frenzy. \"Surprisingly, no, Captain,\" replied the android. \"Such carnal displays are common here and not limited by mating cycles.

We just wait outside. Muscle to be flexed when the time arises. We never see one another outside of our gear, and rarely speak unless we need to. We are all numbers. I am Fifty. It is all business as usual. Our gear is top of the line, S-343 power suits with a full array of monitoring addons. It enhances and supports our bodies increasing reaction time as well as proportionately increasing our strength. Makes taking a piss a dangerous activity. Our primary weapon is a Phase 3 PulseRifle with enough battery to take down a small country. Our sidearm is a S22 ballistic pistol, along with 3 concussion grenades and a single EMP. The helmet is a fully self sustained life support system with all the bells and whistles to let its user live in the harshest environments for up to 72 hours. It is still cold, I never did enjoy the bitter cold of science. All provided and maintained by IMS, a bit much for a wallflower job if you ask me. I would have been happy with my leathers and a plain old 12ga shotgun. The pay is good and I am not the one to ask questions. November 19, 2067 I have n't seen FourtyNine in a few days, been flying solo. Guess the brass at IMS figured watching the dirt is a job one man can handle. Normal movement into and out of the bunker. A pretty young scientist whose name tag identified her as Dr.Heller has joined the team. Despite the large age gap she seems to have more control than the rest of the faceless lab coats I see. I got a call from my handler today, Lydia took her first steps today. I wish I could be there. December 13, 2067 Almost a month has passed since anything has changed.

I opened the door and stepped out into the rain, into the darkness, where the only light for miles in any direction were my headlights. Our town was a small town with a size of around five thousand people. Here, you'd suspect that everyone would know everyone else, but even our community had its `` cliques,'' our own circles of friends. Sure, people would recognize and greet each other as we passed by, but talk to each other? Not really. So when someone struggles silently, they struggle here just as they would anywhere -- nobody cares. It was half past midnight, so the fields outside our town were dark, and everyone inside our town were asleep, all their lights shut off.

Even in the dark, I could tell it was a new bottle. `` Mister, can you just... can you just step back over here and we can talk about it?'' I spoke softly, making sure to not startle him again, as I quietly approached him from behind. He did n't bother turning around. `` No, I'm fine right here.'' His voice was cold, steady, and certain of what he was going to do. I knew I had to choose my words wisely. `` Mind if I sit with you?'' He shook his head. I kicked off my heals and looked over the bridge. Vertigo immediately overtook me, but I closed my eyes and breathed deeply before taking a seat beside him. `` So, um, what are you doing here?'' I asked again. He did n't reply. We sat there silently, listening to the rain splatter on the ground behind us. Moments turned to minutes, and minutes felt like hours, just sitting on the edge of death, together. `` Knock knock.'' A confused look washed over his face, which was better than the stoicity it had for the past hour. ``... what?'' he asked, turning to face me. `` Knock knock,'' I repeated. I could feel him looking at my face for what seemed like eternity, before he replied, `` Who's there?'' `` Orange.'' The corner of his lip turned up. `` Orange who?''

He didn't bother turning around. \"No, I'm fine right here,\" he responded, his voice cold and resolute. Knowing I had to tread carefully, I asked, \"Mind if I sit with you?\" He shook his head.

He studied my face for what seemed like ages before responding, \"Who's there?\" \"Orange.\" A hint of a smile appeared at the corner of his lips. \"Orange who?\" I turned to him, grinning. \"Orange you glad I'm here?\" I said, playfully poking his nose like a button.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Hold on a sec; just a moment.

Your cousin, my friend, always said it, but she could not have described the way your curly brown hair falls in front of your radiant eyes. I am fifth in line for the Nigerian throne, and I wish to see you someday. I have started to make a trust fund so that i can visit you someday, and if you could donate to it ( even just a little ) it would help my dream become glorious reality. Love, Achike Abasad, Prince of Nigeria I was furious when I received the email. I had just posted a picture on my Facebook page of my cousin and I together at a beach in California. This `` Prince'', this scammer, had clearly been looking through my personal page and tried to use my cousin against me, staining my memory of the beautiful California sun on my back. Had he *really* thought that I would n't ask my cousin before I gave him *any* money? So though my better judgement advised against extending the interaction, I sent him an angry email in return. He responded. Ms. Lianne, You have discovered me. I am a poor scammer working out of a crumbling office in Nigeria, and the only way I could contact you was through a scam. However, my feelings towards you, my longing to meet you, were all too real. You are a symbol of the love I have never gotten, the luxury I have been denied. Please let me video message you during work. It is strictly forbidden, but it is the only way I can think of to convince you of my good intentions. Love, Achike Abasad, Email Scammer Before I continue, I should tell you that I am an exquisitely lonely person. I inherited my wealth. I fill my time ordering from the pages of Skymall and ladies' magazines. To find interest in me outside of my money or familial connections was intriguing, and the invitation was too good to ignore. I turned on the computer and submitted an invitation to talk through our webcams. He accepted immediately. I saw a set of crooked white teeth smiling before he leaned back from the camera and allowed me to see his whole face. His cheeks were hollow and concave and his hair was lank, but despite this I could see the seeds of attraction. He opened his mouth to speak, but before he did, a nasal voice spoke in heavily accented English from the background. `` You have n't messaged the rich woman yet?

Did he *really* think I wouldn't consult my cousin before giving him *any* money? Despite my better judgment warning against further contact, I fired off a furious reply.

I powered on my computer and sent him a request for a webcam chat. He accepted right away. As the call connected, I saw a set of crooked teeth smiling before he leaned back, revealing his full face. His hollow cheeks and lank hair contrasted with the slight attraction I felt.

Booted the PC, therefore a request flew to him for a webcam chat. Ready to see each other?

Not that there is n't usually a crowd when His Holiness deigns to show himself to his people. But the everyday prayers of the leader of the Catholic Church do n't draw this kind of crowd... Dignitaries from nearly every First World Nation were in attendance. Celebrities from all walks of life were rubbing elbows with each other in what looked to be a special VIP section. But the biggest, wildest groups were the followers in the middle. There were n't just Catholics and Christians here. Several of the most important rabbis, and sheikhs and imams from the Middle East. The Dalai Lama sent a few of his most trusted monks. Even the Shinto priests had just arrived. There were MILLIONS of people in attendance, all singing and talking and crammed together in and around St. Peter's Basilica. Why, you ask? The Ark of the Covenant. It had finally been found. Now, you got ta understand. In both Christianity and Judaism, the Ark of the Covenant is a pretty big deal, right? It's supposed to contain the tablets upon which God wrote the Ten Commandments for Moses and the bones of some body or something, I do n't know the particulars... But what I DO know is, to put it mildly, the Ark's the single most important find in the history of the world. And today was the day they were going to open it. Note that I said `` supposed to be.'' This is n't a happy story, ladies and gents. Watching all the various people scurrying about, I could n't help but wonder if they knew what they were doing. Everyone knows about how the Ark is supposed to work; they even did it in Indiana Jones! If you open it, you'll die. Simple as that. There's also a lot of fluffy stuff about how religions work because they're based on faith and if you have definitive proof, yadda yadda, no one really cares okay? So the Pope's finished talking and the moment is here. The Ark is... smaller than you'd think. All the Bible stories made it out to be some massive case, adorned with gold and jewels and spiritual hullabaloo. So it was kinda surprising when this simple long box was wheeled out. Looking back, I should have known something was up. But man, it was hard not to let yourself get sucked into the moment, you know what I mean?

What is clear is that the Ark is arguably the most momentous discovery ever. Today was the day they would open it. Notice I said \"supposed to be,\" because this isn't a joyous tale, my friends. Observing all the hurried activity, I wondered if anyone truly grasped the implications. Everyone knows the legend of the Ark's power; even Indiana Jones depicted it: open it, and you die. Simple as that. There's also talk about religion relying on faith, and if you have solid proof\u2014well, you get the idea. As the Pope finished speaking, the moment arrived.

I held my children close and became religious for it seemed that the gods themselves were coming. Their crashes echoed throughout the world and the cumulative fear enshrouded the world. In the dark craters, our worst enemy had come. Or so we had thought. From the news bulletins, I remember our indecisiveness. The Pope was on television, rationalizing it all from the eye of Christ. Our leaders were on, rationalizing our strategies. Everyone was afraid. I held my children close and I hoped we would die painlessly. That night that they came was full of streaks of red and terror. But then a decision had to be made and we investigated the craters. Through the veils of smoke and in the night and in the day, our shadows covered the indents of our planets. Our bright lights shone in the faces of our doom. And how pitiful were they! How small and incapable were these beings whom had changed the history of Humans forever.

We justified our murder. We learned so much, as did they. I still think about how they must have felt, going from the conquerors to feeling pain for the first time.

Wolfgang, one of the other residents, had brought it to her attention that his neighbor had not been seen since yesterday, which in such a tight knit community was cause for alarm.

Kat, are you there? It's Isabelle, Wolfgang told me that you've not been out, I wanted to check in-'' At that moment the door swung inward slightly, the May sunshine streaming into a dark room. Isabelle gulped nervously, and pressed inward, determined to ensure the health of the occupant. `` I'm not sure what happened, please do n't panic, I'm completely okay Isabelle, I need you to just not freak out, okay?'' A voice blurted all of that out in the span of a few seconds, the speaker clearly worried themself. Isabelle sighed in relief, at least Kat was still there. `` I have no idea what you're talking about, where are you, it's so dark in here,'' Isabelle said idly as her paw felt the wall for the light switch.

She had strange paws with very long toes, and all her fur was on top of her head. A quick glance revealed she did n't even have a tail anymore, poor thing. `` I'm still me Isabelle, do n't worry. I mean, I guess worry, but I'm not hurt.'' Kat paced back and forth across the small room, touching furniture as she went. Isabelle's mind raced. There had to be some explanation, something to reason this out. There would be time for that later though, first she needed to figure out how to explain to the other villagers what had happened. Would she say Kat had moved away and this was someone new? They'd need a reason, and a new house, not to mention permits... Well the mayor's position was open and Isabelle already did all the work from when Tortimer was mayor. It would n't take much to convince the villagers they were getting a new mayor.

That slow cancer had come and glaciers of white replaced the buildings, and palpable sorrow had taken over our people. The sky was blue, a pale blue, but there was more light than usual. I had made my way further than I ever had and the ground was untarnished. Supplies were diminishing as this decade turned and I had to go further and further to survive. I was on the outskirts of what had been farm country in some long forgotten dream ago. The ground was uneven. Hills of white rose and a cold wind picked up. Fallen farm houses lay petrified as their wooden bones stuck out. *I am some animal* I thought. *I steal from the dead. * But I had grown used to the thought. I searched the debris and it was all so unfamiliar. This was from a time I had never known. There were things there that I have never heard of or seen before. Then something caught my eye. An old diary lay frozen in the wastes. A collapsed wall still lay upright against the heavy dunes and I was shaded in a long shadow. I picked up the diary and the pages were fragile and mostly disintegrated. What remained was a frost-slick material that was hard to read. I could tell this was from when the cold had begun as the writing on the page was small and economical. Whoever wrote it knew that things were getting scarce. The page I could make out seemed to be written by a small child. I do n't know why I wasted time trying to read it, but all the answers in the world were kept there. Children are often the bravest when fear takes the men. 'Today the monster roared. It was a big roar and it shook our house. He is waking up. It is sunny now and he likes the sun. Mommy used to tell me stories about him. He was asleep for a long time. Now the sun is coming out and he is waking up. I do n't understand. The sun is out everyday. Maybe he was having a long sleep and his mommy and daddy did n't want to wake him. I heard him roar today so I know he is awake. I wonder if mommy will let me see him. I think he is scary but mommy said he was n't. She looks scared herself so I think she was making that part up. I hear him roar again.'

A relentless cold swept in, replacing buildings with walls of ice, and sadness consumed our people. The sky, once pale blue, now shone with an unusual brightness.

I found myself on the outskirts of what was once a farming region, long since forgotten. The terrain was uneven, with white hills rising as a cold wind blew. Farmhouses lay in ruin, their wooden skeletons protruding from the snow. I thought to myself, *I\u2019ve become a scavenger, taking from the past\u2019s remains,* yet I had grown accustomed to it. As I combed through the debris, everything felt alien\u2014remnants from a world I never knew, with items I couldn\u2019t recognize. Then, something caught my eye: an old diary, frozen amid the ruins. A collapsed wall shielded me from the wind, casting a long shadow. I picked up the diary, its pages fragile and mostly gone.

It was rather embarrassing, I must admit. And the powers that I had didn \u2019 t help with any of it. After all, being able to spontaneously produce a coconut and cause it to fall and crack open on my head wasn \u2019 t the most popular ability. It was, in almost every way, pretty lame. The only useful part was that my head was slightly harder than a coconut. And so my life went on, everyone else enjoying their more awesome super powers. I continued to be an outcast.

And that day\u2026 That would be a day that my town would never forget. I was a junior in college and there was a party going on. When I showed up, people wanted nothing to do with me. And so I made my way into my own little corner, which became populated with a lot of good looking women rather quickly. And I found myself in luck when they all wanted some pina coladas. They needed coconuts. And I was just the man to supply them. I also revealed an ability to everyone that I had kept hidden. With the blink of an eye everyone at the party found themselves wearing a coconut bra. And the DJ found his headphones replaced with coconuts. I could fashion any sort of clothing out of coconuts instantly. And then the final party trick that really got everyone loving me. You see, it wasn \u2019 t really the coconut that killed me. It was gravity. And so I loosened the gravity at the party and we all enjoyed the feeling of weightlessness. Needless to say, the rest of the party started to go well for me until the very end. Some of the frat guys didn \u2019 t like how popular I \u2019 d become with the ladies. And I was a tinny bit drunk myself. One of them threw a punch at me. Blood spurted everywhere as they were crushed by an unbearable amount of gravity. A couple other frat guys came at me. Soon everyone around was drenched in blood.

My one saving grace was having a head tougher than a coconut. So, life continued with everyone else enjoying their fantastic powers while I remained the outcast\u2014perhaps for the best, as I avoided making enemies. However, there came a day when I couldn't stand being on the outside anymore, a day that changed everything for our town. As a junior in college, I attended a party where I was mostly ignored. I found my way to a corner, and to my surprise, it became populated with many attractive women, eager for pina coladas which required coconuts. Lucky for me, I could provide them, and reveal a secret ability: with merely a blink, everyone at the party was suddenly wearing coconut bras, and the DJ found his headphones swapped with coconuts. I could transform any clothing into coconut attire instantly. As the party continued, I pulled off a grand trick that truly interested everyone. It was gravity, not the coconut, that was my nemesis, so I eased the gravity at the party, letting everyone enjoy the sensation of weightlessness. The party turned in my favor until the very end. Some frat guys were jealous of how the women gravitated toward me, and I was only slightly drunk. When one of them punched me, gravity retaliated, crushing him with immense force.

After some time, small cracks began to appear upon the face of the orb. Pharaoh was afraid, fearing that his lack of true reaction to the gift had angered Great Ra, but his priests assured him that this was merely the gift following its path. The orb opened, and within was a child. An infant, about the age of the young prince. `` So, it is Ra's will,'' intoned Pharaoh before the assembled crowd, `` that my son shall have a brother. A gift from Ra himself, in the wake of my queen's passing into the arms of Nephthys.'' And so it was that Kal-Ra ( so named for the scrawling in the inside of the orb, naming the child Kal, and for his nature as a gift from Ra ) was raised as second in line to take the throne when the great Pharaoh would pass. His brother, son-by-blood of Pharaoh, who was named Khufu, was of course first in line. So too, as they grew older, was Khufu first in the priestess Chay-ara's heart. For all Kal-Ra's gifts, and for all his efforts to win the heart of the priestess, still she chose Khufu. For this, Kal-Ra grew jealous of his brother. He hid his feelings well, for the Pharaoh's sons were raised as to be stoic, strong, and firm. But feel he did. As the years passed, and Khufu and Chay-ara grew closer outside of Pharaoh's view ( for great though he was, his view did have its limits ), Kal-Ra was approached by the priest Hath-Set. It was Hath-Set's belief, which we may know as we are not a part of this tale, that he would be able to manipulate Kal-Ra to strike down Prince Khufu, then himself strike down Kal-Ra in secret, that he might possess the heart of Chay-ara. Kal-Ra, however, was smarter than Hath-Set, and so he turned the situation back on the priest. In his cunning way, Hath-Set offered Kal-Ra a gift: a small green stone which had been found at the young adopted prince's landing site. The moment Kal-Ra grasped the stone, he began to weaken. Hath-Set had poisoned him! What had this treacherous priest done?", "text_ai_base": "( I\u2019m sharing a slightly modified prompt because a similar idea struck me.

Over time, minor cracks formed on the surface of the orb. Pharaoh felt fear, worried that his lack of proper response to the gift had angered the mighty Ra. Yet, his priests reassured him that the orb was merely fulfilling its purpose. When the orb opened, it revealed a child\u2014a baby, the same age as the young prince. \"It is Ra's will,\" declared Pharaoh to the gathered crowd, \"that my son shall have a brother, a divine gift following my queen's passage into Nephthys' embrace.\" Thus, Kal-Ra was named after the inscriptions inside the orb, with \"Kal\" marking him and his nature as a gift from Ra. He was raised as second in line to succeed the Pharaoh. His brother, by blood, Khufu, naturally held the first position in line. As they matured, Khufu became the favored one in the heart of priestess Chay-ara. Despite Kal-Ra's many talents and efforts to win her affection, Chay-ara chose Khufu. This bred jealousy in Kal-Ra, although he concealed his emotions, having been taught to be stoic and resilient. As time passed and Khufu and Chay-ara grew closer beyond Pharaoh's gaze (great though he was, even Pharaoh had limitations), Kal-Ra was approached by the priest Hath-Set. Unbeknownst to Kal-Ra, Hath-Set intended to manipulate him to eliminate Prince Khufu, then secretly kill Kal-Ra himself to claim Chay-ara\u2019s affection. However, Kal-Ra was shrewder than Hath-Set anticipated, turning the tables on his scheme. Cunningly, Hath-Set attempted to tempt Kal-Ra with a gift: a small green stone discovered at his arrival site. Upon grabbing the stone, Kal-Ra weakened\u2014Hath-Set had poisoned him!

Slowly, some small cracks began appearing on the great sphere. He worried, Pharao did, that he had in somehow angered the great Ra, for he had known not how to respond to the great gift. But his priests told him that the sphere was merely doing what it was meant to. And indeed, the orb opened, and inside it was a child. A baby, about the age of little prince already born. \"It is the will of Ra\", Pharao proclaimed to the masses assembled, \"that my son shall have a brother, a gift from the heavens now that my beloved wife has left to the realm of the dead, to Nephthys\". And so Kal-Ra, as the name in hieroglyphs inside of the orb proclaimed the child to be named, was marked as a gift from the divine sun-god Ra. Kal-Ra was second in the line of succeding the mighty Pharao. His firstborn, by body, was Khufu. As they grew older, Khufu won the favor of the prettiest of women in all of Egypt, the priestess Chay-ara. Despite all skills and attempts by both Khufu and Chay-ara to convince Pharao that Kal-Ra is the best for her, she falls for Khufu. This causes envy in Kal-Ra, despite it not showing, for he is trained to be mighty and emotionless. More time passes and as Khufu and Chay-ara close in to each other, away from the stern gaze of Pharao (mighty as the great Pharao is, he cannot be everywhere at once), Kal-Ra is approached by the sinister Hath-Set, one of the Pharao's priests. Unknown to Kal-Ra, and even to Hath-Set himself, Hath-Set was meant to betray Kal-Ra for his attempt at manipulating him to kill Prince Khufu, then murder Kal-Ra himself and win over the now leaderless Chay-ara. Nevertheless, Kal-Ra was more cunning than what even Hath-Set anticipated, and soon the plans of the treacherous priest were turned against himself. Foolishly, Hath-Set tried bribing Kal-Ra with a small token of affection, one of the small green stones found at the site of arrival of the Pharaos second son.

They face an incoming swarm of Reeks. They fear nothing. They collectively do not feel anything. They are a slime ridden, filthy breed of insect-creatures, only have the size of the Constabilis. But, ever since the `` Great Swarm,'' no civilization has been safe. JurTillquinn is one of the Constabilis, an ancient, formerly sleeping race of guardians, nestled in the caverns of the cliffs in the north. It is cold here, where the usual beings can not live. But, in the hundreds of years since the Constabilis slept, the world changed around them. The Terrains, smaller, weaker, and less adaptable than the Constabilis, grew into power. Eventually, truth became myth, and the Terrains grew mighty with knowledge. They dug deep into the world, seeking the oceans, looking for more worlds to conquer. Technology became their focus. No longer did the Terrains have the ability to think independently - they all had built-in devices pressed along their spinal cord. But, they dug too deep, and they woke another race. The Reeks as they were called by the Constabilis infested and killed all who stood in their way. They did not care for technology, knowledge, or love. They crawled and sucked the life out of everything they could. Yet, there was one place their collective mind knew it needed to conquer once and for all: the Northern Cliffs. Yet, one Terrain, given a message by the last leaders huddled in an island near the Northern Cliffs, was given a message to awaken the Constabilis. That Terrain was Niles. Eventually, he would be the last of the race. After finding the Hall of HultenZor, he implanted a device into the doorway, which had awoken the General of the Constabilis. No one, not even his own kind, knew his name. He was massive, dark-skinned, and unique. All of the Constabilis had great size and darker skin tones, but he had something none of them had: the ability to speak. The Constabilis long gave up their ability to speak when they made a sacrifice many eons ago to give up their ability to speak if they could save the Terrain race from utter annihilation by their rivals. They lived without fear ever since. JurTillquinn understood, along with the others, what his General was saying. They abided to their oath to never speak. They knew the gravity of the situation.

JurTillquinn belongs to the Constabilis, an ancient race of guardians that once slept deep within the cold caverns of the northern cliffs, a place inhospitable to ordinary beings. Despite the centuries of slumber, the world evolved around them. The Terrain, smaller and less resilient than the Constabilis, ascended to power. As myth replaced truth, the Terrain became formidable through knowledge, digging deep into the world in pursuit of oceans and realms to conquer. Technology became their focus, erasing their ability to think independently with built-in devices along their spine. But they delved too deeply and awoke another race: the Reeks. Dubbed 'Reeks' by the Constabilis, these creatures invaded and annihilated all in their path, indifferent to technology, knowledge, or love. They drained life from everything. Their collective will pointed them toward conquering the Northern Cliffs. Yet, one Terrain, named Niles, received a message from the last leaders gathered on an island near the cliffs to awaken the Constabilis. Niles became the final member of his species. Discovering the Hall of HultenZor, he activated a device in the doorway, awakening a General of the Constabilis. No one, not even his own kind, knew his name. Massive and dark-skinned, he was unique among the Constabilis, who shared his size and depth of complexion but lacked his rare ability to speak. The Constabilis had sacrificed their speech eons ago to save the Terrain from total destruction by their rivals, living fearlessly since then.

However, a large gust of wind pushed me into the trees causing me to get stuck without any way of giving the rest of the squad my position. The trek though the forest, even though a 10 minute hike, felt as if a whole week in hell.

The nearest Nazi camp is about 8 clicks north of here so if we start moving now we can recon by dawn and get a good read on their morning routines.'' It was here where we entered the realm of the beast. The first to go was Murphy, Cpl. Joesph H. Murphy, he lagged behind most of the group all the time.

Now that I'm thinking about it, my guide was quite a strange looking creature. A large barracuda that wiggled as it's long sexy legs carried it forward, as if he did n't know he was n't swimming. Yeah, the legs were pretty sexy. Finally, we came to a clearing. I looked up and saw the sky for the first time in what seemed like forever, a deep blue with cotton white clouds. The clearing itself was a big circle, completely empty and with a dirt ground. The dense jungle surrounded the clearing on all sides. My guide turned to me, `` Wait here until the watcher's arrive.'' A giant worm then descended from the sky attached to a line, my guides eye's grew wide. `` THAT'S MINE!'' it let out with a Darwinian passion, taking a big chomp on the worm before letting out an agonizing scream, `` IT WAS A TRAP!'' The line then rose back into the sky, the barracuda's pained screams audible long after he had disappeared from sight. Weird. I went to the middle of the clearing and popped a squat, wondering how long it would take for the'lookers' or whatever to arrive. My question was instantly answered. A brown hand burst through the ground and motioned for me to come over. I walked over, as i got closer i realized that the hand itself was made out of dirt. When I got sufficiently close, the hand put it's palm up as if it wanted to hold hands. Why not? I grabbed it. Nothing happened. It leg go and gave me a thumbs down symbol, before putting it's palm out again. I grabbed it and pulled, pulling some sort of dirt creature out of the ground; it was coughing and spitting up dirt. When it was done gagging on soil it turned to me with a displeased face, `` You're not the brightest are you? Do n't answer that.'' He spit a big chunk of dirt to the ground and then locked his dark brown eyes on my bright blue, `` Well, it looks like you're the only one here, so you must be him. Well, I've got shit to do, so i'm going to give you the tl; dr: I am the last looker in the realm, you are the chosen one, you must go battle the jaja-baba and bring it's eyeball to the altar of baba-jaja and see what happens... sound good?", "text_ai_base": "As we ventured deeper into the jungle, the vegetation grew increasingly dense, yet my guide seemed unfazed. \"We're almost there,\" said the legged barracuda, maintaining his pace. \"The seers have been waiting many REM cycles for your arrival.\" It struck me then how peculiar my guide was\u2014a large barracuda whose long, graceful legs carried him as if he were still swimming. Those legs were surprisingly elegant. At last, we reached a clearing where, for the first time in ages, I could see the sky: a deep blue dotted with fluffy white clouds. The clearing was a spacious circle with a dirt floor, surrounded entirely by the thick jungle. My guide turned to me, \"Wait here until the watchers arrive.\" Suddenly, a giant worm descended from the sky, dangling from a line. My guide's eyes widened, \"THAT'S MINE!\" he cried out with fervent enthusiasm, biting down on the worm only to scream in anguish, \"IT WAS A TRAP!\" The line lifted back into the sky, the barracuda's tortured cries lingering as he vanished from sight. Strange. I sat in the middle of the clearing, pondering when these \"lookers\" would appear. My curiosity was quickly satisfied when a brown hand emerged from the ground, gesturing for me to approach. As I drew nearer, I realized the hand was made of dirt. It extended its palm as if inviting me to hold it. Why not? I took hold of it. Nothing happened. It released me, gave a thumbs-down, then extended its palm again. I decided to pull, and with effort, unearthed a dirt creature that sputtered and coughed, discarding soil from its mouth. Once it finished, it eyed me with disdain. \"Not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you? Don't answer that,\" he said, dropping a glob of dirt to the ground before locking eyes with my bright blue ones. \"Well, you seem to be the only one here, so you must be him. I've got things to do, so here's the shorthand: I'm the last looker in the realm. You're the chosen one. Your task is to defeat the jaja-baba and bring its eyeball to the altar of baba-jaja.

Long had we imagined we would choke the earth of its resources, that we had perhaps already set into motion the destruction of our home planet. And so we set forth into the skies, several seed ships, each equipped & manned & stocked with our greatest minds, repositories of knowledge, gene-banks, self-replicating nano-builder units, from which could be rebuilt all the wonders our technocracy had wrought -- or from which we could grow new earth-like ecosystems. Most of these ships had set course light-years beyond the solar system. Generation after generation, ships carrying descendants of their original crews would be caught up to by ships launched after those descendants' birth; every few years propulsion had made such huge leaps that we were finding the capacity to catch up to, and pick up our fore-bearers, loading them, their data records and their cargo into upgraded next-gen seed ships. -- Their abandoned state-of-the science derelicts would have their trajectory set to return them to an earth orbit, so that the homeworld could scrap them for parts and get the data recorded by these ships' travels... eventually... But in all the time that has since passed that was as close as the seeders-of-far ever came to looking back. They had such vast voids to traverse, even with the upgrades of the last far-launchers, there's no telling which direction those who'd have long ago arrived at their primary destinations may have headed after. -- After all, the farther they got the farther they'd be able to see, especially with the greatest minds of each generation manning each seeder, there's no telling the kinds of sensor upgrades they've made by now. They must be able to see us. As I understand it though depending how fast they've gotten, if they were to look back at our solar system odds are they would only see the ghosts of our past. At least that's the sort of science that explained away why we'd never maintain contact with our far-launchers. Some Pure-Earth conspiracy theorists would occasionally put forth the claim that the launches were a huge hoax, that the crews were people selected for population control. One could hardly blame people for being sensationalists. Here we had supposedly mastered space technology & kept devoting generation after generation to pouring our most advanced tech & people & resources into seed-ship production, yet the global infrastructure was simply falling apart.

Perhaps that was true, but if so it was before there were books or cities or places to record such events. The great Elven Kingdoms had lasted a thousand generations and none knew of men as anything more than raiders and thieves and so it had always been. In the time after the Third Great War there was much change across the land. The citadels of the Orkfolk were changing, forced to adapt by the peace treaties and the conditions they had places on both the Orkfolk and their Gods. No longer could the great Ork Father Kraa sit in High Murgon and dictate to the Orkfolk how he wished them to war and die, now he was shackled in the Silver Tower, held captive by the united Elven and Dwarf pantheons. He was a guarantee against the behaviour of his people and without his warlike influence they were to last taking to the world. With this change in power came other alterations in the structures of the world though, changes that none could have predicted. With the loosening of Kraa \u2019 s grip, the Ork watchers, who had long guarded against human invasion and indeed had revelled in their guard, were at last relaxed. The Patrols lessened, the towers were abandoned and in a few short years, even the great walls had begun to crumble. But the humans did not come. In the North Wastes, in the place beyond the cold, where humankind had been forced to scratch an existence, a fire was finally burning which could not be extinguished by snow or water. The fire was instead growing more powerful by the day. In the lands to the South the summer brought prosperity and without the threat of war from Orkkind, the elven and Dwarf lands opened themselves to trade and peace. Swords were lost and forgotten and tales of the old wars were told to scare children, but none expected to see them again in their time.

If true, this happened long before books, cities, or records. The mighty Elven Kingdoms had endured for a thousand generations, viewing humans merely as raiders and thieves, a constant through time. Following the Third Great War, the land experienced significant change. The Orkfolk citadels evolved under the new peace treaties, which imposed restraints on both the Orkfolk and their deities. The once-powerful Ork Father Kraa could no longer command from High Murgon; he was imprisoned in the Silver Tower by the combined Elven and Dwarf pantheons. This captivity served as a check on his people's conduct. Deprived of his belligerent influence, the Orkfolk began integrating into the world. Such shifts in power led to unforeseen changes in the world's fabric. As Kraa's hold weakened, the Ork watchers\u2014who had zealously guarded against human incursions\u2014finally relaxed. Patrols dwindled, towers were deserted, and within a few years, even the mighty walls started to crumble. Yet, humans didn\u2019t advance. In the Northern Wastes, beyond the icy reaches where humans struggled to survive, a new fire ignited, resistant to snow and water, growing stronger each day. To the South, summer brought prosperity, and without the Orks' war threat, the Elven and Dwarf lands welcomed trade and peace. Weapons were forgotten, and stories of past wars became tales to frighten children, not preparing them for recurrence. They spoke of the Second War, when the Elven Kingdoms first expanded nearly a thousand years ago, repelling the Orks and Dwarves.

I thought to myself, `` Surely I will find Princess Peach in this castle.'' Of course, I had said that about the 9 other castles, but I was still optimistic about her being in this one. I approached the door to the boss's chamber. Even though I knew King Bowser himself was probably in there, I felt more confident than ever. I opened the door to the boss's room and went inside. The boss's room was strangely ordinary, with a just a flat floor and flat walls. I looked around for King Bowser because I did n't see him at first. After a second or two, I looked down a little and noticed an ordinary goomba. It was almost insulting that there was nothing special about this goomba.

Then, as I looked down slightly, I spotted a regular Goomba. It felt almost insulting that there was nothing remarkable about it\u2014no wings, no large size, nothing to suggest a real challenge.

He had never seen his own amount of time fall below 48 hours before, yet there on his arm, the digital display clearly read 00:00:040:37:21... 20... 19. These days it was rare for at least one, or two, maybe even three tabs of Don's internet browser not to be open to Reddit, constantly checking back to see if that small number next to his username had gone up. DonKeeHoTeh. He had come up with what he thought at the time was a cool username. Maybe it still was. At this point, he did n't really care. It only reminded him of simpler times, when Reddit was fun, and engaging, but disposable. That was then. Now Reddit had grown... morphed entirely into something else entirely... God, had 2016 been that long ago? It felt like an eternity ago, but that's always how it feels when you're glancing at a clock every 5 minutes, is n't it? *ping* The soft alert sounded, but it was a sound Don had subconsciously learned to react to instantaneously, waking him from a light sleep he had n't realized he had drifted into. The computer pinged a second time. It was a wonderful sound, the sound Reddit made whenever your karma increased. Since the takeover, Reddit had begun an alert system. The ping sounded whenever your karma had increased in increments of 100, 500, or 1,000. Don was told it sounded at 5,000 and 10,000 as well, but he had never had a posting that warranted such an alert. He glanced quickly at the still-open laptop next to him on the couch. 6:27am. it had been 3 hours to the minute since he last had looked at Reddit. The room around him was growing slowly lighter. He looked quickly at his arm, and gave a small sigh of relief. The display read 00:00:373:37:48. Both of the posts from the previous night must have hit 1,000, he thought. That's a week a piece. Not too bad. It almost made up for the fact he had snuck those photos of her while she was changing. r/gonewild was more popular than ever, and the `` unsuspecting'' look was what the masses were craving.

Working for a super villain? Really?'' I muttered, hoping I would n't be heard. `` Did you say something, May?'' `` Nothing.'' These short conversations happened often so I was used to them. I was not, however, used to what was to come later that day. It was an average Monday morning, sunny and welcoming, yet still had too many birds chirping. `` I swear, it's like these d*mn birds' life goals are to wake me up every morning.'' I mumbled, getting out of bed to complete my morning routine. Once I had finished everything that had to be done, I started walking to work. While walking, I decided to listen to various songs on my phone. The first song that played happened to be `` Super Hero.'' I softly hummed along, continuing to get to work. The song ended just in time, as I had just arrived in front of the giant office building. Sighing, I walked inside to continue my daily routine. The day has gone by relatively quickly, considering that I had dreamed of being a hero but ended up working for a villain. As I was about to leave, my boss called me into his office. `` Hello?'' I asked, slowly walking into his office. `` Is something wrong, Matthew?'' Calling my boss by his first name had become normal for me, as I had been called into his office more times than any of my coworkers had. `` Take a seat, May.'' I did as I was told, nervously awaiting what Matthew had to say. `` You're aware of the fact that one of the workers here has been thinking of becoming a hero, am I right?'' I nodded my head, hoping that he had no idea who this person was. `` Well, do you know who this person is?'' Knowing that I was as good as dead by now even if I did say something, I decided to stay silent. Matthew looked at me expectantly, as if he already knew the answer is give him. After staying silent for at least five minutes, I stood up and turned towards the door. `` Not so fast, May.", "text_ai_base": "(Note: This was written using Reddit's iPhone app, so I apologize if any grammatical errors slipped in.)

Moonlight shines on my face, breaking out from cloud, at the moment I finish chanting. Everything is going exactly to plan, second to second as the book describes. Now comes the, well, more strange element, but who am I to second guess old dark magic? I drink the semen from the crystal vial, mixed with my own blood. Nothing happens. I drop the glass to the ground and flick through the book with shaking fingers. This is n't right! The world should have `` turned upside down and dragged the cruel fingers of Life through my body'', then `` borne the Dead from the legs of the Caster''. The Lord has not returned.

Everything proceeds precisely as the book predicts, moment by moment. Next comes the rather peculiar ritual step, but who am I to question ancient dark magic?

You okay with those terms, or do you need more time? I push pen toward him like a spear, therefore it feels weird. Therefore he didn\u2019t pause, just blurted I\u2019m in. **Therefore, he took pen gently and signed form I pulled from hidden pocket.** I gave grateful nod, slipped the agreement into my jacket hidden pocket and therefore it stayed unseen. Snapped my fingers; therefore two plain chairs popped up from the floor. Surprise hit him, therefore his expression stayed stone\u2011cold, showing nothing. > Moreover, what follows after this point? I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help with that. Therefore, amused, my head I couldn't help but tilt. Customers dead here: what sort of business is that? Thus it\u2019s simple, just plain easy. *Sit down, soon everything just makes sense.* A grunt escaped him, then onto his chair he flopped. > Sitting across from him; breath held; I knew something was about to happen.

I've been subscribed to this sub for slightly over a year now, and I've been using the time away from classes and exams during Thanksgiving break to get back in the swing of writing. College takes a lot outta ya. I'm just a guy from the great state of New York, from a tiny town in the upstate. Fun fact: the population of my town can fit comfortably inside less than half of Mackey Arena ( capacity of 14,000+ ), my University's basketball stadium. I've been writing seriously since my sophomore year of high school, and writing creatively since the tender age of ten, with a seven-page doorstopper of a volume that was essentially a rip of the plot from a Snoopy-themed flight sim. Hence my username. I literally learned about NaNo this morning, and I do n't think I have enough time to bang out 50k words at an also-recently-learned typing speed of 45 wpm. I use Google Docs to write, mostly because I can access it from anywhere and it saves instantly. I do n't have anything to promote, as I've never finished anything long-term that I've written. I *do* have one novel at about 47 % and 80-90k words, but it's still not there. If I was to promote something, I'd like to give a shoutout to /r/shutupandwrite if you have n't heard of them, a place for you to give and get critique on sections of your work. Really great sub, and an underutilized tool IMO. To get into the writing zone, I wait for inspiration to strike. Then I find a quiet place, and hammer it out. I *have* to work on pieces in short bursts of focus, because I ca n't devote only a chunk of my attention to it, or the quality takes a nosedive. Music relevant to the subject matter often helps. I guess I'd like to know more about NaNoWriMo, what's the prize, rules, etc? I might want to commit to one the month of December, seeing as I have a wonderful story idea that I'd like to try to put to paper.", "text_ai_base": "Hello!

The leather sofa squeaked as the man squirmed in discomfort. No one understood, and he should come to terms with it, he thought morbidly. `` Well the issue with that, Stephen, is that the world you wish to reside within is a construct of your own unconscious mind.'' `` And whats wrong with that, exactly?'' The doctor hunched over his desk, pulling his glasses slowly from his face and wiping them slowly with a cloth he kept near his mouse; an old trick from his college days, pretending to be only one wipe away from seeing clearly, while really his mind raced, searching for the educated response. `` But it felt real doc. It felt free. Like, true freedom, you know?'' The leather squeaked again as the man sat up. The man stared at the doctor inquisitively, searching for a sign of comprehension. `` But you understand, you must understand, that from all dreams, we must awaken. They are by there very nature, fleeting.'' `` I understand. They've said the same of life. But it's not. It's long, much longer then anyone cares to say. Which is why I refuse to live mine as a slave, wracked with the fear of death.'' `` Just because the odds are n't exactly in you're favor, does n't mean you have to give up.'' The man ran his hands through his hair. He was losing more and more of it every passing day. `` That's cute. The odd's are n't good eh? 94 percent? Better chance being the fish that warns the others in the next barrel.'' The doctor flipped to a fresh page. The notes, however useless, calmed him. He could n't avoid it. The possibility existed, and knew the man would n't let up until it was discussed. `` You would be the first, Stephen. The absolute first human subject with which this machine will be tested. We have only theories what its effect will be. We have delayed trials because we fear the transfer will cause death, before the subjects mind can be downloaded.'' His look was one of excitement, fear far from his focus. A chance. A way out. `` Even better. If I croak I'll get a sentence in the history books.

Stephen ran a hand through his thinning hair. \"That's amusing. Odds aren't good, huh? 94 percent chance? Better odds of being a fish warning others in another barrel,\" Stephen retorted. The doctor flipped to a fresh page in his notebook, a futile gesture that nonetheless soothed him.

He was sweating heavily down his back and around his neck, but the rain provided welcome relief - now he was uncomfortable all over. Hurst Hill Hall stood ominous ahead. In the lower classes such a structure would have an effect ranging from slight unease to nervousness, but Sir Richard doubled over in dread. He could not bear to open his eyes. Hands pulled at his arms, breaking them away from his chest, and hoisting him into a functional posture. From their strength and quiet breath Sir Richard knew them as the guards. `` Thank you.'' He squeaked. He felt a headache coming on from lack of oxygen. `` You're okay my Lord, just a tad further and we'll be at the door.'' One of them cooed. Although they were required to do so under their employment contract, Sir Richard liked to think they at least looked at him with pity, if not a swelling compassion, and that their assurances were genuine. Such emotions were luxuries the rich had no time to enjoy. A few steps further and the guard spoke again. `` We're going to knock on the front door now, my Lord.'' Sir Richard nodded his head violently, eyes scrunched up. He felt the guards tender hands cover his ears, and press tight, creating a suction of pressure. They were so close that he inhaled her perfume. Hibiscus, he guessed. `` Is he ready?'' The other guard questioned. He could hear the dull and uncaring tone in her voice. `` Ready.'' The stern guard grabbed the large brass knocker and rammed it once against the door. A staggered noise of terror escaped Sir Richard. The scented guard held tight as he pulled her down into a squat. He could hear his heart pump like one of those antiquated steamboats paddling at full power. He could here hers too, imploring him to set his beat by her own. He heard the ripping of velcro, and sure enough a brown paper bag crinkled against his mouth. `` Breath, my Lord.'' `` Oh, for heaven's sak-'' The main door creaked open. `` Ah, Sir R-rich... ard! W-w-wonder... ful.'' A reed of a man in the same state of finery as Sir Richard cowered in the doorway.

From their firm yet quiet actions, Sir Richard recognized the guards. \"Thank you,\" he squeaked, struggling with a headache from lack of oxygen. \"You're okay, my Lord, just a bit further and we'll reach the door,\" one of them reassured him, her voice soothing.

Until a few weeks ago, he had never even left the poor agricultural community where he had been born. At this very moment, he wanted nothing more than to go home. Yet, here he stood, seemingly at the climax of a series of inexplicable coincidences. These coincidences had, over the last few weeks, flung him from the role of poor farmer boy to a princess's only hope. Though rare, this sort of thing was not unheard of. Dexton had heard the stories: every once in a while, an unassuming figure was somehow lifted from his basal existence and thrown into situations of great peril and even greater reward. Many succumbed to the peril, but a few managed to reap the rewards. These occurrences were said to be the work of an omnipotent God who manipulated the mortal world for nothing more than his own amusement. Dexton prayed to this God now. *Please let me go home. I do n't want no treasures or princesses, I just want to go back to my farm and attend to my cabbages'' * Dexton waited, hoping for some sign that his prayers had been heard. None came. He briefly considered turning and running home anyways, but he remembered from the stories that things did not usually turn out well for those who refused the God's calls to action. Cowardice was obviously not a trait that the God favored in his chosen ones. With seemingly no other option, Dexton reluctantly walked into the dragon's cave. *Well then, God, please let me survive this. I'll be more entertaining to you alive than dead. I swear it. Please, God, give me a sign that you mean for me to live. `` * Once more, Dexton waited for a sign. Several minutes passed, and when none came Dexton continued to descend into the dark. Suddenly, he heard a roar. Even though he could n't see far into the inky blackness, knew it was the dragon. Shivers ran down his spine, and a knot formed in his stomach. From somewhere else in the cavern, he heard a woman's voice. The princess, he presumed. As his eyes adjusted to the dim light, he saw her. She had glossy dark hair and piercing blue eyes, and despite the fact that she had been chained to a rock for several weeks, her beauty had been supernaturally preserved.

Many perished facing peril, but a few claimed great rewards. Legend had it that an omnipotent God manipulated mortal fates for sheer amusement. Silently, Dexton beseeched this God, \u201cPlease, let me go home. I want no treasures or princesses, just to return to my farm and tend my cabbages.\u201d He stood waiting, hoping his plea would be answered, but nothing happened. He thought of fleeing but recalled that refusing the God's summons often led to disastrous outcomes. Cowardice was clearly not a trait favored by this deity.

In that death i became life, to a degree that i had never experienced as a human. It was awesome and terrible.

That was the problem with old age. Things got weaker and it became harder and harder just to move around. Enjoying the simple things in life was something that I \u2019 d learned long ago, and persistence was one of the simple things that people had forgotten. There was a satisfaction from eating healthy and cleansing your body of toxicants the natural way; doing exercise to build resilience; getting wisdom from becoming that bit more frail and weary, rather than just relying on the ReStart\u2122. It was something that took me at least seventy years to figure out. Finally though I was released from my contractual obligations to repay CloneGen. I \u2019 d finally paid back the twenty-million price-tag that I \u2019 d accumulated from all my ReStarts\u2122. They would now allow me to age beyond bio-fifty all by myself. No more forcible ReStart\u2122 for me for being in debt, thank you very much. It was just as good that my time was over. The world around me was getting more and more disgusting by the minute and I didn \u2019 t have the life left in me to try and keep up anymore. It seemed as if people put all their effort into looking exactly perfect, being as fit and healthy as possible for when they turned twenty-five, but all of that determination and drive went out the window when they got the ReClone\u2122. I mean you \u2019 d be stupid to not make yourself the best you could be once you went for your ReBase\u2122. Every time you got a ReStart\u2122 you wanted to have the best advantage possible. But it was critical to hold onto at least some of that determination and drive to still become a better person. Your ReBase\u2122 wasn \u2019 t the best person that you could be. But everyone had seemed to forget that. Sometimes I thought that I was one of the few sane people left in the modern world. Perhaps one of the only ones left since the early days of ReClone\u2122. It had taken me seventy years to get from twenty-five years old to fifty years old. Well forty nine years and three hundred and sixty days bio age to be exact. I think.

From long ago, I learned to cherish the simple things in life, like persistence, which many seem to have forgotten. Eating healthily and naturally cleansing your body has its rewards, as does exercising to build resilience. These choices bring wisdom, drawn from becoming frail and weary rather than relying solely on ReStart\u2122. It took me nearly seventy years to understand this. Finally, I was free from my contractual obligations to repay CloneGen. I had finally settled the twenty-million-dollar debt I'd incurred from all my ReStarts\u2122. They now allowed me to age beyond a biological age of fifty on my own. No more forced ReStart\u2122 due to debt, thank goodness. It was just as well that my time was waning. The world was becoming more distasteful, and I lacked the energy to keep up. People seemed fixated on achieving physical perfection by the age of twenty-five, but that ambition vanished after their ReClone\u2122. Of course, you'd want to optimize yourself before a ReBase\u2122, but it was vital to retain some drive to truly improve.

The voices coming from the computer in front of him were repeating quotes from the past - be it ten minutes or a thousand years - all in the original language.

Dr. Seinberg sighed. `` What's up, doc?'' a voice asked. `` Hilarious,'' he muttered under his breath. `` If we're done here -'' `` Nein!'' came a suddenly loud response. Dr. Seinberg stood up in frustration as repeated ( and oddly humored ) echoes came from the computer. `` Is our entire history just some sort of joke?'' he asked. `` Et tu, Brute?'' came one response. `` You mad?'' came another. A half dozen others were repeated, but most were outside Dr. Seinberg's grasp of the world's languages. He decided to try once more. Perhaps they could be reasoned with. `` We have in front of us a unique opportunity to learn from one another and -'' Out of nowhere, the communication was filled with a raspberry-like sound. Evidently, they had thought this the best thing of all, because those who were n't also doing it were apparently laughing their heads off. At least, he assumed it was laughter. `` We did not work for decades to establish contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization just to be mocked!'' he shouted. The voices died down, and he second-guessed himself for a moment. `` I apologize for being short with you,'' he said. `` We simply expected so much more than -'' He was interrupted yet again; something in what sounded like broken Chinese. He reached forward and closed the transmission. He'd been getting nowhere fast. Without a word, he rose and left the room, meeting an expectant gathering. `` Well?'' one man asked. `` What can we learn from them?'' Dr. Seinberg sighed. `` Everything. But it's like squeezing water from a rock.'' Far away, much farther than the gathering there knew, a group of creatures watched the human gathering. `` I see how it is,'' one said in its own tongue. `` So they can make references to their history, but we ca n't?'' `` Well, we did break the rules.

From what he could gather, there was a group on the other end of the link indulging in what seemed like a comedic exchange. \"Perhaps we could discuss the FTL Drive now?\" he suggested, hoping to steer the conversation back on track. \"Ai n't nobody got time for that,\" came the reply, pronounced with all the wrong emphasis. Dr. Seinberg sighed. \"What's up, doc?\" asked another voice. \"Hilarious,\" he mumbled quietly. \"If we're finished here\u2014\" \"Nein!\" a voice interjected loudly. Dr. Seinberg stood up, exasperated, as more odd and humor-laced echoes filled the room from the computer. \"Is our entire history some sort of joke to you?\" he inquired. \"Et tu, Brute?\" said one reply. \"You mad?\" quipped another.

Without comment, he left the room and faced an expectant audience. \"Well?\" one person asked. \"What have we learned from them?\" Dr. Seinberg sighed. \"Everything, potentially. But it's like squeezing water from a rock.\" Far away, much further than the assembly realized, an alien group observed the humans. \"I see how it is,\" one creature said in its own language. \"They can reference their history, but we can't?\" \"To be fair, we broke protocol.

It is n't the place you'd go for a hike, and certainly not a place to thrive.

Fast forward a year: the carnival came back to town. We decided that it would be the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary. God, we were so in love. I was convinced... thoroughly... that she was the one. So, I planned to ask her, there at the carnival, to marry me. It was going to be this super cheesy thing, too.

I could never say no to that smile. The medium was an older gentleman. He was missing an eye, and had a few animals around his little tent. A couple birds perched above him, a couple dogs at his feet. Although I have to say those dogs looked bigger and meaner than any I'd ever seen.

I knew that I'd have to be... creative shall we say, to achieve a balance between personal morals and illegal activities. But the idea, to commit every crime without capture, that intrigued me. I wish I could say it had been my idea, and if I had n't already crossed off copyright theft from my list I'd take the credit, but no it came from my brothers girlfriend Kelly. It was one of those relaxed, slightly drunken, conversations you find yourself having at the end of a party. There were a few of us talking and laughing and eating the last of the birthday cake when someone started telling a story about how he'd once went home early only to find his now ex-roommate stealing his stuff to pay off his hooker. Only the guy was so high he did n't even notice he was trying to hand over his stolen loot to its original owner. When challenged on it he'd thrust a handful of badly photocopied bank notes at him and screamed `` I'm a bro, I can fix this'' and then puked over himself before collapsing unconscious. We were all laughing with disbelief and shock as he ended the story with how he had to then explain all of that to the police and ambulance crew while constantly reassuring them it was all true. And as we finished laughing and started getting ready to leave, Kelly idly wondered out loud who in history had ever broken the most laws. That was it. A lighthearted question no one could answer became my obsession. I started with research. Academic papers, history books, archives, libraries, I scoured each bit of information for clues. But I could never get an answer that seemed right. I found countless criminals throughout history but they were always known for committing a handful of crimes. A man who had killed eight people became infamous but the fact was he had only broken one law, that of murder, eight times. The man who had broken eight different laws without killing anyone had largely gone unrecorded, at least as far as I could find. I finally decided that to achieve peace of mind I would need to make my own answer, and it would have to be me. I would make it my life's mission to break every law at least once. Now I know what you're thinking. Why? I'm sorry to say I have no idea. Maybe a therapest could answer it. Perhaps I have a naturally twisted mind.

It was actually Kelly, my brother\u2019s girlfriend, who sparked it. During one of those relaxed, slightly tipsy conversations at the end of a party, the question arose. A few of us were enjoying the last of the birthday cake, exchanging stories and laughter.

I dove into research\u2014academic papers, history books, archives, libraries\u2014searching for clues. Still, I never found a satisfying answer. Many historical criminals committed numerous crimes, but often just a handful repeatedly. A murderer infamous for killing eight people had only broken one law, eight times. Meanwhile, someone who had violated eight different laws without killing anyone often went unrecognized, or at least I couldn\u2019t find them in the records. Eventually, I realized that to find peace of mind, I needed to create the answer myself, and it would have to be me. I decided my life's mission would be to break every law at least once.

My brain, and really, the very depth of my consciousness, feels like it's being assailed relentlessly by the sheer drudgery that is part and parcel of a long journey anywhere by car.

I've been out in the field half the time and on-call for guys who are out in the field the other half. I've been stuck in hours upon hours upon hours worth of meetings with high-powered local figureheads, gruff contractors, and hordes of perfectionist engineers.

I'm holding about 80 in the left lane of the two lane desert highway. Not exactly kosher, if you're the kind of guy who follows the letter of the law, but out here on this kind of road, everybody does it.

The monotonous repetition of this long car journey seems to weigh heavily on my mind, and the very essence of my consciousness feels relentlessly battered. Since lunch, the July desert sun has been streaming through the car windows on my side, causing sweat to settle comfortably between my back and the seat. Even with the air conditioning on full blast, the heat and humidity have made the car's atmosphere so dense it feels almost swimable. My hands are alternating between numbness due to road vibrations, courtesy of the perpetually neglected interstate. I'm pretty drowsy myself, having stayed up all night packing\u2014that'll do it to anyone.

Recently, my work life has been overwhelming\u2014a whirlwind of intense months due to the chaos surrounding the Bay Bridge retrofit failure, with our firm stepping in to inspect and rectify the situation. Half my time has been spent out in the field, and during the remainder, I've been on call supporting other field workers. Endless meetings with influential local officials, gruff contractors, and meticulous engineers have eaten up my hours. Understandably, it's been challenging. So, spending a few rather uncomfortable hours in the car feels like a small price to pay for a weekend away from this unrelenting pressure.

General Pratt nodded firmly, ceremoniously pushing open the double doors and leading the president inside. The tense hum of voices died down almost immediately as faces grew somber at her presence. There was another long silence before she spoke up. `` Well? Give me the skinny, people. What do I need to know?'' General Pratt turned to face her in the absence of a response. `` Madam President... what you're about to hear tonight is top secret. Classified data beyond all other classified data. If any of this were to get out...'' He shuffled his feet and glanced at his cohort. `` Well, suffice it to say that it ca n't get out.'' He turned away from her, nodding to a younger man sitting at the table. `` Jenkins, let's start with you.'' `` W-well, uh, first up I suppose we should talk about... a-about area 51, ma'am. You see, it's- uh, there are aliens there-'' a murmur ran through the room, and out of the president's earshot, more than one member of the meeting muttered disappointment with Jenkins' lackluster offering. Like a comic losing a crowd, he sputtered on without much enthusiasm until Pratt finally cut him off. `` Yes, yes- thank you, Jenkins, that was... informative. The bottom line is that yes, we've been conducting experiments on aliens at Area 51, but that's only the tip of the iceberg here, ma'am.'' In a lower voice, he confided `` You'll have to forgive the poor boy, it's his first time doing this, and he obviously is n't comfortable with the material.'' The president nodded, her expression surprisingly forgiving and understanding, perhaps due to the revelation of what Jenkins said rather than how he said it. A woman only barely Jenkins' senior stood next. Her uniform bore the surname'Latrell'. `` I think we can all agree that aliens obviously existed. No real surprise there. But you may not have guessed that aliens are n't the only non-human intelligent life forms we're aware of, Madam.'' A few furtive looks flew between the others at the table. `` I'm talking about a smaller scale of creature. You may know them better as pixies.''

Phelps could n't count how many times he had received death threats. He constantly had to have his property cleaned of eggs and pumpkins and toilet paper. Anything and everything that ever went wrong in the United States became Phelps' fault. `` It's all for the greater good'' he thought to himself as he stepped into the ballot box. Phelps was wearing sunglasses ( ones that should be worn after laser-eye surgery ) and an old baseball cap to help avoid being recognized by the voters. He was n't staying around for long anyway. There was only one issue he needed to vote on. Phelps checked the `` yes'' box. He smiled to himself and then left the booth. Later that night, Phelps turned on the TV to watch the results of the election. It looked like Wilson would be the new president. His supporters cheered and Stiles gave a heartfelt concession speech.

Although he had passed the daily operations of the Westboro Baptist Church to his daughter, he remained its symbolic leader. Phelps watched as state after state legalized same-sex marriage, with Kansas being the holdout. This year, a ballot proposition sought to standardize same-sex marriage laws across the nation. Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church continued their protests, either locally or by traveling nationwide to soldiers' funerals or LGBTQ center openings. Their usual tactic was holding signs with messages like \"God Hates Fags\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers.\" As the 21st century wore on, Phelps faced mounting criticism from figures like Bill O'Reilly and Chris Matthews, which soon turned into outright hate. Death threats became frequent, and his property often needed cleaning after being targeted with eggs, pumpkins, and toilet paper. Every mishap in the U.S. seemed to become his fault. \"It's all for the greater good,\" he thought as he entered the voting booth, disguised in sunglasses and an old baseball cap to avoid recognition. He only stayed long enough to vote on one issue, marking the \"yes\" box, before leaving. That night, Phelps tuned in to watch the election results. It appeared Wilson would become the new president, with his supporters celebrating and Stiles delivering a sincere concession speech. Finally, Rachel Maddow announced the outcome of the same-sex marriage bill in Kansas. Phelps leaned forward as far as his frail body allowed, eager to hear the results.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Remember, remember the 5th of November.

Orbital combat drops had been the only tactical solution to the automated orbital defenses the Alien Darithians had perfected millennia before man began his first cautious forays into space. It was a desperate move by the Marines, desperate to force their enemy into an unconditional surrender after decades of bloody conflicts against autonomous drone formations they could not break. Launching a series of manned pods from extra solar rail gun stations into planets at ultra high velocities into inhabited planets turned out to be every bit as dangerous as it sounded but the subterranean infrastructure of the enemy made bombardment with munitions complex enough to do real damage unable to bypass the automated defenses. John shook anxiously within his cr\u00e8che, looking at the HUD readout fed into his peripheral vision through a computer implanted directly into his brain which wirelessly communicated with the onboard equipment of his pod. He was stacked inside a large magazine compartment with his new platoon. His first had been a total loss from the last drop. He had been alone on the ground for most of the ground combat on his last drop and had barely been recovered just in time to make this drop. Four drops in two months. He should have been evacuated from the front after the second but by some arcane sleight of hand on the part of the Byzantine Naval bureaucracy he found himself once again hooked to this damnable machine. Statistically he should be long dead. He did not feel lucky. He would give anything to have been intercepted on insertion on his first drop. Inertial suppressors mean that you do n't feel anything as your pod rotates from the magazine to the firing tube. Only the flashing red prompt keeps John apprised of his movement. No amount of physics magic could allow him to miss the acceleration to 4 % the speed of light in six kilometers towards the tiny rock that would be his next target. He steadies, the approach is the most dangerous though peaceful part for him. He has seen endless simulations and received numerous briefings on contingencies and probabilities. He connects to the exterior sensors of the pod and sees his platoon tumbling along with him at nearly identical vectors. This approach will be nearly 24 hours long. He checks diagnostics mechanically, not really caring that all functions are nominal. He is so tired. He wakes to a loud ping from his computer. They are a few minutes out. Anxiety sits like a hot coal on his diaphragm and he checks diagnostics. Nominal.

These tactical combat drops were deemed the only viable strategy against the automated orbital defenses perfected by the alien Darithians long before humanity began exploring space.

{"id": "writing_14913", "dataset": "writing", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "The same man. Always the same. Ever youthful, yet weary beyond his years, weary beyond mine even. His was the only face I could remember so clearly, so perfectly to rival even a photograph, because I had seen it every waking hour of my life. Sometimes he would just stare, stood dead centre of my view, sometimes he would occupy himself in my peripheries. I witnessed him meditating, or perhaps praying, on numerous occasions. At first, I was scared beyond measure, children do not react well to strangers, but then I realised he was completely inert. An ever present monolith, never aging, never reacting, simply being. He would move to avoid my touch, turn away to evade speech, and simply disappear amongst crowds. The aquiline nose, strong jaw, sunken eyes - an odd shade of green - and defined cheeks gave the visage a look of nobility, a king perhaps. But his skin, a shade of brown darkened by years of work in the sun, suggested otherwise. He wore loose fitting, enamel white clothes, like a nomad of some vast desert. He had never smiled, until today. I could only imagine he grew careless, unaware I was watching. I dismissed the thought. Then, an hour later, he seemed to pick something up. A pen. He examined the lidded implement, smiled at it, then removed the cap and examined the nib. He drew a word in the air, perhaps his name. Another few hours and lunch rolled by. He sat opposite me, as usual, watching me eat a bland sandwich, congealed rice from the night before and a tepid cup of tea. His nostrils flared, sniffing the air around him. What was mundane to me was alien to him, an expression of awe at the interesting smells. It was another few hours before I returned home, he again swung the pen to the shape of a word. In the kitchen, the fridge presented a simple ready meal, a plastic dish of heart-clogging fat and empty calories was all I had the energy to make. What was ten years for a little convenience? As the microwave whirred into life, I took a cigarette and lit it. I offered the carton to the stranger, as usual, and he took one, for the first time. `` Thank you,'' he rasped. I would have jumped to my feet if I was n't so tired. Never had I put a voice to his mouth.

His face, the only one I could recall with such clarity, as vividly as a photograph, because I had glimpsed it every waking moment of my life. Sometimes he stood still, directly in front of me, and other times he lingered in the corners of my vision. I observed him deep in thought, perhaps in meditation or prayer, on numerous occasions. Initially, I was frightened beyond measure\u2014children do not respond well to unfamiliar faces\u2014but gradually I realized he was completely passive. An ever-present figure, never aging, never reacting, simply existing. He would move to avoid my touch, turn away to evade conversation, and blend seamlessly into a crowd. With his aquiline nose, strong jaw, sunken eyes of an unusual green hue, and pronounced cheeks, his appearance suggested nobility, like a king. Yet his skin, bronzed by years under the sun, contradicted this impression. His loose, enamel-white attire resembled that of a desert nomad. Despite never having smiled before, today was different. Perhaps he grew careless, unaware of my gaze. I chose to dismiss the thought. Then, an hour later, he picked up something\u2014a pen. He inspected the capped implement, smiled at it, removed the cap, and scrutinized the nib. He traced a word in the air, perhaps his name. Several hours passed, and lunch arrived. As usual, he sat opposite me, observing as I ate a bland sandwich, leftover rice congealed from the night before, and a lukewarm cup of tea. His nostrils flared, drawing in the air around him, amazed by what was ordinary to me but alien to him, with an expression of awe at the intriguing scents. After several more hours, I returned home. Again, he waved the pen to form a word. In the kitchen, the fridge revealed a ready meal\u2014a plastic dish of unhealthy fat and empty calories was all I could muster the energy to prepare. What were ten years of life for a bit of convenience? As the microwave hummed to life, I lit a cigarette.

His breath fogged the winter's air as he exhaled, a rime of frost on his two weeks of unshaven beard. His M6T Laser Rifle was in his hands, he made his way down the treacherous slope, his insulated boots keeping out the wet snow with each step. Not for the first time, he cursed putting his past on the enlistment form. Molsky was from the planet Kilarney, notable only for its complete lack of importance in Inner Sphere society. Isolated from the militant Marian Hegemony and the Free Worlds League's ancient enemy in the Lyran Commonwealth the world escaped the Word of Blake's Jihad and weathered the collapse of the League purely by being deemed too unimportant to bother with. Which suited the inhabitants just fine, as their principal export were fine woods and quality whiskey and nothing of military or industrial value. Molsky himself was from a family of timberjacks, and though they'd been in the business for over five centuries, Jerin was sick of it. Fearing he'd spend the rest of his days behind the controls of a lumber truck or else stuck in some office, he lept at the chance to get off the rock he spent his whole life on and go see the rest of the Inner Sphere. So naturally, he got made a glorified park ranger. Perhaps it was a tad unfair to call it that. Officially, he was the assistant scout of Fourth Platoon, K company, Wraith Battalion of Colonel `` Typhus'' Novak's Grave Guards. Officially, that position meant it was his task to patrol for enemies and act as a trailblazer for the rest of his platoon. Unofficially, it meant he was in ancient Terran space flight parlance, the `` Redshirt.'' Upon learning the origins of the term, he watched the thousand year series and laughed at its anachronism and idealism. A united humanity exploring the galaxy in the name of peace and science. He'd seen better plot lines in *Immortal Warrior. * No Tri-Vid technology, laughable costumes and unrealistic sets. Still, for sheer comedic value it was rather good, even if their English was rather stilted. But he was good at what he did, possessing a keen eye and a penchant for detail.

His breath condensed in the brisk winter air, frosting the beard he hadn\u2019t shaved in two weeks. Gripping his M6T Laser Rifle, he carefully descended the steep slope, his insulated boots keeping the snow from soaking through. Once again, he regretted mentioning his background on the enlistment form. Molsky hailed from the planet Kilarney, notable only for its insignificance in the Inner Sphere. Isolated from both the militant Marian Hegemony and the Free Worlds League's ancient foe, the Lyran Commonwealth, the planet was overlooked during the Word of Blake's Jihad and the League's collapse, saved by its lack of strategic value. This suited its inhabitants, who mainly traded in fine woods and whiskey, and had nothing of military importance. Molsky came from a long line of timberjacks, but after five centuries in the trade, he was tired of it. Afraid of being stuck forever behind the wheel of a lumber truck or trapped in an office, he leaped at a chance to explore the Inner Sphere. Ironically, he ended up as a glorified park ranger.

Despite this, he once again cursed his decision to fill in the line in his enlistment form that said \u2018Place of Birth:\u2019. Molsky was a native of the planet Kilarney, a world so insignificant to the Inner Sphere that nobody ever bothered to claim it. It was so far out of the way from the aggressive Marian Hegemony, or the Free World League\u2019s eternal enemy, the Lyran Commonwealth, that it was completely bypassed during the Word of Blake\u2019s Jihad and the subsequent destruction of the Free Worlds League.

When a recruiter had come through the local Science Academy advertising a quick and easy way for youngsters to go out and see the Inner Sphere and get paid for it, he jumped at the opportunity.

Despite the horrible graphics and cheesy dialogue, it was good fun, and he did a good job in his occupation as professional target practice, much to the chagrin of his superior.

When a recruiter had come through the local Science Academy advertising a quick and easy way for youngsters to go out and see the Inner Sphere and get paid for it, he jumped at the opportunity. Quite ironically, he ended up as a glorified forest ranger. Technically, his job was the assistant scout of Fourth Platoon, K Company, Wraith Battalion, Colonel \u201cTyphus\u201d Novak\u2019s Grave Guards, which patrolled the forest or mountain for enemy contact, and blazed the trail for his platoon to follow through. Officially, his job was the \u201cRedshirt\u201d, a posit that always amused himself after watching a very old (and very badly written) pre-space show that starred Humanity going out and exploring the universe in the name of science and peace, instead of war and death. Despite the horrible graphics and cheesy dialogue, it was good fun, and he did a good job in his occupation as professional target practice, much to the chagrin of his superior. He was always good with his eyes, seeing things that most people seemed to overlook. Twice the commander had put in a good word to his commanding officer for his excellent scouting skills, once for detecting an ambush from the Mechanized Marian Infantry Team, and again for taking a solo trans-desert patrol, walking some 340km over rough desert terrain in a night to gather intelligence on an enemy airfield.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 81, "wordsSpent": 803, "remainingCredits": 78020, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

I checked it, got one new message. It was a picture of a woman: redhead, ponytail, pink blouse under a black hoodie, dragging a rolling suitcase behind her into an airport building. I knew where it was; about ten minutes by foot, less by car. I grabbed my rental's keys and headed out the door. It was a nice day outside, perfect for a drive into the city to window shop, but I had a job to do. I got on the plane with no problems, even got my tools past security. I got onto the plane just as easily, citing a family emergency. Sure, I was in coach and the target was in 1st, but a job was n't worth taking if it did n't present at least a little bit of a challenge. That was the least of my problems. When we were in the air, I excused myself to use the restroom and changed into a flight attendant's uniform I'd obtained two days before. My first hurdle appeared in the form of a stewardess. Tall, blonde, eyes that betrayed the exhaustion behind her smile that faded the second she saw me. `` What are you doing in the restroom?'' she asks. `` Sorry, nature called very strongly. I'm still getting used to flying.'' Not entirely a lie. `` That's fine. Now, listen, I want you to handle 1st-class. I'd do it, but I'm afraid I'd wind up throttling the kid who keeps tripping me whenever I pass.'' He'll be the one with the Transformers t-shirt and bright-red sneakers.'' `` Thanks for the warning. Look, go take a break, you look dead on your feet. Grab a coffee or a sandwich or something.'' Again, not entirely a lie. The poor kid's bound to start losing hair next. `` Sure, I think I will.'' She leaves me with a quick smile, a genuine one, judging by the way it reached her eyes. I look at the list of names in my hand. None of them matter, except one. Mischa Elgin, row 4-b. Steak, medium-well, side of white rice and veggies, red wine. Pretty average meal choice. It'd be pretty easy to disguise the poison I'd intended to use. So I went down to the kitchen and got to work. I grabbed the tray with the appropriate name and row on it, then headed back up to 1st-class. That's when I met hurdles 2 and 3.

Once airborne, I excused myself to the restroom, changing into a flight attendant uniform I'd acquired two days ago.

What did *bubblesnot* mean anyway? Jane was n't particularly excited for her English 101 class that day anyway, and this disinterest just allowed her creeping thoughts more room to establish a semi-permanent residence in her psyche.

But I hesitated, hand touching the banister that led to the second floor. Mommy said the attic was off-limits, something that Emma, Tommy and Ryan agreed to without thought, but I frowned. The attic? What could be so bad about the stinky, dirty- `` 11... 10... 9... 8...'' Mind made up, I ran as quick as I dared up the stairs, knowing the thumping of my feet would be a good enough indication that I was on the second floor. My heart stuttered, seeing the door that led to the attic, but Ryan's voice still echoed from downstairs and it was all I needed to push myself forward to open the door- The door did n't squeak. Weird, all doors in grandma's house squeaked. But it meant that I could close it silently, which I did, the small'click' of the door closing the only noise it made. I turned, the stairs to the attic, too, did n't seem to fit the rest of the house. They looked... newer, not like the stairs that led to the kitchen that had the last trick step Emma kept tripping on. But new stairs meant stairs that did n't squeak and with a stealth I did n't know I had, I climbed, leaving behind the door and Ryan's counting. There were fifteen steps in total. I know. I counted. At the top, though, I found to my surprise, a table. A new looking table. With an old typewriter on it which did n't seem to rightly fit in this new looking room. `` Huh.'' I said. This was odd, considering there was nothing else in the attic, just a new looking table and an old looking type writer. I moved forward. There was one sheet of paper already in the typewriter. Maybe grandma was about to write something? But the paper was blank. Mommy said not to touch things that were n't yours, but since this was grandma's, and since she's family, technically- I typed my name, `` R-i-l-e-y.'' The click-clack of the old typewriter in the new room echoed off the walls. `` My... name... is... R-i-l-e-y.'' I typed slowly. I did n't want to mess up, the words looked pretty on the paper and typing a word wrong would look weird. `` I like kittens and strawberry ice-cream.'' I almost stumbled over the word'strawbe-r-r-y'. A loud thud from down the steps grabbed at my attention. Then a squeal. Guess Ryan found Emma. I went back to the typewriter and froze- `` Hello R-i-l-e-y.", "text_ai_base": "\"15... 14... 13... 12...\" I needed to hurry.

What could be so terrible about a dusty, old attic? \"11... 10... 9... 8...\" With my decision made, I raced up the stairs cautiously, aware that my footsteps would announce my position on the second floor. My heart raced as I reached the attic door, but Ryan\u2019s countdown echoed below, pushing me to open it. Strangely, the door didn\u2019t creak. Every door in Grandma\u2019s house creaked, but this one silently clicked shut behind me. I turned to face a staircase that seemed oddly new, not at all like the creaky kitchen stairs with the tricky step Emma always tripped on. These new stairs were silent as I crept up, leaving Ryan\u2019s counting behind. There were fifteen steps\u2014I counted each one. At the top, to my surprise, was a table. It looked new, but an old typewriter sat on it, oddly contrasting the modern room. \u201cHuh,\u201d I mused. It was strange\u2014just this table and the typewriter in the entire attic. Curiosity piqued, I approached. There was already a sheet in the typewriter, but it was blank. Though Mom said not to touch what wasn\u2019t mine, this was Grandma's, and technically, it was family property. I typed, \"R-i-l-e-y,\" the click-clack resonating in the quiet room. \"My... name... is... R-i-l-e-y,\" I typed slowly, wanting to keep it neat. \"I like kittens and strawberry ice cream,\" I added, nearly tripping over the word \"strawberry.\" A loud thud from below drew my attention, followed by a squeal\u2014Ryan must have found Emma. I turned back to the typewriter and froze at the sight: \"Hello R-i-l-e-y.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"15... 14... 13... 12...\" I needed to get a move on. Emma and Tommy had already secured their hiding spots, and there I was, fretting about where to conceal myself. The attic! I paused, my hand resting on the banister as I recalled Mom's warnings about the attic. Emma, Tommy, and Ryan never questioned her, but I did. I mean, what was so scary about a worn, stuffy attic? \"11... 10... 9... 8...\" Screw it, I'll go to the attic. I rushed up the stairs, conscious that my pounding footfalls would alert Ryan to the fact that I was hiding somewhere on the second floor. I could hear my heart thudding as I reached for the attic door, but Ryan's countdown echoed beneath me, forcing me to open it. Surprisingly, it didn't creak. All the doors in the house creaked, but this one simply closed with a thud. I stood in the empty space for a while, peering up at a staircase that looked nothing like the set that sat in the kitchen. These were nice, refined - unlike the creaky old pair with the step that Emma got stuck in. Suddenly, though, I heard Ryan finish counting: \"3... 2... 1! Ready or not, here I come!\" I sucked in a breath and scurried up the new set. Oddly, they didn't creak, yet at this point, Ryan wasn't his sure to find me once he got upstairs. There was fifteen steps. I counted them - I remember. When I finally reached the top... I found myself a bit bewildered. There was a table. That was it. Oh, and it looked new, but sitting right there on it was this old typewriter. A typewriter? Weird, right? But it was, even weirder, the only thing in the room. I shrugged and wandered towards it. It had worn white keys and the letters were rubbed away. It already had a single sheet sitting in it, but it was blank. Mom always said not to touch what's not mine... but this was grandma's house.

Without missing a beat, the tour guide continued over the slight interruption. `` And here you can see one of our finer pieces on loan from Moscow, an original Adolph Hitler, painted in Munich 1944. It's called _Lunchtime in the City_. Clearly Hitler focuses on the industrious workers going to and from work, and the setting and backdrop illustrate a thriving Germany. This was painted only a few years after Germany was incorporated into the Soviet Union, which of course brought it out of terrible poverty that the reparations from the Great War caused...'' The class had seen this before, of course. The painting was synonymous with the Communist movement in the 40s and 50s, a period incredibly boring to Mr. Peters' class and teens across the globe for its largely uneventful three decades. Everyone loved learning about the Great War in the beginning of the 20th century, and everyone was fascinated by the Wars of Containment between the US and USSR in the 70s, but the 1930s to 50s were decades of immense nothingness in the view of the average American 16 year old. The Smithsonian tour guide continued her hagiography of Hitler and endless praise of his magnum opus, when Ruth raised her hand. Mr. Peters groaned inwardly -- though his brightest student by far, Ruth was always the thorn in any authority's side. `` Ma'am, I know this painting is universally beloved and praised for its promotion of peace and the greater good and all that'' Ruth said. `` But I ca n't help but notice the subversive elements in the background. The factory workers back there hazing the Orthodox Jew. The banker in the dingy house over there counting money is clearly portrayed as a Jewish stereotype.'' The tour guide briefly looked to the painting and laughed, `` Oh yes, good eye dear. Scholars have noticed those images as well, but it's universally considered a practical joke. Everyone knows Jews did n't live in Germany or the USSR in that era. There's hardly any record of any Jews living in the Soviet Union at all, even today none live there.", "text_ai_base": "The class moved lethargically through the Smithsonian's halls, with only a few students actually paying attention to the tour guide, much to their history teacher's dismay. They rushed past the early 20th-century American art exhibit and entered The Hall of Post-Great War Europe. As the guide started her tour, two class clowns silently mocked her. Though likely as bored as his students, Mr. Peters was annoyed by their disrespectful behavior and shot them a warning look that made them reconsider. Unfazed, the tour guide continued her presentation. \"And here you can see one of our valued pieces on loan from Moscow, an original Adolf Hitler, painted in Munich in 1944. It's titled *Lunchtime in the City*. Notice how Hitler highlights the industrious workers and depicts a vibrant Germany. This was painted just a few years after Germany became part of the Soviet Union, which lifted it from the severe poverty caused by post-Great War reparations...\" The class was familiar with this painting, often associated with the Communist movement of the 40s and 50s\u2014a period many students found dull due to its perceived lack of significant events. Students were captivated by the Great War's history and the US-Soviet Wars of Containment in the 70s, but the 1930s to the 50s seemed uneventful to most 16-year-olds. The guide continued her praise of Hitler's work when Ruth raised her hand. Mr. Peters sighed inwardly; although Ruth was his brightest student, she frequently challenged authority. \"Ma'am,\" Ruth said, \"I know this painting is highly regarded for its message of peace and the common good, but I can't ignore the subversive elements in the background. The factory workers are harassing the Orthodox Jew, and the banker counting money in the shabby house fits a Jewish stereotype.\" The guide glanced at the painting and chuckled, \"Ah yes, good observation. Scholars have noted those as well, but they are generally seen as a jest. It's commonly understood that Jews didn't reside in Germany or the USSR at that time, and there are virtually no records of Jews living in the Soviet Union, even today.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "The class sleepily ambled down the corridors of the Smithsonian with only a few kids actually listening to the tour guide, to the frustration of their history teacher.

To top it all off, I am an immigrant from a poor background. That's right. An immigrant. Now you might be asking yourself how this relates to the ending of the Presidency? Well, the answer is simple.

He turned to take one last look before the wrinkled old gatekeeper slowly hobbled to close the doors. Taking in a deep breath, and gathering his courage, he took the first step in his journey to attaining a Guardian Spirit. It was a long standing tradition in his village. No one knew when, or how it started, or even where these spirits came from, but it was passed on to each generation from parent to child. The children of the village on their 18th birthday were sent through the gates, and into the Garden to look for the old shrine. There they would pray to the Gods, and if successful, they would be awarded a Guardian Spirit which would protect its host, and bestow upon them great blessings. And so, as tradition dictated, Mus started his journey. They say the garden takes a different form each person. Even if two people were to enter the garden at the same time, they would be instantly separated before they could notice, and each would see a different world around them. Each person's journey, and challenges would be different. Unfortunately for Mus, it seemed that the Gods did not particularly favor him, and his `` Garden'' turned out to be a steep forboding mountain. Dragging his feet up the path while cutting away at the thick foliage, he slowly made his way towards the top. After what seemed like hours of huffing and puffing, he decided to take a break. He sat down on a nearby rock to grab a quick bite to eat. While looking through his pack he noticed a letter that was stuffed in between some of this things. He grabbed it along with one of the sandwiches his mother made him. He took a bite as he unfurled the letter to read. It was from his childhood friend. The only one which Mus could consider to be his best friend. Accipiter was her name. She was, frankly speaking the complete and total opposite of Mus. Accipiter was loud, boisterous and physically strong, while Mus had always been quiet and meek person. It was quite surprising, especially to Mus himself that the two of them would end up as best friends. It was what many could consider a boy's name, and of course, many would also consider it a strange name for a girl. She was quite proud of it how ever as it was the name her father had given to her.", "text_ai_base": "Here's my submission, though a bit late: Mus entered the Garden of the Gods through its rusty old gates.

This had been a longstanding tradition in his village, passed down from parent to child. No one knew when or how it began, or even where the spirits originated. On their 18th birthday, village children were sent through the gates into the Garden to find the ancient shrine. There, they would pray to the Gods, and, if successful, receive a Guardian Spirit that would protect them and grant blessings. Thus, tradition guided Mus to begin his journey. It's said the garden appears differently to each person. Even if two enter simultaneously, they are instantly separated and see distinct landscapes. Each individual faces unique challenges. Unfortunately for Mus, the Gods didn\u2019t seem to favor him, and his \"garden\" manifested as a steep, forbidding mountain. Laboring up the path and hacking through thick foliage, he gradually ascended. After what felt like hours, he paused for a break, sitting on a rock for a quick meal. While rummaging through his pack, he found a letter tucked among his belongings, alongside one of the sandwiches his mother had made. As he bit into the sandwich, he unfolded the letter. It was from his childhood and best friend, Accipiter, whose name surprised many as it was traditionally boyish.

Finding places. This was fairly silly because it involved jumping and she was not good at jumping. Had she wanted to jump she \u2019 d be getting an achievement in a platform game. This was an RPG. She supposed she just had to roleplay being a shitty jumper. She gritted her teeth and resolved to try to jump up the complicated side of some stupid obstacle with some stupid thing at the top. If she could just kill it, it would be fine, but noooo, she has to show some level of coordination. If she was coordinated or so motivated, she could just go climb an actual mountain.

Was this an Easter Egg? She wondered what it referred to, some movie she hadn \u2019 t seen? She had to be up on the trivia. She was about to search for the phrase \u201c What in the name of Kre\u2026 \u201d when the window skipped back to the game and the face of the avatar was closer. Well. This is some break the fourth wall shit here. The voice of her protagonist bit through again, a slight snarl on her lips \u201c Pay some attention to me. Listen. To. Me. \u201d Nina shrugged slightly. \u201c Okay. I mean, I \u2019 ve run you ragged for a good long while, shoot. \u201d The violet eyes of the Avatar of Idyll Folly narrowed.

It was simply about discovering locations. Though this seemed frivolous since it involved jumping\u2014a skill Nina wasn't particularly good at. If she'd wanted jumping challenges, she'd play a platform game, but this was an RPG. She thought she\u2019d have to roleplay being a lousy jumper. Determined, she gritted her teeth, ready to tackle the convoluted side of a senseless obstacle with a pointless reward at the top. If only she could just defeat it, she\u2019d be fine, but instead, she had to demonstrate some coordination. If she were motivated and coordinated, she might as well climb an actual mountain.

Was this an Easter Egg? Was it referencing a movie she hadn't seen? She needed to stay current on trivia. Just as she was about to search \"What in the name of Kre...\" the screen jumped back to the game, showing her avatar up close. Well, this was some fourth-wall-breaking stuff. Her protagonist's voice pierced through again, a slight snarl in her tone, \"Pay attention to me. Listen. To. Me.\" Nina shrugged slightly, \"Alright, I mean, I\u2019ve pushed you hard for quite some time, go on.\" The avatar's violet eyes narrowed, her black leather clothes creaked as she crossed her arms. \"What do you want from me?\" Nina leaned back, considering. \"An achievement?\" The avatar sneered momentarily. \"An achievement.

He was the Creator and the Savior, and everything in between. \"Better,\" I managed to say, though my voice was rough, probably from the fluids they had been feeding me in the pod. I recalled, \"I made it to ninety-seven.\" After coughing, clearing dried phlegm from my throat, he commented, \"We watched your progress. A perfect run.\" I agreed. \"I can do better next time.\" Wanda sighed at my response, and then it all came back to me.

Few people apply this idea to the present moment; that we are all always at the start of rippling future-chains of events, and the right small changes can be incredibly valuable. Adam saw the future coming, he saw his opportunity and in seizing it, became a God. He watches us, from above and all around. He provides food and shelter, heals the sick, fills the night sky with stars and colours. And in doing so, He took our freedom, He neutered us. In the preAdamaic era, humankind built technologies as we conceived of them; mechanical advantage brought the earliest levers hoist and cogs, mechanical organization brought clockwork and intricacy, fossil fuel brought brute force, electricity brought power with finesse, radio brought distance, human organization brought factories and supply chains, computers brought interactivity and sensory awareness and Artificial Intelligence. Did you spot the lie? Artificial Intelligence was always on the horizon, but surprise surprise it was n't as easy to conceptualize'water' as it was to pump water, to design a gear system was harder than cutting one out with a LASER. And do n't let me start on the arguments, the armchair philosophising, the endless bullshit end of the world storytelling. All you need to know here is that the streams of ideas merged with Adam's success, and birthed a mighty and humbling river. The cyberpunks wanted head mounted displays, wearable computing, leading to neural connections and direct brain manipulation. The AI amateurs wanted to build a learning computer, and hope it learned to be nice instead of brutally, genocidally indifferent to human concerns. The AI professionals wanted to conceptualise friendliness as a mathematical construct and then build a machine from that. The SciFi authors wanted to scan a human brain into a computer and run it as a simulation. Adam had other plans. He saw the wearable computers as no more than a tool, forever separate and cognitively distant. The neural implants were too new and simplistic to be useful. The radical mathematicalization of human nature was progressing too slowly, and the brain scan of a person would result in... a person. None of these were the kind of transcendence He dreamed of. The first AI would have the first mover advantage. Lots of people thought so, but it was n't discussed enough to see how severe it would be this time.

Yet, few consider its relevance to the present moment; we are continually at the starting point of future chains of events, and making small but strategic changes can be extraordinarily valuable. Adam foresaw the future and seized his moment, becoming akin to a deity. He oversees us, omnipresent. He supplies nourishment and shelter, heals the sick, and fills the night sky with stars and colors. In doing so, however, he stripped us of our freedom and stifled our autonomy. Before Adam's reign, humans developed technologies as they imagined them: levers and cogs for mechanical advantage, clockwork complexity, brute force from fossil fuels, finesse with electricity, radio for communication over distance, organized factories and supply chains, interactive computers, and the prospect of Artificial Intelligence. Did you catch the deception? Although AI always seemed imminent, it was far harder to conceptually grasp than practical tasks like pumping water or cutting gears with a laser. Not to mention the endless debates, philosophical musings, and apocalyptic storytelling. What truly matters is how streams of ideas converged with Adam's success, creating a formidable and awe-inspiring force. The cyberpunks sought head-mounted displays and wearable tech, leading to neural interfaces and direct brain manipulation. AI enthusiasts aimed to craft a learning computer, hoping it would become benevolent instead of terrifyingly indifferent to human concerns. AI experts tried to mathematically define friendliness and construct a machine from that concept. Sci-fi writers dreamed of scanning a human brain to run as a computer simulation. Adam had a different vision. To him, wearable computers were merely tools, remaining cognitively detached. Neural implants were too rudimentary to be effective. Mathematically understanding human nature was slow, and scanning a brain would result\u2026 in another person. None of these efforts aligned with the transcendence Adam envisioned.

Rather than facing the electric chair, I would be sent back in time. This was a fairly standard punishment for some of the less gruesome murders committed. It addressed a few issues that traditional prisons couldn't solve, first among them being the cost of incarceration. Did you know it costs about $150,000 per year to keep someone locked up? Well, not anymore. Send the prisoner back to the dark ages and you save a lot of money. Secondly, it eliminates the prisoner entirely. Families of victims feel justice is served, knowing the person who killed their loved one is sent to a dangerous historical period. Of course, the era you're exiled to depends on the crime. I expected to be sent to an inhospitable place where death was likely. Yet, I was somewhat looking forward to the experience\u2014some people pay a fortune to travel through time. As I was led from the courtroom, I asked the officer escorting me where I was headed. We\u2019d gotten to know each other well throughout the trial, and I hoped he\u2019d provide some insight. \"Oh now, come on George, you know I can\u2019t tell you that,\" he replied. \"You can tell me, sir, nobody will know it was you,\" I pleaded. \u201cWhere would you like to be sent?\u201d he asked. It was a question I hadn\u2019t really considered. \"How about the Bahamas 10 years ago, with a local woman wearing a coconut bra serving me cocktails on the beach?\" I joked.

Walls were smeared with filth in a mixture of unappealing colors -- brown being the most dominant -- and a horrendous stench of urine, and musk lingered inside the unventilated dining hall of the penitentiary. Horus staggered in traipse, and clasped his unsanitary, food encrusted tray to his chest as a child would a stuffed animal. This was a mistake. He was innocent, of course. But then again, his word had just as much value as any of the inmates here. Horus gawked at the rows upon rows of cantankerous inmates that were huddled like sardines at the wonky, rectangle foldout tables while in queue for his supper. There was something *different* about this place, but he was n't quite sure *what* that difference was. `` Next!'' A hoarse voice croaked from behind the plexiglass sneeze guard. Horus gazed into no mans land as he daydreamed about the nightmarish dreamscape of the cafeteria. `` I said-'' *The short, stubby man wheezed a harsh, hacking cough while phlegm drooled out of his stoma* ``... next!'' And the mesh hair net on his bald, mole infested head fell into the food when he hunched over. `` Ai n't got-'' *wheeze* `` -all day!'' Horus snapped out of his daze, and fumbled to the buffet line in front of him. He fixed his eyes on the chunky, amorphous gloop inside the rusted steel drum. Whatever it was, it was served by the ladle, and flies loved it. `` W... what is it?'' he asked, timid and irresolute. An inmate behind Horus grew impatient, and tapped his foot in restlessness against a sticky spot on the floor -- *shlick, shlick, shlick, shlick* -- then harrumphed when Horus glanced over. The cafeteria server rolled his eyes, and replied, `` It's food,'' before he slopped it onto Horus's tray. He had never been in prison before, and did n't know what to expect. *Was this traditional prison-style food? Is this what they always ate? * He thought to himself. When he exited the line and looked for a place to sit, he gulped his confidence into his empty stomach that grumbled louder than his fearful heartbeats. `` Psst. Hey, *kid! *'' a voice whispered. `` Psst. Over here. Hey!''
