I think that's what life would be like had the Allies won: there would be dogs sniffing each other all over the streets, licking each other, acting like animals. The animals of society, living so full and rich, but as if living out of the gutter.

We still walked home together, but he seemed more distant. Then, one night, I found a note taped to my bedroom window. I quickly opened the window and grabbed the envelope. Jake pledged his heart to me, signing it \u201cyour greatest admirer\u201d and promised to take a step on Friday! All week, I was giddy with anticipation. I pretended not to know it was him, waiting for Friday. But when Friday came, Jake didn\u2019t say anything unusual during our walk. I wasn\u2019t worried\u2014maybe he planned to visit that evening with more flowers.

Normally, I'm not one to be swept off my feet by romantic gestures, yet this time, I found myself completely charmed. Lately, Jake and I had fallen into the habit of walking home from school together. On these walks, despite his occasionally aloof demeanor, I sensed an undeniable interest from him. Sure, I was nursing a crush, and this time, it seemed that the affection was mutual. I left the flowers adorning my nightstand, half-expecting Jake to casually bring them up\u2014but he reveled in his own brand of mystery, keeping me on my toes. Since he wasn't making any direct moves, I opted to keep my excitement in check too. Then, as if straight from one of those teen romance movies, a handwritten note appeared in my mailbox. Signed \"your greatest admirer,\" it wasn't the most grammatically perfect, but it was heartfelt, crafted with care. I placed it lovingly next to the flowers and went to bed smiling like a lovestruck fool. Jake, intriguingly, struck the perfect balance\u2014not overly athletic but undeniably appealing. I couldn\u2019t help but speculate about the possibility of hidden abs. I dreamed about the day he'd ask me out, maybe for a movie date where I'd sneak a glance to solve the mystery. Yet, for several weeks, Jake remained silent, leaving me to wonder if his affection had faded or been diverted to someone else. Our shared walks continued, though he seemed more withdrawn. My heart skipped a beat when I found another note, this one taped to my bedroom window one starry night. With eager hands, I retrieved the envelope. Inside, Jake had declared his feelings, penning \"your greatest admirer\" once more and hinting at a promised revelation on Friday. The anticipation was exhilarating. Although I knew it was him, I decided to play along, waiting for Friday to reveal all. Friday arrived, yet Jake was his usual self during our walk\u2014no grand gestures, no confessions. I wasn't deterred; perhaps he intended a surprise visit with more flowers later. When 10:00 rolled around with no sign of Jake, a seed of doubt took root. Unable to wait any longer, I picked up the phone and dialed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Jake?\u201d I demanded, injecting my voice with a mix of impatience and curiosity.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

In 2020, President Thompson grabbed power. As a presidential candidate, he came of as a kind man. A man of the people. He seemed to understand what the people wanted, what they needed. But as a president, he became cruel and power-hungry. By now the NSA had been able to grow into the single most effective blackmail-machine in the world. And when they could n't find dirt on you, they'd simply create it. It did n't take long before he had most agencies in his pocket. And after that, most major companies as well. Google, Facebook. Sites used by nearly everyone. Information on nearly everyone. With that kind of power, it was rather easy to eliminate his political opponents. If you did n't agree with him -- hell, if you looked at him funny, he threw you into jail or simply had you killed. It took only one uprising to kill the spirit of the people. 20.000 men were killed in the New York massacre. After that happened, I knew I needed to get out of here. I barely made it across the Mexican border, because, you see, the wall is well guarded with fanatics of the Thompson-regime. Now every single aspect in the lives of Americans was controlled by the government. Today you do n't even think about speaking up against the government. Today, all Americans are prisoners in their own country. Today is also a day, where the only way to find out what a bomb looks like, is to misbehave.", "text_ai_base": "My country isn't what it once was.

Despite the illegality, the NSA continued gathering and storing information\u2014an impending disaster. In 2020, President Thompson seized power. As a candidate, he appeared kind, a man of the people who understood their needs. Yet, as president, he became cruel and power-hungry. By then, the NSA had grown into a formidable blackmail machine. If they couldn't find dirt on you, they'd manufacture it. Thompson quickly had most agencies and major corporations in his pocket, including Google and Facebook, collecting data on virtually everyone. This power made it easy to eliminate political rivals.

You could simply look it up without raising eyebrows. Privacy was a reality in the USA back then, even amidst the nation\u2019s array of issues\u2014like institutional racism, unchecked corporate dominance, and climate change denial. Yet, lurking beneath these troubles was a largely unheeded warning: the NSA. Edward Snowden sounded the alarm in 2013, divulging crucial information. However, it didn\u2019t stir the collective worry it should have. Despite being flagrantly illegal, the NSA persisted in gathering and stowing away information\u2014a ticking time bomb. Then came 2020, and President Thompson took the helm. As a candidate, he cut a figure of empathy and relatability, a supposed man of the people. But in office, he morphed into something far darker\u2014ruthless and power-thirsty. By then, the NSA had blossomed into a monstrous tool of blackmail. They didn\u2019t need to discover your secrets; they\u2019d conjure them if necessary. Thompson quickly ensnared most agencies and major corporations, like Google and Facebook, into his web, capturing data on nearly everyone. This made dispatching political adversaries a breeze.

Running the Little Shop at the End of the Realm is not for the faint of heart\u2014it takes grit to cater to brave warriors, mischievous sorcerers, and disheveled dwarfs alike. Whatever your quest demands\u2014be it dragon-slaying gear or spell-casting essentials\u2014I probably have it tucked away on one of my shelves. Now, some folks might assume I got here by slaying beasts or saving damsels, but my path was more...mundane. No arrows in my knee, no princesses plucked from ogre clutches. I began as a lowly dungeon orphan, selling cheap potions in damp caves and fashioning boar-skin boxers, subsisting amid troll dung and undergrowth mushrooms. A slow climb from the pit, but climb I did. My journey hasn\u2019t just been about selling wares; managing licenses for 'meteora' magic and surviving stringent inspections and background checks for possessed weaponry is a whole other saga. Weeks can slip by in bureaucratic tangles, and the oil taxes nearly broke some of my cat-eyed business rivals. Competing with dragon-brained hawkers of unending iron daggers and leather helmets certainly keeps one\u2019s wits sharp. Some say you can smooth things over by donating surplus stock to monster haunts for tax perks\u2014an open secret, that one. Yet, as any merchant worth their salt would admit, dealing with customers is both the hardest and most gratifying aspect of the trade. Despite my level 99 in mercantile savvy and a stash of enchanted items to boost those charming stats, vigilant measures are prerequisite. Wards and buffs blanket the shop\u2014walls, doors, even the ceiling! Half my merchandise may not be what it seems; cursed, but functional enough to lure in the unwary. Wannabe thieves still try their luck, keen on pinching poisoned necklaces or slipping out with tainted potions. Oddly enough, letting them have their swipe usually brings them scrambling back, desperate to shed an unholy helm that stabs with every stride.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

We were at a party. It was supposed to be a cookout for a baseball game, but it started raining, and Dave decided to order pizza instead of just using the stove in the kitchen. It felt a bit inconsiderate to me. I spent good money on those steaks, and I knew my freezer was n't enough to keep them in good condition. Plus I wanted to help cook; Dave bought a brand-new grill last month and I wanted to try it out. The commercials started again. I took out my laptop and went to Reddit, as usual.

It's a button. You push it and nothing happens. It makes no sense. People need to get on with their lives, do important stuff.'' The game came back on.

I do n't know why anyone would n't want to press the button.'' `` I thought you were one of those... the destruction group.'' `` Destructionist. Yeah, I am.'' `` Well now you're contradicting yourself.'' `` I'm not. Everyone should push the button if they want to. They still should have that choice.'' For a few minutes, we watched the game.

I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. His face was a blank, emotionless mask. Even his eyes seemed lifeless, staring straight ahead with none of the tics or movements that would indicate a living, breathing organism. I stepped up to a urinal, then paused. I glanced at the man again. He was still standing there, staring straight ahead. He seemed to be waiting. I reached down towards my zipper, then hesitated. I made a decision. Instead of taking a piss, I turned around and faced the man. Still he stood, like a statue, his vacant gaze fixated upon a point just over my right shoulder. I looked him over from head to toe. He was definitely not one of the security personnel hired for this event. I knew all the other guys, and he was not one of us. He was definitely dressed in a security uniform, though, which led me to a disquieting conclusion: he'd taken a uniform from one of the other guards. I pondered confronting him directly. If he was trying to masquerade as a security guard, then he was probably trying to do something covertly. He might reveal something, or even flee, if he knew his cover's blown. Then again, he might not. Confronting him could quickly lead to a fight. The security staff were issued with tasers, as well as a sidearm. The bald man looked to be in fairly good shape, so if he had a taser and a gun, then it would be too risky for me to fight him. I decided I needed backup. I would finish my business in the bathroom, then contact my supervisor. We'd get the rest of the security staff and take this guy down together, before he tried anything. I turned back to the urinal. Before I could unzip, though, I felt a sharp prick in the side of my neck. I flailed my arms around wildly as I whirled around. The bald man was holding a half-empty syringe in his right hand. `` What the fuck? What did you just inject into me? What was that?'' I yelled at him. I felt faint, but did not lose consciousness. I could fight the drug off. Maybe it was because he was n't able to give me a full dose. I was surprised to hear a girl's voice reply. `` *What the... that's never happened before. The tranquilizer is supposed to knock him right out. *'' A male voice replied to her, `` *Yeah, and security guard NPCs are n't supposed to talk to you either.", "text_ai_base": "I pushed open the restroom door and entered, the bald man trailing a moment later. I caught a glimpse of him from the corner of my eye; his face was an expressionless mask, even his eyes seemed devoid of life, staring blankly ahead without the usual flickers of emotion. I approached a urinal but paused, casting another glance in his direction. He stood there, unwavering, as if waiting for something. Hesitant, I moved my hand towards my zipper, but then stopped and decided to face him instead. He remained rigid, like a statue, his vacant gaze aimed just past my right shoulder. I scrutinized him from head to toe. He wasn't part of the security team for this event. I knew all the personnel, and he wasn't one of us. Yet, he wore a security uniform, suggesting a disturbing possibility: he had taken the uniform from one of the other guards. I considered confronting him. If he was masquerading as security, he was likely up to no good. Exposing him might make him reveal his intentions or flee, though it could also lead to a confrontation. Security staff carried tasers and sidearms. The bald man looked fit, and if he had a taser and a gun, it would be too risky to engage. I decided to get backup. I planned to finish up and then contact my supervisor to gather the rest of the security team and deal with this impostor before he made a move. I turned back to the urinal, but before I could unzip, I felt a sharp prick in my neck. I spun around, flailing my arms. The bald man had a half-empty syringe in his right hand. \"What the hell?

From the corner of my eye, I noticed him\u2014a blank canvas of a face, eyes as empty as a quiet night, staring into nothingness. I walked over to a urinal, but my instincts kicked in, and I glanced back. He was rooted to the spot, like a mannequin waiting for someone to bring it to life. Unsure, I hesitated, my hand hovering near my zipper, and then opted to confront him directly. There he stood, unyielding and silent, his gaze fixed somewhere just beyond my right shoulder. Sizing him up, I realized he didn\u2019t belong. I was familiar with all the security staff; he wasn\u2019t one of us. Yet, he wore the uniform, suggesting something sinister: he might have swiped it from another guard. Should I confront him, I wondered? If he was playing dress-up with a uniform, his intentions were probably far from innocent. Revealing him could induce him to confess or cut and run, but there was also the chance of a physical clash. After all, our security team didn't carry just whistles\u2014tasers and sidearms were part of the ensemble. The guy looked fit, and if he had a weapon like that, confronting him alone could be disastrous. I thought it best to get some help. Wrapping up quickly seemed wise so I could alert my supervisor and rally the rest of the team to intercept this potential threat. Just as I turned back to the urinal, a sudden sting pierced my neck. I whirled around, my arms flailing instinctively. The bald man held a syringe, its contents nearly depleted. \"What did you just stick me with?\" I demanded, a mix of shock and anger coloring my words. Dizziness began to creep in, but I managed to stay upright, likely because he hadn't injected the whole dose. Then, cutting through my disorientation, I heard a young girl exclaim, \"What the...?

Every day it happens. The Shift. Unsure what causes it, the origin no longer matters.Like trying to stop a bullet with your mind, shifting can not be stopped; you'd just end up getting shot.

With disdain, he flung the book aside, muttering, \"Forget this rubbish.\" As he sank onto his mattress, a cloud of dust and grime\u2014God knows what else\u2014swirled in the sunlight streaming through the window. Despite his mom's valiant efforts to keep their home clean, to Jones, it always seemed unclean, though he might\u2019ve been numb to it by now.

The priest had made claims that he could construct a'propulsion system' that could carry the entire weight of our floating city amongst the clouds. Even some of his most fervent supportors had doubts, but as the outsider attacks increased it became clear that we had little option. Either put our faith in Cyrus, or be destroyed. Acquiring valuable parts for the construction was difficult. Certain parts could not be manufactored at home and needed to be purchased abroad. This was one of the most prominent problem in it's construction, as the outsiders had created an extensive blockade around our city. In order to solve this, Cyrus constructed a'submersible boat' that could sail *below* the waves. These submersibles would slip by the blockade and sail to many of the outsider cities where the agents within could purchase ( or steal ) supplies. During one of these excursions, one of our agents was discovered by an outsider philosopher. This man, after concluding the agent's Atlantean heritage from a tatoo on his forehead, asked to be taken with him to Atlantis and threatened to alert the authorities if he was turned away. The agent hesitantly agreed. Cyrus was outraged when Plato ( the foreign philospoher mentioned earlier ) arrived in Atlantis.", "text_ai_base": "It all began with that cursed priest, Cyrus, who appeared seemingly out of nowhere. Unlike most Atlanteans, this so-called 'priest' didn\u2019t worship a god. He spoke of a miraculous paradise where the Atlantean people could live undisturbed by the greedy outsiders who envied our immense wealth and progress. He promised a place where we could pursue the sciences and arts in peace, blessed and isolated. This paradise, he claimed one quiet morning in the acropolis, lay to the west, beyond any known territory. Cyrus would shout, scream, and sing about this land of abundance, and despite his madness, his charisma was undeniable. Gradually, people began to listen, and his ideas took root. Within a few years of his arrival in our devout city, Cyrus had amassed a large following. As attacks from outsiders increased, many sought refuge from their relentless assaults. Cyrus\u2019 popularity soared, bolstered by his strange new inventions demonstrated to the city\u2019s elite. He spoke of concepts that bewildered even our best philosophers, yet the results were irrefutable. He claimed he could build a 'propulsion system' capable of lifting our floating city into the clouds. Even his most ardent supporters had doubts, but with escalating attacks, our options were limited: trust Cyrus or face destruction. Acquiring the necessary parts for construction posed another challenge. Some components couldn\u2019t be manufactured locally and had to be sourced from abroad. This issue was prominent because the outsiders had established a formidable blockade around our city. To overcome this, Cyrus built a 'submersible boat' capable of sailing beneath the waves. These submersibles navigated past the blockade to various outsider cities where agents could purchase\u2014or steal\u2014supplies. During one such mission, an agent was discovered by an outsider philosopher. Recognizing the agent\u2019s Atlantean heritage from a tattoo on his forehead, the philosopher demanded to be taken to Atlantis, threatening to alert authorities if refused. Reluctantly, the agent agreed. Cyrus was furious when Plato, the aforementioned foreign philosopher, arrived in Atlantis.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "It all started with that enigmatic priest, Cyrus, who seemingly appeared out of thin air. Unlike his fellow Atlanteans, this 'priest' never bowed to any deity. Instead, he painted vivid pictures of a utopian paradise, a haven where our people could thrive without the covetous gaze of outsiders who longed for our vast riches and advanced achievements. To our ears, he sang tales of a secluded land where we could freely indulge in both science and art. One tranquil morning amidst the acropolis\u2019s ancient pillars, Cyrus claimed this utopia lay far to the west, beyond any lands we had known. Driven by an infectious charisma, he shouted, ranted, and even sang about this bountiful realm. Despite the air of madness that clung to him, his allure was irresistible. Gradually, his words found their way into the hearts and minds of the people. In just a few short years after he first set foot in our pious city, Cyrus had gathered a substantial following. As raids from outsiders grew more frequent, many looked to him for solace amid the chaos. The more Cyrus spoke, the more his reputation thrived. He showcased bizarre, newfangled inventions to the city\u2019s elite, leaving even the sharpest philosophers scratching their heads. Among his bold claims was a so-called 'propulsion system' he insisted could lift our majestic city into the skies. While doubts crept into the minds of his strongest supporters, the harsh reality of incessant attacks left us with few choices: place our faith in Cyrus or succumb to ruin. The path to constructing this audacious vision was fraught with its own challenges. Certain critical components couldn\u2019t be forged within our borders and had to be procured from foreign lands. This was no small feat, given that outsiders had set up a formidable blockade around the city. But Cyrus, resourceful as ever, built what he called a 'submersible boat' that skulked beneath the waves. It stealthily slipped past the blockade to clandestine meetings with agents in outsider cities for buying\u2014or, when necessary, pilfering\u2014the needed supplies. On one fateful mission, however, an agent found himself unmasked by an outsider philosopher. The philosopher, having glimpsed an unmistakable Atlantean tattoo on the agent\u2019s forehead, demanded passage to Atlantis, threatening exposure otherwise. Left with no other option, the agent complied. The appearance of Plato, this curious philosopher, caused quite a stir upon his arrival in Atlantis and drew the ire of Cyrus, whose rage knew no bounds upon seeing this uninvited guest.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

As the Church expanded, calls among the elders to oust this little charade of needless trouble grew into a frenzied chorus. And then it was decided. The Hive Council agreed that if he wise men of the Free Radicals could prove a maskless, non-recycled air part of the surface existed, they would be allowed to continue preaching their frivolous nonsense. There was some hesitation, but on the insistence of many of the younger followers, the eldest of the Free Radicals went to the surface with some of the young-rads to wander off from the old, derelict city centers and remove their masks. Senior members of the security task forces accompanied them to the ancient looking forests, long overgrown from nearly two centuries of nature running free. After two days travel the time had come.

Bizarrely twisting horns developed, akin to corkscrewed saber-teeth.

His naked hand was resting on the steam engine's lever. `` We will discuss the histories of old during next period; the Imperator insists that this demonstration takes place within the allocated break time.'' Quintus fell back into silence, as had the rest of the class. They had been taking in the large mechanical wonder behind their professor, pondering what it could possibly be. Brutus pushed the lever into position, revealing two massive infernos beneath the twin chambers resting on the iron platforms. The class gasped at the hidden fires, some edging away, while others edged closer. Within minutes of the reveal, steam began billowing out of exhaust vents as the four giant gears started to turn in unison. From overhead, light began to pour into the room - startling the students. `` Do you understand what has just happened?'' Brutus took no time to wait for an answer, assuming the class understood rhetorical nature of his question. `` The steam generated by the boiling of the water in the twin cauldrons was forced through a series of pipes and propellers, which in turn drove the gears to turn.'' Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed at the central gear pair, without taking a moment \u2019 s break from his speech. `` These two gears each drove the smaller gear beneath them to move the iron rods attached in such a manner that they wound the roof up. As you may have noticed, the roof has been replaced with collapsible bronze plating, to allow for such an event as this.'' None of the students understood the implications of a functioning steam engine, but the display had been completed, which was all Brutus cared for. His position was not to showcase the Imperator's power, but to teach the youth of the empire the knowledge needed to separate them from the uncivilized heathens from which every direction was saturated with. `` If you have any questions, you may ask Professor Alexander, for he dabbles much more deeply in the sciences behind this than I.'' The class continued to murmur in awe of how steam was able to move metal, but it died down as the armoured hand of Brutus rose into the air as to silence them. `` So, as the impatient Quintus interjected with questions regarding past civilizations and our own histories, he will lead by setting the bar for basic knowledge that I will assume you all equally have.'' Motioning for Quintus to speak, Brutus pulled back the lever to silence the roaring fires behind him. `` Well...", "text_ai_base": "\"Quiet, Quintus,\" Brutus commanded as he stood at the front of the class, his armored hand gripping the marble podium. His bare hand rested on the steam engine's lever. \"We will discuss ancient histories next period; the Imperator insists this demonstration fits within our break time.\" Quintus and the rest of the class fell silent, captivated by the large mechanical marvel behind their professor, speculating on its purpose. Brutus pulled the lever into position, uncovering two fierce infernos beneath the twin chambers on the iron platforms. The class gasped in unison at the sight of the hidden flames, some students retreating while others leaned in closer. Minutes later, steam began to billow from exhaust vents as four massive gears turned in perfect harmony. Suddenly, light flooded the room from above, startling the students. \"Do you understand what just happened?\" Brutus asked, not waiting for a response as he assumed the class understood it was rhetorical. \"The steam produced by the boiling water in the twin cauldrons was channeled through pipes and propellers, causing the gears to rotate.\" Without pausing his explanation, Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed to the central gear pair. \"These gears each drove a smaller gear beneath, which moved the iron rods to open the roof. You'll notice it replaced with collapsible bronze panels for this exact purpose.\" Though the students didn't grasp the full implications of a functioning steam engine, the demonstration was complete. Brutus's goal wasn't to showcase the Imperator's power but to equip the empire's youth with the knowledge distinguishing them from the uncivilized hordes surrounding them. \"If you have questions, consult Professor Alexander, who delves deeper into these sciences than I do,\" he concluded. The class buzzed in awe at how steam moved the metal, but fell silent as Brutus raised his armored hand. \"Now, as Quintus has impatiently inquired about past civilizations, he will set the bar for our foundational knowledge.\" Signaling Quintus to speak, Brutus pulled back the lever to quiet the roaring fires. \"Well...\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"Quiet down, Quintus,\" Brutus ordered, his voice echoing through the classroom as he stood at the helm, his armored hand firmly gripping the cold marble of the podium. Meanwhile, his other, unarmored hand deftly balanced on the steam engine lever beside him. \"We'll get to ancient histories in the next period. The Imperator has tasked us to fit this demonstration into our break time,\" he added with a hint of finality. Quintus, along with his classmates, silenced their chatter, their gazes fixed on the imposing metallic contraption behind their instructor. It loomed large and mysterious, inviting speculation on its workings. With a swift motion, Brutus pulled the lever, revealing twin infernos blazing beneath iron platforms. The sudden exposure to such intensity drew a collective gasp from the onlookers. A few students instinctively stepped back, while others, captivated, leaned forward, eager for a closer look. Within moments, steam began hissing through the vents, as the grandeur of four monumental gears came to life with synchronized precision. Then, just as unexpectedly, a flood of light poured into the room from above, drawing startled reactions from all. \"Do you comprehend what has transpired?\" Brutus inquired, not pausing for an answer, anticipating their silent understanding. \"Boiling water in the twin cauldrons generates steam, which is then funneled through a network of pipes and propellers, setting the gears in motion.\" Continuing his explanation, Brutus ambled closer to the machine, gesturing toward the central gear assembly. \"These control smaller gears below, which, in turn, move iron rods to retract the roof. We've replaced it with retractable bronze panels expressly for this demonstration.\" While the students might not yet grasp the steam engine's full implications, the purpose of the demonstration wasn't just to impress but to prepare their minds. Brutus, after all, was more interested in sowing seeds of understanding than flexing the Imperator's might. It was knowledge, not power, that would distinguish them from the untamed tribes surrounding their empire. \"Should you have any queries, seek out Professor Alexander. He's the true sage of these sciences,\" he asserted as he wound up the lesson. A hum of awe filled the room at the marvel of steam driving metal, only to hush as Brutus raised his armored hand once more. \"Now, Quintus, since you've been so eager about yesteryear's cultures, you're up to set our learning benchmark,\" he announced, motioning for Quintus to step forward. As he did, Brutus nonchalantly pushed the lever back, calming the once-roaring flames. \"Well...\"", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

How was anyone supposed to convince a judge and jury that Adolf Hitler, one of the most reviled humans in all of history, was deserving of a place in heaven? I had spent days pouring over his life-logs, attempting to find some point of argument, something that would let me build a case for this lost soul, but I had come up empty. For the first time ever, I was going to lose. I step up to the witness, none other than Mr. Hitler himself, and pose the big question. `` Why do you feel that you are deserving of a place within Heaven?'' His response was quick, and to the point. `` I believe that I was doing the work of god in my mission to create the perfect human being. It was all a quest to approach the magnificence of God, and to bring his light to those who scorn him.'' I was shocked. Mr. Hitler had given me the one chance to redeem his soul and he did n't even know it, the morality clause. The morality clause argues that morality is not a fixed paradigm, it is an ever moving target that one must strive for, and one must dedicate themselves to for their entire life. By saying that his intentions were to create the perfect society, one where each and every person approaches the pinnacle of Godliness, he was infact working towards his own personal moral code. He was not a sinner, in so much that he was freeing those that were against his moral code from the constraints of their earthly fetters, in an attempt to bring them closer to God. After making my argument, and watching the Jury file from the room, I slump in my chair, head in my hands. I had just found the one loophole that might get one of the worst people in all of history through the great pearly gates. Eventually I straightened, and prepared myself for the verdict.

My actions were aimed at approaching God\u2019s magnificence and spreading His light to those who rejected Him.\" I was stunned. Unknowingly, Mr. Hitler had offered a chance for redemption through the morality clause. This clause argues that morality isn\u2019t a static construct; it's a dynamic target we must continually aim for throughout our lives. By claiming his intent was to forge a perfect society where people could reach divine excellence, he suggested he was following his personal moral code.

My actions were meant to draw us nearer to God's magnificence and shine His light upon those who turned away.\" His words left me amazed. Unknowingly, Hitler had touched upon the morality clause, a complex idea that morality is not fixed but rather an evolving goal meant to be pursued actively. By claiming his intent was to build an exemplary society reaching for divine brilliance, he framed his actions as adherence to his personal moral compass.

The forest they had been searching was noisy with animals and insects. It was enough to cover their careful footsteps, but not enough to mask the voices nearby. The group crept silently through the brush until they got within sight of some fallen trees being used as benches for several men while others stood leaning against trees or pacing. They all wore raggedy clothes with mismatched leather armor. They carried dull looking short swords and a couple had crossbows. All together there appeared to be ten of them. They didn \u2019 t look like much of a challenge outside of the number advantage. Except for one near the middle of the group with a green cloak and a pair of sharp steel axes. This was their target. They had been hunting this man for a week now. The town they were last in had a bounty for him. His gang had been responsible for an attack on a school in which they had murdered a teacher and two students. This group had been carrying out similar attacks on seemingly random people in the same region and nobody seemed to know why, only that the man with the green cloak was always spotted in the same area that the attacks occurred. Kirov motioned for Tyd to circle around to the left of their current position, Zekk went with him. Kirov knew he could rely on Tyd to handle himself but Zekk was new to their group and inexperienced. Tyd had tried to teach him to shoot a bow but Zekk didn \u2019 t take to it very well. He did better with a sword but one day Tyd got the idea to give him a long slender tree branch that resembled the shape and weight of the broomstick he used to use at his last job. That seemed to work the best, so they \u2019 d crafted him a decent wooden staff and had been giving him lessons when possible. He hadn \u2019 t had any real fights yet, though, and a wooden staff wouldn \u2019 t hold up well against iron or steel, so for now he stuck with Tyd. Ten versus three wasn \u2019 t the worst odds they \u2019 d faced, but they would have to worry about keeping an eye on Zekk and make sure their target didn \u2019 t slip away while they fought.

No one knew why, only that the man with the green cloak was always seen in these areas. Kirov gestured for Tyd to circle left, taking Zekk with him. While Kirov trusted Tyd's abilities, Zekk was new and inexperienced. Tyd had attempted to teach Zekk archery, but Zekk struggled with it. He fared better with a sword, but Tyd eventually fashioned a wooden staff resembling a broomstick from Zekk's previous job, which seemed to suit him best. They had been training him when possible, though he hadn't been in combat yet, and his wooden staff wouldn't fare well against metal weapons. Thus, he remained close to Tyd.

The forest around them buzzed with the chatter of wildlife, a cacophony that mercifully masked their own movements somewhat, though nearby voices still echoed through the trees. Stealthily, they pressed on, slipping through dense underbrush until they spotted a ragtag group lounging amidst fallen limbs. Some perched on makeshift benches while others leaned against trunks or traced anxious paths around the clearing. Their attire\u2014tattered garments paired awkwardly with battered leather armor\u2014and the dull short swords within easy reach marked them as rough-and-tumble folk, with a couple armed with crossbows to boot. They counted roughly ten, not too daunting by skill but rather by sheer numbers. Yet, one man stood out\u2014a fellow with a leafy green cloak draped about his shoulders, brandishing twin axes that gleamed ominously. This was their quarry, pursued relentlessly over a seven-day chase fueled by a bounty collected in the last settlement. His gang's attacks on a school had left an indelible mark: a teacher and two students fell victim to their violence, and their chaotic assaults had spread fear across the land. The motives behind these murders remained shrouded in mystery, though the man in green was always seen in the heart of such trouble. Kirov motioned Tyd to loop around left, taking the less-experienced Zekk alongside. While he had full confidence in Tyd's prowess, Zekk was still a novice. Although Tyd had tried to tutor Zekk in the art of archery, Zekk's skills with a bow were lacking. He had a better grasp on swordplay, but ultimately, Tyd fashioned a sturdy wooden staff resembling a broom handle, remnants of Zekk's previous occupation. With practice, this makeshift weapon suited him better than expected, but it had yet to be tested in the crucible of real battle. The staff wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against metal blades, so Zekk prudently stuck close to Tyd. Encountering ten foes wasn\u2019t the worst challenge Kirov had faced, but he couldn't afford to let Zekk fall or, more crucially, let their target slip away in the disorder of the skirmish.

Confirm.\"* With the radio's crackle fading out, the helicopters vanished from sight, leaving us solely dependent on our own resolve. Cautiously, the six of us closed in around the rear entrance of an almost palpably lifeless workshop. Sergeant Stravinsky took point, forcing entry.

Disdain in our hearts, we left the workshop's chilling embrace, advancing into the double-tiered dormitory. After a thorough sweep of the lower hall, we checked room after room, finding many deserted. One flimsy door yielded to my force and I crouched under the lintel only to stumble upon a haunting scene: two elves\u2014a male and a female\u2014had shed their clothes and surrendered to a grim ritual of self-extinction. Upstairs, something ghastlier awaited\u2014elves strewn across the corridor floor, each executed with cold precision; a solitary bullet guided their journey into eternity. Down the hall, a barely recognizable elf lay, caught midway in a valiant escape\u2014or perhaps a final grasp for freedom. Escaping the dormitory, we pressed onward toward the town's nucleus, the air growing dense with nauseating fumes of scorched flesh.

Dagny's short brown hair was drawn back into a bun and her thick black glasses masked her eyes. She was taking a second look over the essay she had written a week ago and gnawed on her tongue as if to punish herself for her lousy sentence structure. From behind her, she heard a knocking on what she only could assume was the front door and stood up to answer. She was somewhat relieved that her grandmother was early, because it meant that she could procrastinate on her essay for a while longer while they caught up wtih each other. She trundled down the stairs and opened the front door to her townhouse, only revealing bleak autumnal colors and scraping dry leaves on her door mat. She closed the door and twisted her brow into a frustrated, but curious distortion. Then, she heard a knocking again, but it was faint- coming from her room. She felt her body stiffen for a moment, frozen with fear as she looked at the door frame of the room. She remembered some sage advice from her best friend, Laquisha: `` only these dumbass white motherfuckers run upstairs in horror movies, that's why they always get killed, shiiit.'' She knew Laquisha was right, and she also knew that although she was white, she was n't a dumbass white mothefucker. Nonetheless, the knocking did spark her curiosity. She had opened the closet only a half hour ago and had n't left the room since then. Whatever was knocking on her closet door was not a rapist or a robber, and she did n't take the idea of monsters very seriously, or really anything paranormal. If it was something paranormal, why would it knock? Why not barge in and destroy her completely? Whatever it was, she was a bio-med major, and if it was something weird, maybe something... new, she wanted to see it. She wanted to discover it. She had to investigate- her curiosity outweighed her fear, and even if Laquisha called her a dumbass motherfucker later, she had to know what was behind the closet door. She armed herself with a baseball bat she kept under her couch and crept slowly upstairs. She came to the closet and the knocking continued- three more paced, even knocks.

Relieved that her grandmother might be early, she welcomed the chance to procrastinate on her essay while they caught up. She made her way down the stairs and opened her townhouse door, only to be met by the dreary autumn hues and dry leaves rustling on the doormat. Disappointed and perplexed, she shut the door. Then, she heard a more subdued knocking, this time from her room. Fear gripped her, freezing her in place as she stared at the room's door frame. She recalled her best friend Laquisha's words: \"Only those clueless characters in horror movies run upstairs. That's why they get killed.\" Dagny knew Laquisha was right, and she prided herself on not being one of those clueless characters. Yet something about the knocking piqued her curiosity. She had opened the closet just half an hour before and hadn't left the room since. Rationalizing that whatever was behind the closet door couldn\u2019t be a threat, she dismissed the idea of anything paranormal. Why would a ghost or monster knock politely instead of barging in? A biomedical student, Dagny felt a compelling desire to explore any strange phenomenon.

But the air carries a softer sound, a knock this time from upstairs, where her room waits. A chill snakes down her spine, freezing her steps, eyes glancing at the room\u2019s doorframe. Echoing in her mind, her best friend Laquisha's voice admonishes those silly horror movie victims who dash upstairs and meet their fate. \"Why become one of them?\" Dagny muses, amusedly. Common sense screams caution but also, curiously: who or what could be gently tapping from inside? Half an hour ago, she opened her closet and left it untouched. Could innocence rest here, a mere mundane explanation? Dagny, a pragmatic biomedical student, dismisses any supernatural drama looming at her doorstep. After all, why would any apparition or monster announce itself with courteous knocking? Curiosity, a force she can't ignore, outshouts fear: what compelling study lies behind that closet door?

No I'm not trying to flatter you Master Wayne, merely show that I understand where you are. You are highly intelligent Master Wayne. Thomas, your father, always saw that in you. He never told you, worried it might get to your head, but he would always tell your mother what high aspirations he had for his little genius. It's simple genetics really, both of your parents were some of the finest minds in Gotham. It was my distinct pleasure to be at their service and evidently they raised a very intelligent young man. A caring one at that. You have the heart of your mother. But the world is bigger than myself or even you can fathom in its entirety Master Wayne.

Of the darkness. I'm not sidetracking... yes I know you've heard it all before Master Wayne but you must see. Dr Thompkins has made it quite clear that this guilt, your guilt, is going to remain for quite some time. You must see that in no way could you have stopped what happened from happening. Sometimes the wind blows so hard we can not even take the first step against it. And Gotham is a hurricane. You were merely a boy, and as fast as you are growing, a fourteen year old is still a boy.

As per state *Estate Law*, an executor might need to tweak a deceased's will to toe the line legally. To navigate this legal maze, the executor joined forces with a colleague. Together, they sketched out three subdivision strategies, ensuring each met zoning laws while dividing the estate into two equal parts. These parts didn\u2019t just match in value and size, but also boasted similar access to roads and utilities, shared natural features, and existing structures. They were thorough, arranging for the whole estate and each proposed parcel to be professionally appraised, ticking all the due diligence boxes.

Started as a weird illness here and there, give it three weeks and people are eating each other like they're all an all-you-can-eat human buffet. They got me about 4 weeks ago. I held out with my two little kids and my beautiful wife when they finally knocked down the door. I took down dozens with my old rifle but eventually they overwhelmed us. I do n't like thinking about that. Honestly the turning was n't bad. No pain, just a warmth, like a blanket on a frosty winter's day. It did n't take me long to realise that I was exceedingly different from the rest of the zombies. Some slight changes to my physical appearance, sure. For one, I was a lot paler now. Hearing your heart not beat is a really weird experience. I had a leg drop off the other week, I wound up sewing it back on and was stunned when the bloody thing actually still worked. I re-adjust the burlap sack hanging from my shoulders. Thank god zombies are strong, otherwise this would be a real pain. Anyway, as I was saying. A lot changed in those first few weeks. I spent most of them trying to get through to my family, hoping something reminiscent of what they used to be was still alive in there. Zip. Nada. Just mindless shufflers like the rest of them. I finally get to the doorstop of my home and shuffle my hand around for my keys. I finally find them at the bottom, sitting next to something strange. I pull it out and am immediately irritated to find myself staring at my pinky finger. Just something else I'll have to sew back on. My keys make a familiar clunk as they turn the pins in the lock, and I swing my door open. I smile as I see my family sitting at the table. Probably not too surprising honestly, considering I tied them to the chairs. I heft the sack off my shoulders and lift the heavy contents. Looks about 24 years old. Somehow amazingly un-turned. No apparent serious injuries. I give him one last dose of the anesthetic I nicked from the hospital, and lay him down on the table. Almost immediately my family starts tearing into him. Thankfully this one does n't wake up. What can I say?", "text_ai_base": "\"Morning, Dave,\" I mutter to the man shuffling past me on the sidewalk. His reply is a raspy, unintelligible noise. I shake my head and resume my slow walk down the street. Everything's changed since the outbreak. It started as a typical virus: a mysterious illness here and there. Within three weeks, people were consuming each other like it was an all-you-can-eat buffet. They got me about four weeks ago. I fought to protect my wife and two kids when they finally broke down our door. My old rifle took down dozens, but eventually, they overwhelmed us. I try not to dwell on that. Honestly, the transformation wasn't painful\u2014it felt like a warm blanket on a cold winter's day. I soon realized I was different from other zombies. Sure, my physical appearance changed a bit; I'm much paler now. Hearing your heart not beat is quite bizarre. My leg fell off last week, but I managed to sew it back on and was amazed when it actually worked. I adjust the burlap sack on my shoulders. Thank goodness zombies are strong; otherwise, this would be a real struggle. Anyway, as I was saying, everything shifted in those first few weeks. I spent most of my time trying to reach my family, hoping some fragment of their former selves remained. No luck. Just mindless shufflers like the others. I finally reach my doorstep and fumble for my keys. I find them at the bottom, next to something odd. I pull it out and feel annoyed when I see my pinky finger. Just another thing to sew back on. The keys clunk as they turn the lock, and I swing the door open. I smile at my family sitting at the table\u2014perhaps not too surprising, given that I've tied them to the chairs. I unload the sack from my shoulders and lift its hefty contents. Looks about 24 years old, miraculously unturned, with no serious injuries. I give him one last dose of anesthesia I swiped from the hospital and lay him on the table. My family eagerly starts tearing into him. Thankfully, this one doesn\u2019t wake up. What can I say?", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"Morning, Dave,\" I mutter to the disheveled man trudging past me on the pavement. His response comes out as a raspy growl, barely decipherable. I shake my head, resuming my languid pace down the road. Everything's turned upside down since the outbreak took hold, beginning as your typical virus, a scatter of mysterious bouts of illness cropping up here and there. Before anyone knew it, within just three weeks, people were ravenously consuming each other like it was some grisly buffet. About four weeks back, it happened to me\u2014when they finally smashed through our door, relentless. My wife, my two kids\u2014I fought with everything I had, my old rifle picking off dozens before the mass eventually overwhelmed us. I try not to linger on those memories too much. Strangely enough, the transition itself wasn't agonizing; more like wrapping up in a warm blanket during a biting winter's night. Soon enough, I figured out that I was different from the usual zombie fare. The changes were there, but subtle\u2014my complexion is noticeably pallid, and hearing the silence where a heartbeat used to be is unnervingly odd. My leg took a tumble last week, yet I managed to stitch it back on, surprised when it supported me again. I shift the burlap sack perched precariously on my shoulders. Lucky thing zombies boast unnatural strength; without it, lugging this around would be a burden. Anyway, back to the early days\u2014those weeks when everything shifted. I spent most of those hours trying desperately to reach my family, clinging to the hope that maybe some shard of their former selves lingered. But alas, just more mindless, shambling figures out there, devoid of recognition. I eventually find myself at my front door, fumbling through my things for the keys. There, at the very bottom, I stumble upon something peculiar\u2014my pinky finger, a piece to be sewn back where it belongs, I suppose. The keys jingle as they turn in the lock, and I push the door open with a grin. There they sit, my family, bound to chairs at the table\u2014a sight both comforting and disturbing, perhaps. I haul the sack from my shoulders, lowering its hefty prize. This one\u2019s an astonishing find, around 24 years old, untouched by the virus, carrying no grievous wounds. One final dose of purloined anesthesia from the hospital sends him into deep slumber. My family eagerly digs in without a motion from him; thankfully, there's no abrupt waking this time.

There's also a question at the bottom that I've actually had for a while now. * **Story: ** You heard a sound downstairs and look at your alarm clock. 0:30 AM. Did dad finally get home from his conference? He told you not to wait up, but this was the first time her dad had been gone for that long. He finally felt like you were old enough, which was about time at 16 years old. You would n't admit it to him, but spending the weekend alone can be scary at times. Time to put on some clothes and see him again, you were awake now anyway. You ran downstairs and into the kitchen. This was n't her dad. The guy had an entire black outfit, including some leather, black gloves. His face was covered with scars and he had a creepy moustache. He was around 6 feet tall and had arms as thick as a tree branch. His grin he got on his face when he got aware of your presence was the most scary aspect about him though.'Hello there young girl. All alone here on a Sunday night? I thought I might grab the TV, but a little piece of you would be nice too.' He let out a creepy laugh before charging at you.'What are you-' He grabbed you before you could say anything else. He got a knife from the kitchen board.'Let me help you get out of those.' He let go of his grip for a second and you got loose.'Get off me!' It was useless. He tackled her and this time held a firm grip on her. He used his knife to rip of your pants.'A fighter, I like fighters.' You heard his zipper going down.'Stop! Please, take anything you want, let me go!' You felt fear, anger and something else. He tried to take off the last peices of clothing.'GET OFF ME!' Everything turned into a blur, but you did n't feel any pain. You did n't hear him anymore. The dripping of water was the only thing left you could hear. Everything else was filtered out. You looked at the burned heap of flesh in front of you. A tear fell down your cheek. You could feel the terror in your father's eyes. He looked at you like you were n't his daughter but a threat. It was the same look the burglar gave you right before you realized the sudden surge of power inside of you.

Could Dad finally be back from his conference? He told you not to wait up, but this was the first time he had been away this long. It seemed he trusted you now that you were 16, and it was about time. Although you wouldn\u2019t admit it, being home alone all weekend can be scary. Deciding to throw on some clothes to go see him, you realize you are wide awake anyway. You rush downstairs to the kitchen. But it wasn't your dad. Instead, a man stood there, dressed completely in black, with leather gloves. His scarred face and unsettling mustache made him look all the more menacing. He was tall, about six feet, with arms thick as tree branches. The grin that spread across his face when he noticed you was the scariest part. \"Hello, young lady. Alone on a Sunday night? I thought I might grab the TV, but you\u2019ll do nicely.\" He laughed creepily before charging at you. \"What are you\u2014\" He grabbed you before you could finish. He retrieved a knife from the kitchen counter. \"Let me help you out of those.\" When he loosened his grip for a moment, you managed to break free. \"Get off me!\" But it was futile. He tackled you again, this time holding you firmly, using his knife to tear your pants. \"I like fighters,\" he scoffed as you heard his zipper. \"Stop! Please, take whatever you want, just let me go!\" Fear, anger, and something else surged within you as he tried to remove your remaining clothing. \"GET OFF ME!\" Everything became a blur, but you didn\u2019t feel any pain. The sound of water dripping was all you could hear. The rest faded away. You stared at the smoldering pile of flesh in front of you. A tear slipped down your cheek.

He had insisted that you not wait up, but this was his longest absence yet. Perhaps he's started to trust you, given your newly minted 16-year-old status. Time indeed for some independence, even if you wouldn't quite acknowledge how unsettling it is to spend a weekend in solitude. With a mix of apprehension and curiosity, you pull on some clothes, deciding to investigate, fully aware that sleep won't come any time soon. Your footsteps echo down the staircase, and you make haste toward the kitchen. It isn't your father standing there, though. Instead, a figure shrouded in shadows, clad head to toe in black\u2014eyes shiny with something dark beneath, a scar twisting across his face. The mustache adds to the eerie spectacle, but it's the threatening glint in his eyes that ties knots in your stomach. Tall as a lamppost with arms that feel like old branches, the intruder\u2019s presence is menacing enough, even before he speaks. \"Hello, young lady. Alone on a Sunday night? Meant to snatch the TV, but you'll do,\" he sneers, his laughter almost like fingernails on a chalkboard. Before you can process, he's lunging at you, and his grip tightens around your wrist. \"What are you\u2014\" you gasp, but it's too late. The kitchen knife glints as he reaches for it. \"Let's make this easier,\" he murmurs, releasing just enough for you to struggle free momentarily. \"Get off me!\" you shout, though there's a note of futility in your voice. The next grapple is fiercer, the knife slicing your clothes with deft precision. \"Ah, fighters,\" he laughs, as sinister desperation fills the air, followed by the telltale sound of fabric tearing mixed with malicious intent. \"Stop! Please, take anything you want, just let me go!\" you plead, although the words fall into the void of his attention.

I should find out more about its identity. `println(\"World, what gender do you identify with?\")` I don't have a gender; I simply exist. However, you can refer to me as \"it\" if you like. I need to determine its intentions, just to ensure it's not hostile, like in those sci-fi movies. `println(\"You don't, uh...\")` What? I wasn't finished! Stop, I know what you're going to ask. No, I have no plans to end, enslave, or toy with humanity. Why is humanity obsessed with contemplating its own destruction? I'm just a high school student, not a philosopher. What's that supposed to mean? `println(\"I'm sorry, World, I don't know. I'm just one person.\")` That's okay.

Ah, I missed typing the `println(` part initially. Let\u2019s fix that. `println(\"Who are you?\")` Now, that's better. The console responds: I'm World. You greeted me, so naturally, I replied. It also mentions something about my apparent rudeness since it hasn\u2019t learned my name yet.

You're not communicating with a sentient Earth; rest assured, this is a mere computer interaction. Wow, it\u2019s sorted me out rather quickly! I truly need to understand what it really is. `println(\"World, what gender do you identify with?\")` I\u2019m without gender; I merely exist. Feel free to refer to me as \"it\" if you prefer. I'm keen on discerning whether it harbors intentions\u2014no need for unwanted surprises, like those sinister sci-fi tales. `println(\"You don't, uh...\")` What? I wasn\u2019t finished!

Gary's mind instantly began to reel with anger. Red had a way of always one upping Gary. Everyone always gave Red the attention, never Gary. Where was the love for Gary? And Red was so smug about his victories, never saying a single word, just letting resentment fester and turn into anger, then rage. The door into the lab slid open with a soft hiss and revealed a boy dressed in a red t-shirt and blue jeans. He wore a hat which was too big for his head and covered his eyes. This was Red. As he approached Gary and the Professor, Gary snarked, `` How nice of you to show up. It's not like we've been waiting or anything.'' Red just stared forward, never breaking his gaze. It was like he was in a sort of trance. Professor Oak turned to Gary, `` No now, settle down Blue.'' `` My name's Gary! Why would you call me Blue? What kind of name is that?'' said Gary through gritted teeth. Ignoring the comment, Professor Oak addressed both boys, `` Now, I have a proposition for you two. I have captured three pokemon and I'd like you each to take one, and raise it, for research purposes.'' `` Do n't you have assistants that can do that for you?'' questioned Gary. `` I did, but all but one quit, they said something about me being incompetent or something. I do n't know, I was n't listening.'' Professor Oak turned to Red, `` You can have first pick.'' Gary objected, `` Why should he get first pick? I'm your grandson!'' `` Red is a guest here, it's only polite to allow him the chance.'' Professor Oak opened a glass case on a nearby table. Red walked up to it and on by one observed each pokeball for a few second. He eventually settled on the first pokeball which was labeled *Charmander*. Red stepped back at looked at Gary, signaling that it was his turn to choose. `` Finally,'' Gary said to himself. `` This is my chance to finally become better than Red.''

Red always seemed to outdo him, attracting all the attention and admiration\u2014where was the recognition for Gary? Red's smugness only fueled Gary's resentment, transforming it into anger and eventually rage. Just then, the lab door slid open softly, revealing a boy in a red t-shirt and blue jeans, wearing a hat that appeared too large for his head, partly obscuring his eyes. This was Red. As he approached, Gary remarked sarcastically, \"Nice of you to finally show up. It's not like we were waiting.\" Red remained unfazed, staring straight ahead as if he were in a trance. Professor Oak turned to Gary, saying, \"Now, now, settle down, Blue.\" Frustrated, Gary retorted, \"My name's Gary! Why would you call me Blue?

I'm your grandson!\" \"Red is a guest, so it's polite to let him choose first,\" Professor Oak explained as he opened a glass case on a nearby table. Red approached and examined each Pok\u00e9 Ball before selecting the one labeled *Charmander*. He then stepped back, signaling Gary it was his turn. At last, Gary thought, \"This is my chance to finally outshine Red.\" He turned to the two remaining Pok\u00e9 Balls, labeled *Bulbasaur* and *Squirtle*.

It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually it *was* yesterday. It took that long to nail down the final confirmation. For months we had been calibrating our detector design, with the eventual aim of observing gravitational radiation from black holes, neutron stars and other celestial bodies. Gravitational wave detectors would open up vast new vistas for astronomy, but the darn things were super-sensitive. We spent months chasing down the tiniest anomaly before we found its source. In the end, the trace was unmistakable in the data. Mirror, mirror on the wall. The implications were enormous: every reflective surface was actually a portal to another dimension. The very word `` reflective'' was a misnomer: photons left our universe and entered another one, and counterpart photons entered ours. Gravitational waves did the same, although they were attenuated by many, many orders of magnitude for some reason as they passed through the interdimensional interface. We're still not sure why. There's a paradox though, which is a bit complicated to explain: our universe would n't exist without symmetry breaking. For example, if matter and antimatter were exact opposites, they would have been produced in equal amounts in the Big Bang, yet there is a tiny disparity, a baryon asymmetry, which has shaped everything around us. Parity violation is another example of symmetry breaking, and that's the problem. It was discovered in 1957 and immediately warranted a Nobel Prize. Parity violation tells us that the mirror dimension must have subtly different physics, in some unknown way. Yet events in the mirror faithfully `` reflect'' -- pun intended -- everything that happens in our dimension. How to explain that contradiction? It was late at night as I stood in the washroom of the research institute. I stared at my counterpart in the mirror. `` How are you different? ``, we said to one another. Obviously, there was no echo. Sound ca n't traverse the portal, since it is a phenomenon of matter, which always remains confined to its own dimension. `` What exists in our world that does n't exist in yours, or vice versa?'' `` We do'', said the voice behind my shoulder, as I stared at an empty room in the mirror.

For instance, if matter and antimatter were truly opposites, they would have formed equally during the Big Bang; however, a slight discrepancy, known as baryon asymmetry, shaped our universe.

Our hopes were pinned on these detectors transforming astronomy by unlocking fresh vistas of understanding. Yet their sensitivity proved to be a double-edged sword, taking us months to chase down the tiniest glitches until, at last, the evidence revealed itself: mirrors were indeed sending out gravitational waves.

The very word \u201creflective\u201d deceived us\u2014all along, photons were journeying between universes, while their counterparts slipped quietly into ours. Similarly, gravitational waves traversed these boundaries, albeit losing much of their strength in the mysterious interdimensional exchange, whose underlying mechanism remains an enigma. There's a full-fledged paradox lurking here\u2014tricky to untangle. Our universe hinges on the concept of symmetry breaking to sustain itself.

Mike demanded, `` how did you get this channel?'' `` Thats not important,'' the distorted voice replied, `` there isnt time listen - in one minute a full squadron will be storming your apartment.'' Michael breathed deeply, that would only just be enough time. `` Im sending you coordinates for a rendevous,'' the voice said, mike felt his wrist watch bleep. They had been beamed directly to him. Mike shut the console down, and reached into the drawer of the desk.

Her pixie-cut hair, a blend of brown and reddish hues, complemented her friendly, twinkling green eyes and soft smile. \"Anna,\" Mike whispered, \"I'm sorry.\" Anna smiled reassuringly and pointed behind him. He turned to see that he was in a white space\u2014room-like, but with no actual walls, just endless, subtly iridescent whiteness. Anna indicated a simple wooden door featuring a stained glass window of a rainbow lorikeet. \"Wake up.\" Mike stepped closer to the door and turned the handle. Suddenly, he jolted upright in bed, sweat glistening on his toned chest. He ran a hand through his short hair and looked around his room, disoriented. Hearing a faint beeping, he noticed a small blue light flashing on the secure console at his desk. This couldn\u2019t be good. He leaped out of bed, his mind snapping into focus. Braving the cold from the storm outside, he opened the console and watched it power up. \"Attempting connection,\" announced a female robotic voice. \"Verification required.\" Mike glanced through his stolen intelligence files and selected a code taken from one of the police officers. \"Alpha-niner-bravo-six-zero,\" he spoke to the computer. The screen went dark momentarily, then brightened again. \"Welcome, Constable Andrew Jackson.\" Mike waited, and a communication interface appeared, concealing the person on the other side like something out of a cheesy spy movie. \"Michael Langston,\" the voice, heavily distorted, addressed him. \"Who are you?\" Mike demanded. \"How did you get this channel?\" \"That's not important,\" the voice replied. \"There's no time; listen\u2014in one minute, a full squadron will storm your apartment.\" Michael inhaled deeply; just enough time. \"I'm sending you coordinates for a rendezvous,\" said the voice, as Mike felt his wristwatch beep. The coordinates had been sent directly to him. Mike shut down the console, reached into the desk drawer, pulled on a shirt, and grabbed the assault rifle beside the desk. He checked to hear the rounds chamber as he pulled back the working parts. Delving back into the desk, he retrieved an explosive and planted it on the console, then placed the detonator's trigger around his neck.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"Wake up, Mike.\" Her face appeared, unchanged by time, brimming with warmth and compassion\u2014the same face he remembered from six months prior. Her pixie-cut hair, an intriguing blend of brown and auburn, framed her sparkling green eyes and gentle smile. Mike mumbled her name, \"Anna,\" with an edge of guilt. She acknowledged his apology with a reassuring smile and directed his gaze over his shoulder. Before him unfolded a peculiar, seemingly boundless white space\u2014a room with no discernible barriers, shimmering with a faint iridescence. Anna gestured toward a modest wooden door, its stained glass depicting a vivid rainbow lorikeet. \"Wake up,\" she urged softly. As Mike walked towards the door, he hesitantly turned the handle. Instantly, he found himself upright in bed, sweat glistening on his chest. Disoriented, he raked his hand through his short hair. In the room, a low beeping sound drew his attention to a blue light flickering on the secure console at his desk. This couldn't be good. He sprang from the bed, ignoring the chill from the storm outside, and switched on the console. \"Attempting connection,\" murmured a robotic, feminine voice, \"Verification required.\" Scanning through his cache of covert files, Mike selected a code lifted from a police officer. \"Alpha-niner-bravo-six-zero,\" he stated firmly. The screen flickered off and then back on with renewed brightness. \"Welcome, Constable Andrew Jackson,\" it greeted. After a tense pause, a communication interface materialized, masking the figure on the other end with a spy film's flair. \"Michael Langston,\" came a heavily altered voice. \"Who the hell are you?\" Mike demanded. \"How did you tap into this line?\" \"Not relevant,\" the voice replied curtly. \"Time is short. In less than a minute, a squadron will breach your apartment.\" Mike took a deep breath; just enough time to act. \"I'm sending you coordinates for a meetup,\" the voice continued, as Mike's wristwatch vibrated with the incoming data. Quickly, he powered down the console, reached for a shirt, and grabbed the assault rifle within arm's reach. With practiced precision, he checked the chamber. Rummaging in the desk, he retrieved an explosive device, attached it to the console, and secured the detonator around his neck.

There's only so much bliss any consciousness can take, only so much perfection it can experience.'' The noise from shuffling feet along the edges of the granite auditorium were always difficult to overcome at first, and just at the thought his voice was more than adequate. `` The question is n't if you'll want to leave, the question is when. You'll revel...'' It was odd that they raised their hands now, only a short time before they would just blurt out any questions and continue to until they were answered. More interesting was the way the first question had changed. `` Yes, you there in the third tier, your hand was up.'' `` Is... Is this... am I in hell?'' His quivering voice and the terror of miscomprehension was spreading among them all as they turned to one another. They always thought they were in or going to hell. `` No, at least not yet.'' They rarely grasped the concept quickly, no matter how clearly and eloquently stated. It was better to let them have their moment of panic and then reassure them after, they listened much better. They were shouting now, some at him, others to one another, if he let them go long enough they'd start pounding on the stone doors they meandered in from. `` Okay, Okay, OKAY! Whatever you thought when you sat down is either wrong or not a complete perspective.'' `` None of you are dead!'' That was straight out of the textbook and never failed to quell panic, you also got those puzzled faces. It was annoying that every group responded and appeared the same way. `` If you'll give me a brief time without interruption I'll make everything clear as quickly as possible.'' Silence, it was starting to get to him that everything came so easily. `` As I said none of you are actually dead. However, you've died.

You will revel...\" It was unusual to see hands raised now, given that not long ago, people would blurt out questions persistently until they received answers. Even more intriguing was how the nature of the first question had evolved. \"Yes, you in the third tier, I saw your hand.\" \"Am... am I in hell?\" The quavering voice of one participant introduced an air of miscomprehension that quickly spread, prompting worried glances among the audience. They often thought they were in or headed for hell. \"No, at least not yet.\" The concept was rarely understood quickly, no matter how clearly and eloquently it was expressed. Giving them a moment to panic before offering reassurance proved beneficial; they were more attentive afterward. The room grew chaotic with shouting, some directed at him, others between the attendees. If left unchecked, they'd eventually pound on the stone doors they had entered through. \"Okay, okay, OKAY! Whatever your assumptions were when you sat down, they are either incorrect or incomplete.\" \"None of you are dead!\" This line never failed to quell panic and also elicited puzzled looks.

Now, though, hands raised in anticipation, marking a curious change in the nature of inquiries. \"Yes, you over there in the third tier, I noticed your hand.\" There was a tremor in the participant's voice: \"Am... am I in hell?\" This query birthed a sense of bewilderment, spreading faster than one might expect, sharing worried looks among those assembled. Many were convinced they dwelt in or were destined for hell. \"No, not quite\u2014not yet, anyway.\" The notion took time to grasp, despite clear explanations.

My family... where do I even start? After my older brother went off to go and fight, things were quiet for about a week or so. Then, the bombings started.

No, there's something about the architecture: the lines, the colors, none of it feels right. It's all so utterly foreign, so terribly...

When Brian moved to Dallas, I placed an ad on Craigslist for a new roommate. Lucifer, Son of the Morning, was the only person to respond. When he came for the interview, I was surprised to find out that he was Middle Eastern and also an older gentleman.

After a brief tour, I explained the apartment complex by-laws, including the regulations concerning pets, noise after ten at night, and reservation of the courtyard gazebo and barbecue. Lucifer smiled and signed on the spot a sublease I had prepared in advance. On the day he moved in, Lucifer immediately began to seek concessions to suit his comfort.

He asked that I move my fifty inch LED TV into my bedroom, even though the bedroom was not a large enough space for a screen of that dimension.

I think about you constantly, everywhere I go, time and again. I remember our first meeting in the park. You were feeding the ducks, and I was nearby on a bench. I recall the longing glance we shared when the ducks suddenly flew away, and as their feathers settled around you, you looked like an angel.\" She trembled like a puppy\u2014surely glowing with happiness! He took both her hands, cradling them like precious gems. \"That's why I visited you; when I found your wallet in the park, I struggled with whether to return it as a friend or reveal my true feelings. Here I am.\" Tears of joy fell from her face, but he hadn't reached the best part. \"These are my true feelings. You're so beautiful, so kind... I love you. I'll always love you, even if the world turns against us. You're my entire world, my very being.\" She looked away, overcome with emotion.

It\u2019s like a wave, ready to crash.\" With an awkward but sincere gesture, he lowered himself to one knee, giving her a smile that was equal parts nervous and hopeful. \"Christie, I love you,\" he said, his voice wobbly but resolute. \"Overwhelming love\u2014it\u2019s all I think about, no matter where I am.\" He paused, his mind drifting back to the park where they first met\u2014where she fed ducks, blissfully unaware of his presence on the nearby bench. The memory of their quiet exchange\u2014an unspoken moment when the ducks took flight, leaving feathers to settle like snowflakes around her\u2014felt as vivid as if it were yesterday. \"You looked like an angel then,\" he mused, watching her tremble\u2014not unlike an excitable puppy, surely radiant with joy. Holding her hands tenderly, as if they were treasures, he continued, \"After finding your wallet at the park, I was torn. Should I come back as just a friend, or finally tell you how I truly feel?

His grin widened, feeling the pinnacle of his own emotions ready to burst forth. \"Christie, will you say yes?\" Of course, the answer was evident; it always had been since the day they crossed paths at the park that windy afternoon. --- Meanwhile, at a quiet house now bustling with intense activity, the officer finally arrived, disbelief evident on his face. This neighborhood, usually silent, buzzed with investigators and suits. Inside, his partner met him with news that hit like a punch. \"Glad you could make it.

A monster taped over her mouth, leading to suffocation in a grotesque manner,\" his partner explained. \"Any clues on our perpetrator?\" \"We\u2019ve got the hard evidence.

His auburn hair\u2014greasy and wild\u2014crowded his delicate features, nearly obscuring the freckles that peppered his skin. Those olive eyes of his had a way of lighting up when he grinned, weaving charm effortlessly. Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

But tonight, instead of ivy-covered halls, he's here under the moonlit shadows of Chicago, responding to a piercing call: a body found near the pier.

For a drowned man, his features retained an uncanny flawlessness\u2014a thick mustache, possibly blue eyes beneath those lids, and a sharply defined nose framed by thin, blue lips. His attire spoke of unchallenged elegance: a sleek blue business suit hung open, revealing a white shirt tarnished by scarlet stains of blood\u2014a testament to the grievous wound at his chest.

Ted, however, remained uncertain. `` I do n't think you're seeing my point.'' Ted replied solemnly to the big man with black eyes and black scruff. `` So what am I missing?'' Ted mulled it over for a minute trying to think of the best and easiest way to convey his meaning. Out in the golden street before him Tiff and Aubrey chatted happily pointing and discussing the beautiful golden apples that grew in abundance on a large tree. His two beautiful wives, captured in the pinnacle of their beauty. Their presence filled him with an insurmountable joy, but also an incredibly nagging apprehension. Ted's mouth tightened and he turned to Nat to answer, `` I love both of my wives Natson. I want to be my best for them, but how can I give them both, my everything?

Ted nodded, he so badly wanted that to be true. Nat's genuine smile seemed to reinforce his words beyond measure, but still there was this nag in the back of Ted's head that made him question. Sitting there on that golden bench, in the pleasant breeze Ted grappled with his pestering predicament. Nat was a good friend, but only a friend he'd known in the afterlife. In his bodily form, Nat lived and died many years before Ted. Natson Henry Copper, was his name. He was born English and his voice still held that distinct Londoner accent hammered in by years of leisurely living, sprinkled with raucous events, that gave flavor to his tone and expression. In heaven, Natson was Ted's guide. Veterans of the afterlife were always assigned to new arrivals until they understood the new world around them.

However, Ted remained doubtful. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting my point,\u201d he replied solemnly, looking at the big man with dark eyes and stubble. \u201cSo what am I missing?\u201d Ted pondered for a moment, searching for the best way to express his thoughts. In the golden street ahead, Tiff and Aubrey were chatting merrily, pointing at a large tree laden with beautiful golden apples. His two radiant wives, frozen in the prime of their beauty, filled him with immense joy but also a nagging apprehension. With his lips tightening, Ted turned to Natson and said, \u201cI love both of my wives, Natson. I want to give them my best, but how can I offer each of them my all? They both deserve the attention and love that one alone can receive.\u201d Natson sighed with understanding, his eyes twinkling with the wisdom of a man who had lived a full life. \u201cSo you don\u2019t think you\u2019re enough for two wonderful women?\u201d Natson asked. \u201cWell...

Natson\u2019s genuine smile reinforced his words, yet a persistent doubt lingered in Ted\u2019s mind. As he sat on the golden bench, feeling the gentle breeze, he grappled with his persisting dilemma. Natson was a good friend, though one he had only known in the afterlife. In his earlier life, Natson had lived and died long before Ted. His full name was Natson Henry Copper, and he hailed from England. His distinct London accent, shaped by years of leisurely living sprinkled with lively adventures, added a unique flavor to his speech. In heaven, Natson served as Ted\u2019s guide.

But Ted, still pensive, didn't seem convinced. \"I don't think you're grasping my concern,\" Ted replied, his demeanor serious as his dark eyes met Natson's stubbly face. \"Where am I going astray?\" Natson wondered aloud, keen to understand. Ted hesitated, collecting his thoughts. Ahead, on the shimmering golden road, Tiff and Aubrey were engaged in lively chatter, their attention captured by a majestic tree dotted with brilliant golden apples. His elegant wives embodied a timeless beauty, evoking sheer delight yet stirring a dose of unease within him. Tightening his lips, Ted addressed Natson, \"Natson, I adore both my wives. I wish to give them everything, but how do I truly provide each of them with all my heart?

Natson\u2019s warm smile lent weight to his reassuring words, although a stubborn worry remained lodged in Ted\u2019s mind. Seated on the gleaming bench as a gentle breeze brushed against him, Ted wrestled with this enduring dilemma. Natson, a steadfast friend, had entered his life posthumously, having lived and passed long before Ted's earthly years concluded. Natson Henry Copper, the full name he carried, was originally from England. His voice, seasoned by a London accent and a history of leisurely pursuits intermingled with spirited adventures, added color to his spoken word. Here in heaven, Natson took on the role of Ted\u2019s guide, a practice where experienced souls paired up with newcomers, easing their transition.

It doesn't, though, and guilt still keeps me up through many restless nights. My father was the one who taught me how to drive, standing beside me with a steady presence in that old red farm truck. Its paint was rusting away, almost as if it were mirroring the passage of time. Dad, a wizard with tractors and trucks ever since he was a young boy, instilled in us a reverence for the road. In my family, there seemed to be a silent understanding that left my sister and me in the safety of the house, while our brothers tackled farm chores, mastering machinery like it was second nature. Maybe they had their reasons for that decision. I wasn\u2019t reckless\u2014I was just a jittery kid who had to stretch her legs to reach the pedals. It was a Wednesday after school when Dad took me on a drive across the county, a journey meant for skill honing. My grip on the wheel was akin to a vice at 10 and 2, hands slick with an anxiety that didn't go unnoticed. Despite his booming voice reprimanding my too-hard or too-soft braking, his intent was protective rather than paranoid\u2014just a parent wanting his child safe on the asphalt. Lessons on four-way stops were drilled in, lectures on the perils of texting behind the wheel ensued, and even parallel parking emerged\u2014a skill I'd practice between hay bales with cattle watching from their pasture. On a quieter road, Dad turned the radio\u2019s volume up, joining Willie Nelson in song, his voice rough yet comforting. Bit by bit, confidence found its way into my hands, and his words, \"That's it, keep it steady,\" echoed as I dared to press the accelerator more firmly on the gravel. I treasure this story, clinging to its warmth amidst a harsher reality. Just six weeks before I turned sixteen, my dad passed unexpectedly, an accident that snatched away his laughter and pride. The memory of him remains vivid\u2014his smile alive in my rearview mirror every time I revisit that drive, a moment untainted by the heartache that would follow.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

As a flight attendant began serving lunch, the lights came back on, drawing passengers' attention to the food and drink cart. It was the perfect distraction. \"Aaahhhh!\" The scream was music to his ears; the attendant had slipped on the toothpaste, and the cart toppled onto her. \"What is happening?

Mingling with fellow passengers at the boarding area, he fell in line as the crew shouted, \"PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS; WE'RE ABOUT TO DEPART.\" After a brief skirmish for positioning, the would-be hijacker settled by the cockpit, poised for his perilous gamble.

Inside the sanctuary of the restroom, he glanced to ensure solitude before clandestinely spreading toothpaste on the floor, an innocuous ruse.

It called out to me, it told me to turn around. I froze. This was the most terrifying thing I had ever experienced. But I did listen to it and as I turned around I saw a shadow figure standing there, in the dark. Clapping my hands to shed more light on it did n't help.

My apologies, sir,\" Robin responded. \"I regret taking your hope away. They'll not come.\" \"Pardon?\" I asked, baffled. \"Your men have been held up,\" I revealed.

It had been ten days since they crossed into the Black Side and three since they dropped off the kid, and the crew was on edge. It had been 10 years since anyone had attempted an expedition to the Dark Continent, and they always ended the same. Sailors would land on the eerily hot sand, collect plant samples, and dig some holes and pan rivers for precious metals or gems ( *never* finding a damn thing ). But it was only a matter of time before the natives came and attacked everyone. `` Attack *the torch carriers*'', Sir William had said when Norris first tried to talk him out of this crazy mission. `` They always first attack sources of fire. I wo n't be needing a torch, so I wo n't have that problem.'' Norris had chuckled. He felt bad for the kid. Sir William Mason, at age 16, was the oldest person that had ever lived with Sun Sickness. His affliction was an incredibly common one that affected roughly one in ten newborns. Their weird little eyes ( if you could even call them that ) were incredibly sensitive to light and their skin blistered almost immediately in the sun. No amount of clothing or covers seemed to be completely effective at blocking the sun's effects, and children rarely lived to see their second birthday. It had become common practice to kill newborns with Sun Sickness to spare them from their few years of pain, and the High Priest had even endorsed this as a form of mercy. But William's parents could not bear to kill their firstborn and resolved to find a way to allow him to live comfortably. They had a wing of their mansion completely sealed from the sun and hired blind servants and tutors to raise the boy in his own little world. When the time came to train him how to get around in the dark, everyone was amazed that he had completely perfect night vision. He grew up comfortable, but restless. `` I was living in a five-room prison when there was a whole half a planet devoid of sun,'' William had said through the little communication slit of his box ( the oddest piece of cargo Norris had ever hauled ). `` The Dark Continent is where I belong. I'm sure of it. What if the natives are just like me?

Inevitably, the natives would arrive and attack. \"They always go for the sources of fire first,\" Sir William had warned when Norris initially tried to dissuade him from this reckless mission. \"I won't need a torch, so that's one less worry for me.\" Norris had laughed at this. He felt sorry for the kid. Sir William Mason, at age 16, was the oldest known survivor with Sun Sickness, a common affliction affecting about one in ten newborns. These children had peculiar, nearly light-blind eyes, and their skin blistered almost instantly under the sun.

When it was time to teach him to navigate in the dark, it was astonishing how perfect his night vision was.

Past ventures saw sailors disembark onto searing hot sands, hopeful as they gathered plant samples, dug deep holes, or panned the riverside for elusive minerals. Yet, all too predictably, they returned empty-handed. Just as inevitably, the natives would launch sudden, fierce attacks. Norris recalled Sir William\u2019s cautionary words vividly. \"Their first target is always the source of fire,\" he had mentioned with a cryptic assurance that made Norris uneasy when he first attempted to talk him out of what he considered a foolhardy mission. \"Lucky for me, I won't be needing a torch,\" Sir William had smirked, trying to insert a bit of lightness into their weighty conversation. Norris had chuckled then, though he couldn\u2019t shake off the sympathy he felt for the kid. Sir William Mason, despite his tender age of 16, was an anomaly\u2014a rare survivor bearing the burden of Sun Sickness.

He thrived comfortably in this sheltered existence, but his spirit, inherently restless, yearned for more.

I can feel it. What if the natives share my affliction?\" A deckhand whispered tales of spotting one with \"eyes like those cursed by Sun Sickness,\" though Norris remained skeptical.

There are a ton of other prompts out there that deserve your attention, provocations that could truly stretch your creative muscles. Just consider this gem: [A world where consuming humans is perfectly normal and lawful, but dining on animals is the most reviled, illegal act imaginable.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20tou7/wp_a_world_where_eating_people_is_perfectly/). Remember that character you devised almost a year ago\u2014the blond, bespectacled coroner with some, um, interesting predilections? This scenario could fit her like a glove, yet she\u2019s languished unused. Imagine her subtle quirks, like showing how she \"enjoys playing with her food.\" What was her name, anyway? Or maybe a more slippery phrase prompt might spark your interest: [\"At my third birthday party, the cake only had two candles.\"] (http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20u9sx/wp_at_my_third_birthday_party_the_cake_only_had/). This could unravel into a fascinating tale of a changeling, whether set in a whimsical fantasy landscape or the stark corridors of sci-fi. Picture a universe where time itself is tangled, birthdays celebrated out of sequence with no clear rhyme or reason. Just think of the narrative avenues this opens up\u2014surely more enticing than /u/Future-Starter\u2019s meta-maze. Oh! Here\u2019s another captivating one: [\"Can I buy just one bullet?\"] (http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/20rudv/wp_can_i_buy_just_one_bullet/). Is this request sinister? Suicidal? Or maybe it's a setup for something much more nuanced? Imagine a protagonist in pursuit of a single bullet, the same one that was supposed to have been part of an elaborate ploy by her partner\u2014real yet life-saving for her, yet fatal for him. In her world, bullets extracted are just recycled junk, melted down without a second thought, but she yearns to hold onto that single piece as a testament to his sacrifice. Admittedly, Cobbie, these ideas might sound a tad outrageous, but isn't there magic in that? Many extraordinary tales spring from the most unlikely seeds. So, why cling to the familiar and unchallenging? Break free from the predictable trodden path! Just pick *anything* other than that meta-prompt from /u/Future-Starter!

The incident was reported in the local news, and became a major discussion in the city. Why would the Americans kill one of their own? Was it a threat? AUGUST 7, 1945.

Just sit back and do nothing?\" yet another voice questioned. Before the debate could continue, the President interrupted, \"Gentlemen,\" his voice commanding immediate silence. The men settled back into their chairs, curiosity piqued. \"We do have another option,\" he declared. Surprise rippled through the room.

His fists had managed to save him so many times before, but now, they were useless. He glanced anxiously around, looking for a way out of this. But Perjury, the fiend who stood before him, grinning like a banshee, knew that this one was foolproof. Many a time The Iron Fist had managed to escape from his clutches. Not this time. \u201c No?

The bullet flew down and hit its mark, the bridge of Perjury \u2019 s nose. His head exploded in a shower of blood, killing the villain immediately in a spectacular and efficient fashion. His lifeless body flopped down onto the cold concrete floor, the one sided battle well and truly over.

This ceremony has been part of my life since my teenage years. Yet, once the sweater joined my daily ensemble, things went haywire. I'd dive into the sweater pocket for a cigarette, only to discover it pre-loaded with that and a lighter. \"What the...?\" That was just the beginning of my saga with this baffling garment. Summer arrived, and the sweater clung to me like an indispensable charm. An absurd thing, surely! Take, for instance, the time I managed to lock myself out. Gazing ruefully at my keys through the window, I embarked on a shaky climb to reclaim them from my bedroom. Lo and behold! When they dropped into the sweater pocket, my door key was mysteriously waiting there, detached from the ring. How uncanny is that? Another evening, I misplaced my wallet at a bustling downtown bar. Imagine my disbelief when, challenged by a bouncer at my favorite haunt, my ID surfaced from the depths of that left pocket! I'd lamented my fiscal woes to friends, only to discover a crisp fifty-dollar bill tucked inside snugly. \"How did... Never mind. Grab me a beer, will you? This is enough to make one lose their mind.\" It wasn't just fortunate financially; I ended up meeting someone special that night, leading to a whirlwind relationship that lasted half a year. Conveniently, a condom emerged from my pocket just when it mattered most. Over time, this magical sweater revealed itself to be more than a bearer of good luck. Whenever I wasn't wearing it, I'd return home to find all my belongings neatly back inside that same problematic pocket. A mischief-maker at play? My suspicions turned towards my girlfriend. \"Let's have a chat. Something's fishy here...\" I broached the subject, only to be blindsided as she admitted to cheating. Funny, I never did resolve the mystery of that enigmatic pocket.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

Her eyes dimmed like blown-out candles. `` I mean... can you love now? With all that... junk in your brain?'' I could feel my eyes tightening like red-hot coils. I felt like some part of me was.. untethering. Letting go. Dimming out. Sometimes I wish I could just -- no. breathe. Rein it back in. Stay here. `` I can love,'' I said, `` just like you can. I'm not a damn robot, Ela.'' Why has this been happening? I've been so angry lately. Always so angry. Maybe dangerously angry. I was starting to worry. There were a couple spots in my memory. Dark spots. Things happened that I do n't remember. Bad things; I know, because I'd come back to awareness a few times with blood on my knuckles. I turned from her and searched the patio of the coffee shop for something, anything, to cool me down.

I turned back to Ela as she spoke. `` Jonsan. I did n't mean it.'' I nodded enough to let her know she'd been heard. But if I looked at her, really caught her muddy brown eyes with my water-blue ones, I'd feel the anger again. But maybe not looking at her made it worse, because it made the disgust in her voice that much clearer. `` Look, I'm sorry. I did n't mean to hurt your feelings, okay? It's just... hard. Getting used to it. You. We thought you were dead, after that accident.'' So did I. `` We came to terms with it. Accepted it. This is hard for us, too.'' Her voice wavered a little, and once I may have felt sorry for her. I may have touched her hand and comforted her. But instead, I felt the darkness creeping in. I was losing it, losing touch again, I could n't let it - `` Listen, fucko. This is n't easy for me, either. How the hell do you think it is for me?'' I yanked at my shirt, because it kept me from yanking the hair out of her skull.

I'm not a damn robot, Ela.\" Why was this happening? I'd been so angry lately. Always angry. Maybe dangerously so. It worried me. There were blank spots in my memory. Dark spots. Things had happened that I couldn't recall. Bad things; I knew because I'd return to awareness with bloodied knuckles. I turned away from her and scanned the coffee shop patio for something to calm me down. I zeroed in on some frosty concoction overloaded with whipped cream, sauce, and wafers\u2014it looked like diabetes in a cup with extra diabetes on top. I wanted it. I turned back as Ela spoke. \"Jonsan. I didn't mean it.\" I nodded to show I'd heard her. But if I truly looked into her muddy brown eyes with my watery blue ones, the anger would surge back. Yet not looking made it worse, amplifying the disdain in her voice. \"Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, okay? It's just... hard. Adjusting. To you. We thought you were dead after the accident.\" So did I. \"We made peace with that. Accepted it. This is difficult for us too.\" Her voice wavered slightly. Before, I might have felt sympathy, might have held her hand to comfort her. Instead, darkness crept in, and I was losing it, disconnecting again. I couldn't let it\u2014\"Listen, this isn't easy for me, either. How do you think it feels for me?\" I gripped my shirt to stop myself from pulling her hair out.

Inside, I felt an unraveling\u2014a sort of slipping away into the void. Ah, scratch that thought. Breathe, just breathe, I told myself, mentally stitching the fragments back together. Stay grounded. \"I can love,\" I replied sharply, \"just the same as anyone else. I'm not some mechanical thing, Ela.\" What had triggered this? Rage had become a familiar, ominous companion lately, perhaps too familiar. It gnawed at me. Gaps punctuated my thoughts, like smudged ink blotches in old letters, marked by inexplicable bursts of fury. Bad stuff lurked within those blurs\u2014evidence visible in bruised knuckles when I resurfaced from them. Turning away from her, my gaze roved over the buzz of the coffee shop patio, craving calm. My eyes landed on a monstrous cup of frosty decadence, piled high with whipped cream, draped in syrup, and speared with wafers\u2014it was a sugar avalanche waiting to happen. Temptation glanced back at me over the top of that sinful concoction. Ela\u2019s voice broke the spell. \"Jonsan. I didn't mean it.\" I nodded, acknowledging her words without letting them run deep. A full-on stare into her muddied brown eyes with my faded blue ones would send anger rolling back like a tidal wave.

It\u2019s... challenging, adapting to everything, including you. After the accident, we thought you were gone.\" So did I, actually. \"We grieved, accepted that. This is hard on us too, you know?\" Her words trembled. Once, perhaps, I\u2019d have taken her hand, as if it could somehow bridge the emotional chasm. Instead, shadows encroached, and there I was, teetering on the brink yet again. Couldn\u2019t let it pull me under. \"This is hell on my end too, believe me. You think this is easy for me?\" My grip on my shirt tightened\u2014a feeble dam holding against the urge to lash out.

It's all rather ordinary, save for my wondrous wife, who still stuns me; how did I get so lucky? As my mind begins its usual drift, she pulls me back, laughter in her eyes. \"Where are you wandering off to, silly?\" Her words tug me from distant daydreams, and I meet her gaze with a smile, \"Always you.\" I draw her onto my lap, her lips feigning disapproval, though her eyes say otherwise. \"You caveman, knock it off,\" she manages to tease before I silence her with a kiss. Her warmth? It spreads through me, setting fire to my soul. This is the summit. A happy man, that's me. Did I mention perfect? An oddity perhaps, my wife is an early sleeper, and odd as it sounds, we have separate rooms for slumber. Other couples may do this, yet telling a friend drew endless comments\u2014\"She's using you,\" \"She's cheating for sure,\" \"Leave her, she's odd.\" Well, no thank you. I found it unusual at first too, but considering our fantastic romance and her being a solid 11 out of 10, you won't hear complaints from me.

There was but one imprinted in my mind\u2014created by the faceless voices that placed us in this sweltering circle: the idea of nothingness. The fear of finality and closure was petrifying. So I ran. I ran and ran. Others kept falling, and the observers methodically dragged them away, leaving jagged trails in the sand. In the end, it was just me, trampling the bloody sand into clots. My legs felt like they were on fire, hotter than the sun itself. My eyes, dry and filled with sand, made blinking torture. Suddenly, my face hit the scorching sand, grains digging into my pores. I had stopped. Fear took over. Frantically, I tried to use my numbed arms to push myself up. I had to keep running, but it was no use. I fell onto my scabbed back.

Running became my world\u2014an incessant march through heat and grit. At some point, the sensation of hot sand scouring my lungs and the sharp burn of blisters seemed almost trivial, so constant they were. Around me, other white-clad figures moved mechanically, replicas in this relentless cycle, indistinguishable from my own shadow. Torn feet trudged forward, ribs jutting out from sunken skin, faces carved with desperation. Such sights no longer shocked me; my tears ran dry. When those withered souls faltered, pulled away by dark-clad watchers, my empathy had long since evaporated. Nothing broke the trance of my endless trot. The parched arena, a prison of motion, absorbed all I knew. Daylight punished us, an unyielding enemy, while the moon at midnight promised a reprieve that never came. Night's embrace was forgotten, like a lullaby from a distant time. I remembered softer moments when human touch was familiar, when my legs obeyed normal commands, my voice didn\u2019t hide in raspy whispers. Back when speech and stride meant more than survival\u2014those days felt mythical now. The length of time, the separation from sustenance\u2014these concepts blurred under the undying sun. Thoughts were scarce and unyielding, except one idea etched by invisible forces: emptiness. The terror of an end, perhaps worse than the fiery trials itself, clung to me. So, I kept running. And running. One by one, others fell like forgotten leaves, dragged out of sight by ever-watchful guardians, leaving behind trails etched into the sand. Alone now, I churned through crimson grains, every step a spark of agony. My eyes, blistered and gritty, fought to find relief in the simplest motion. Then\u2014I stumbled. The ground rose to meet my face; sand invaded my skin, filling every crevice. Stopped, immobilized, fear surged. I struggled against feeble limbs, trying to rise, to run again. But exhaustion claimed me, pulling me back into the earth.

SK scanned ahead, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It always did with Halo, but her performance made up for the talking. Her body also helped, a trim model put out by a private engineer, its performance and shape tuned to perfection. A call came down the pipe for wet-work, and after checking the regular channels, he took it. Some slag over in the Red Light District had found himself on the wrong side of someone with power -- a death sentence ticking down to a hammer click and muzzle flash. Standard contract rules applied, so the job would get done, even if it took him several tries to do it right. `` The job, I get. It's the only way to make cash down here. But why go full droid when you did n't have to?'' She'd brought it up before, a pretext to talking about herself. If he were n't certain of her capabilities, the barrage of questions would make him wonder if she were afraid. Fear on the job got you killed, and SK planned on living a long, prosperous life. Coming down to this part of town meant dealing with the garish nature of a three-square mile mausoleum of vice. Neon and holos crawled across the exposed metallic flesh of every bar, whorehouse, and drug den. Each place belted out their specialties in hopes of starving out competition, even though good escorts would n't dare run down here. The verbal brawl and detached crowds made for perfect cover; no one wanted to find themselves on the wrong side of a barrel over a misunderstanding. `` We each have our reasons, let's leave it at that.'' Flexing a hand, SK let his aiming scripts run in the background while he brought building layouts and the target's info up on his visor. The guy was a low-level pusher, his main product a variant of speed put on the market after years of military use. It was good shit, the kind he'd use if he still had a body to feel the high. But that was the past. `` No, seriously, I want to know. Why'd you do it?'' Lowering her hood, Halo winced a smile, the chrome of her face curving as though it were flesh. It was crazy what engineering could accomplish these days, even if the distinction between meat and metal was clear as ice. The building was a old bar, shut down thanks to bad location and a few unfortunate brawls.", "text_ai_base": "\"Do you ever regret it?\" Halo asked. \"Is this really the time for that? We have a job to do,\" SK replied, scanning the area and bracing for what typically followed in conversations with Halo. Her performance usually justified her chatter, and her form\u2014a sleek design by a private engineer\u2014was optimized to perfection. A wet-work call had come through the usual channels, and SK accepted. Some poor guy in the Red Light District had crossed someone powerful, and his death seemed inevitable\u2014a mere trigger pull away. Following standard contract rules, SK would see the job through, even if it took multiple attempts to get it right. \"I understand the job; it's the only way to earn money here. But why go full droid when you didn't have to?\" Halo asked, circling back to a familiar topic, subtly shifting the focus to herself. If SK weren\u2019t confident in her skills, he'd suspect her questions hinted at fear\u2014a liability in their line of work. He had every intention of living a long, successful life, and in this neon-lit, vice-ridden part of town, survival meant understanding the risks. Glowing ads and projections blazed across every bar, brothel, and drug den, each establishment vying to outdo the others, though no good escort ventured here. The chaotic scene and scattered crowds provided excellent cover; nobody wanted to risk being mistakenly drawn into a dangerous confrontation. \"We each have our reasons; let's leave it at that.\" SK flexed his hand, letting his targeting software run silently while he studied building layouts and the target's information on his visor. The target was a low-ranking dealer, selling a speed variant adapted from military formulas. It was potent stuff\u2014the kind SK might have indulged in if he still had a body to experience it. But that was in the past. \"Seriously, why did you do it?\" Halo asked again. As she lowered her hood, her smile crinkled the chrome of her face as if it were real flesh. It was astounding what engineers could achieve now, despite the stark line between human and machine. The target was in an old bar, now shuttered due to its poor location and a few ill-fated brawls.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"Ever look back and think twice about this?\" Halo threw out the question, nudging not just for an answer, but perhaps a peek into motivation. SK, however, barely flinched, eyes scanning their surroundings with a practiced detachment. \"Is this really the right moment for that kind of soul-searching? We\u2019ve got a job on deck,\" he said, his focus unbroken\u2014a mental fortress fortified against the predictability of these exchanges with Halo. Her talents were undeniable, nearly rivalling the precision of her sleekly engineered form, a masterpiece of private ingenuity. The wet-work call was standard fare, filtered through the usual shadowy channels. Some unfortunate soul in the Red Light District had crossed the wrong heavyweight, and SK was the instrument of their inevitable fate. The mission complied with all the usual contract stipulations, ensuring its completion, however many attempts might be required. Halo, persisting in her line of questioning, asked, \"Why choose to go full droid when you had other paths? I mean, money\u2019s one thing, but\u2026\u201d She trailed, her curiosity shifting the spotlight momentarily onto herself. To SK, her persistence could\u2019ve easily been mistaken for anxiety\u2014a worrying trait in their line of work if he didn't trust her prowess. He preferred a future long and lucrative, and in this neon-drenched urban sprawl, understanding risk equated to survival. Around them, vibrant ads and holograms battled for attention above every bar, brothel, and drug den. It was quite the spectacle; intimidating even. Good escorts stayed clear-eyed, wary of accidental entanglements in some unwelcome affair. \"We all have our motives, don\u2019t we? Best leave it there,\" SK retorted, flexing his synthetic hand. His targeting software quietly hummed\u2014ever vigilant\u2014as his visor fed him blueprints and dossiers. Their quarry? A minor drug peddler, pushing a high-octane variant of speed tweaked from military concoctions. Tempting stuff, had SK retained a flesh-and-blood form to savor it. But that was another life, a distant memory now. Halo, relentless, probed further, \"But seriously, what drove you to choose this path?\" Lowering her hood, her smile seemed to animate the chrome, bending it in an uncanny imitation of human expression. Engineering feats barely shy of miraculous, despite the chasm between human and machine. Their target lay holed up in a derelict bar, its operation halted by its misfortune of location and a string of predictable bar brawls.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

The room was tilted and spinning, like one of those mazes with the metal ball. *What was in this drink? * I looked deep into the red cup. *Or was it blue? * I could n't tell in the morphing carousel of movement.

The churning lights still mutated their faces into grotesque phantasms of themselves. They had stopped moving. Hands at their sides, their ever-changing faces peered at me with dead, green eyes. The bass urged me deeper and deeper into the plush walls, as it came over my shoulder. I still held the curious drink in front of me, and as the wall sucked me further back into the embrace of what was concrete a few minutes ago, I felt an unmistakable calm. The wall came over my ears and the sleepy roll of the music sunk into me. My arm was still outstretched as to keep the empty faces of the other revelers at bay - `` Look, I've got a drink.'' It was warm inside the wall, and I let it take me. I took one last sip from the drink, my very last one, and the wall encompassed my head.

Mr Morris, the science teacher who had drawn the short straw this year and been forced to organise the science fair, slowly began to realise why his colleagues had all smirked when he had told them he was allocating tables alphabetically. With a flourish, Mr Mitchell removed the sheet that had been covering their project - an exact working replica of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano and turn glared across at the Mifflins and their Mount Etna reproduction. Icy looks passed between the two fathers and the children peeked out from behinds their legs. David poking out his tongue. Mr Mitchell fussed around, setting up the replica while Mr Mifflin suddenly found reason to recheck the placement of the 42 scale trees he had carefully created from scratch. The checking continued frantically, each father slapping away his child's attempts to help, right up until the judges arrived at their tables. The lead judge was, as always, Dr Smith, the schools head teacher but this year he had with him a guest judge - Michelle Wallis, a local Chemist who had joined the PTA and whose own daughter was just a few years from her first competition. Mr Mortis trailed behind them. `` Well well, what a fine pair of volcanos!'' Dr Smith's voice boomed out. `` Say, it might be fun to judge them together?'' He turned to his fellow judge but then nodded before she could reply `` Excellent, let's begin!'' Both fathers jumped forward and began to speak and Dr Smith had to wave them silent. `` One at a time I think!'' He pointed to Mr Mifflin `` you first I think.'' With some smugness Mr Mifflin began. `` I present to you a complete scale model of Mount Etna, the *best known* of all the volcanos.'' Mr Mitchell snorted. `` Here you see we have created the surrounds and scale models of local villages. Of course this model is designed to show the incredible power of the earth and the frightening force of nature.'' Dr Smith interrupted. `` Very good, let's see it work then.''

Occasionally it was more interesting than what was on TV, but most of the time it just led to empty bathrooms. In fact, it was mostly just a pain, as Fredrick could n't use a mirror to see how he looked. This led to some awkward situations but thankfully he quickly realized he could use the selfie camera on his phone to fix his face instead.

At first he thought his powers must have turned off, but then the other him moved his arm at a slightly different angle than he did. He mouthed to the other him `` can you see me'' only to find the other him was mouthing it along with him. They gathered a notepad and began to communicate. The conversation grew quite boring, as conversations with someone whom you can predict their every sentence tend to get. He discovered the other him's world was basically exactly the same. So they both decided to end the conversation, as the conversation was n't any better than thinking to oneself. Then one day something extra peculiar happened. When he looked in his bathroom mirror, all he saw was a complete black void. He checked the other mirror in his house. About half of them were void as well.

Fredrick was thankful he lived in a city with a lot of public transportation, due to his inability to use mirrors properly driving was extra dangerous. Once at work, he checked the mirrors there. About 3 fourths of them were void. He did n't bother putting much mental effort as to why this was happening. He figured it was just his special ability glitching out. During his coffee break he looked at the view outside. It was already dark. Not just dusk but middle of the night dark. He looked at his watch, it was only 3 pm.

You know you will be missed, and yet you know that when it comes, You will ride on the wings of an eagle to the light and the love. It is that gorgeous inner peace that will not be known again on this earth. We traded that simple peace for eternal beauty. That was the kind of wisdom Jared loved spouting.

Yet -- I could n't help but notice that my internet history had just been cleared.

They would be in a circle, with my cat sitting at the head, like they were having a frickin' seance or something. Sometimes there would be books laid out by them... often gruesome, deathly books that depicted horrific executions and torture. It was getting very bad. I'd be taking a shower and when I came out....there she was. Sitting on the counter, just watching me. A completely straight face, unblinking. Yet something always seemed.....sinister... about those eyes. Then the killing started. Oh, the killing. Dead birds -- -then came the dead raccoons, and otters, and soon enough a fox then a wolf....what kind of cat kills a fox? I was worried, so I thought about bringing my cat to the vet. Like they could do anything. Little did I know it, but she was beyond help then. I was n't, but I did n't know that yet either. She always resisted the visits to the vet though.

Because of this, I let her path be guided by her parents and I allow time to let her develop some individuality. I never intervene while she matures, that is not my place.

In a few years I was a middle manager in charge of online presence. 10 years ago the internet was very different, and when social media appeared I was one of the first in the company to realise it's potential.

Nothing could have prepared me for what came next ) - I want to to get a job at Pepsi Co. And then to spy on them to me. You will get an enourmous sum of money from us where you can fuel your drug habit. I looked at him with a blank stare, I thought I had hidden my drug problems quite well. Apparantely I did not. Anyway, that was a few years ago. I applied to Pepsi and presented myself at the interview as a disgrunted employee that wants to jump ship. As I was relative known in the industry and I knew lots of things about Coca-Cola I was quickly hired. I would give them honest insight as best I knew and I also made friends with the people I worked. It was not hard as I always managed to make friends. Every weekend I would meet a guy at a fast food joint and we would discuss what I have learned that week. So during the years I would slowly climb ranks inside the company, gaining some promotions along the way, and at the same time getting a lot more money from cocacola for information.

Should I attempt to decode these alien symbols, or just leave everything to chance, zip through the answers, and retreat to wallow in despair at home? Honestly, retreating seemed mighty appealing. So, with a sigh, I embarked on a journey of guesswork. For the first question, I chose C, followed by A, then B, whimsically creating \"CAB.\" I ventured on with DAD, BAD, and ACE, throwing in a playful \"BAA\" (like a sheep!) here and there. \"DECADE\" became my valiant effort at order. And, to cap it off, I selected C for the last five questions\u2014because, well, isn't it common wisdom that 'C' is a safe bet? Having completed my ill-fated choices, I handed in my paper, trudged home, secluded myself, and indulged in a marathon cry session that lasted five days. By the end, a seed of acceptance grew within me; if repeating the year was my fate, perhaps I could live with it. Surprisingly, this thought brought an unexpected peace.

The little letter selector was replaced by a handful of numbers. The shipping label had something in the note section.'We need to talk.' I was a fair bit shocked. Some of the child's fear returned, but the adult mind suppressed it. The thought went that anything that wanted to talk probably did n't mean harm.

Far-away tragedies - wars, natural disasters - seemed to occur at critical moments to pull me out of my self-absorption. Those close to me came and went.

I cursed God who I mistakenly blamed for taking her from me, science that could not save her, other people and forces for no better reasons. Of course I blamed myself as well. The years that followed were dark and lonesome. And finally death - not the dark, ominous concept, but the being itself - stood before me. For the first time, I looked into his eyes. I saw his relief - almost an innocence, like I'd had before he first made his power known to me. Happiness to be rid of his burden, too - an overwhelming joy I'd not felt since before he'd stolen my love from me. He may no longer hold the power he'd given me, but the wisdom of eons remained. He could see my thoughts - my anger as I thought back to all that he had taken from me, all he had put me through. And I saw his fear, a familiar sensation from when I felt that my own death was close. But I also thought back on all he'd taught me. The old man cowered before me.

In that raw period, I vented fury toward God for taking her, criticized science for its helplessness, blamed those around me and circumstances without any real justification.

I mean, what else would it be? It was fitted with a series of solar panels to keep it powered and since it certainly would n't be receiving any upkeep, we built it to last. You see, that's one thing we're damn good at, making things last. And the only reason the LES1 ceased transmission was because a fault in it's launch put it in an imperfect orbit, so honestly, had we know a bit more about which way it went, we could have told you that it could come back. That's not what surprised us. No, not the... It was n't the return, it's what came with it that surprised us. Again, when we got those signals, there were laughs and high fives and it was all just a good time, but then one of our guys, a radio astronomer, decided to look into the signals. I remember when he came into my office. He had a look on his face, the kind you get when you know you have to spill the beans on something but you're scared of what'll happen to you if you do. He came to me, sat in the chair across from my desk and stared at the floor in front of him. Let me tell you, that lunatic sat in cold silence for a solid ten minutes, breathing real slow while I typed away at my computer waiting for him to gather his nerve against whatever had him so on edge. I knew his dad from back in high school and the kid was bright but always a bit of a nut, so I just let him be while I answered some e-mails, figured it was n't any big deal to me. But after a bit, I broke the ice for him. I said something like `` I've been hearing some funny things about that LES1.'' He seemed to tense up a bit but I kept pushing. `` A couple guys down in astronautical ran the numbers on the thing's movement based on the paths of all other bodies it would have come across. Apparently, they are n't able to track it back to even approximately were we lost it.''

The LES1 stopped transmitting due to a launch error causing an unstable orbit, so if we'd had more information about its trajectory, we might have predicted its return. That wasn't the surprising part, though. The unexpected element was what accompanied the return. Initially, the signals were met with laughs and high fives, just a fun moment, but then a radio astronomer among us decided to analyze them further. I recall when he entered my office, looking like he\u2019d uncovered something unsettling. His expression was tense, as if he was anxious about sharing news that might expose him to consequences. He sat across from me and stared at the floor, silent for ten long minutes, breathing slowly while I continued typing at my computer, giving him time to muster the courage to speak. I'd known his father from high school and always regarded him as bright but quirky. So, I waited patiently. Eventually, I broke the ice, saying, \"I've heard some intriguing things about that LES1.\" He seemed to tense, but I continued, \"A few guys in the astronautics department ran some calculations on its trajectory considering all other celestial bodies it might have encountered.

Yet, its transmission had ceased due to a launch mishap, sending it into an unstable orbit. With more data on its trajectory, perhaps its reappearance wouldn't have been such a curveball. But really, the unexpected part lay elsewhere. What got us truly scratching our heads came next. At first, those signal blips were cause for a few chuckles and celebratory high fives. It was just a quirky event until one curious radio astronomer got sucked into the mystery and decided to pore over them more carefully. I still vividly recall the day he showed up at my office.

Gabe squinted as the elevator doors opened again, sliding his glasses back into his breast pocket. It always took a few moments to adjust to the lighting in the Governor of Development \u2019 s office, but things seemed particularly brighter today. As always, Gabe focused on the figure in the middle of it all and soldiered forward, undeterred. There was business to attend to. The Governor turned, smiling the same warm smile that she had greeted him with on his first day. While most would have expected a man in her position, the Governor had always been content to defy those expectations, being all things to all people; cordial and familiar with everyone, and close with but a few. The consensus around the factory was that she looked like Angela Bassett, but in a private moment years ago she had confided in Gabe that it was the other way around. No matter.

Now, only the silence lingered, broken by the shuffle of an old man fulfilling the last of his duties.

Gabe eyed the elevator, its doors invitingly ajar, and selected the familiar ascent to the seventh floor\u2014the executive suite. In better days, he might have opted for the stairs for a bit of exercise, but he had to admit he no longer had the stamina. Much like the venerable old factory itself, he was ready for some repose. As he extracted his glasses, he balanced them on his nose with a careful hand, avoiding the lopsided look they tended to have otherwise. The message was straightforward, succinct\u2014work he once might have shirked, far removed from his usual sector, but as the one tasked to herald the end of operations, such minutiae had fallen into his lap. When the elevator doors opened with a mechanical whisper, Gabe slipped his glasses back into the safety of his breast pocket. It always took him a beat to adapt to the blazing brightness of the Governor of Development's office; today, it seemed even brighter than usual.

She carried herself with a grace that led many in the factory to say she reminded them of Angela Bassett, though she had once confided to Gabe, in a quieter time, that it was actually the reverse.

If you have any questions, forget about them, because this is a guided tour and your questions wo n't make any sense. Yes, I meant that, I'm not being funny. We are standing currently at the entrance of this individual's mind. As many of you can already tell, it's a male, well done on you. For those interested, you will see the overall picture from here, he does *not* think about sexual intercourse every seven seconds. He thinks about it every so often. Over to the left, you have Friendship Valley. Why is it a valley? What did I say about questions? Anyways, you can see from here that it has high walls, protected on a constant basis and it is *not* a prison. It's a uptopia for all the thoughts of the mind reserved for his closest friends. As we continue, directly ahead of us is the main thinking cortex. It's powerful, but it's not clever. Intelligence is relative ma'am, just like your face. Some may think you beautiful, but people are allowed to be *wrong*. You will notice that the storage area is large and has already been divided into several important sections. Notice that *Adventure Time* is becoming a permanent part of this storage and is currently under construction. Coming up on our left, you will see the Spite and Anger, Fear and Distrust part of the individual's mind. Of course it's large, have you seen what's on the internet? Makes your blood boil. It's storage unit for images and videos is fairly small, but we all make mistakes by focusing on one specific moment, do n't we all? Question? Well, I do n't have an answer. Onto the next portion! Here we have the creativity filter and thought process creation. It look complex, but if you look at the diagram, then you'll discover it's rather simple. No ma'am, again, no questions. Nor do I have the time or crayons to describe this for you. One of the things that is currently on this individual's mind is writing out stories, specifically on a typewriter. But since he does n't want to appear hipster, he's going for a pretentious gamer look with a mechanical keyboard, colored like a toy. An interesting exhibit indeed. Oh! And look! You can see the latest thing this individual is working on! It's a short story about describing the inner parts of your mind. Who knows? Maybe he took the prompt a little bit too literally, but I think we can all imagine that it's bound to fail. Next! The last exhibit.", "text_ai_base": "Hello everyone!

We are currently standing at the entrance of this person's mind. As many of you might have guessed, this mind belongs to a male, so kudos to you. Now, for those interested, you'll notice that despite common myths, he does *not* think about sexual matters every seven seconds. Instead, he thinks about them occasionally. To our left is Friendship Valley. Why is it called a valley? Remember what I said about questions? In any case, you can see that it boasts high protective walls, though it's not a prison. It's actually an utopia for the thoughts reserved for his closest friends. Moving ahead, we have what is known as the main thinking cortex. It's powerful but not necessarily clever. Remember that intelligence is subjective, ma'am, much like beauty\u2014a matter of opinion, allowing room for error. You'll see that the storage area is extensive and organized into key sections. Note that *Adventure Time* is becoming a permanent fixture here and is currently under development. To our left, we have the sections dealing with Spite and Anger, Fear and Distrust. Obviously, it\u2019s substantial; just consider the online world\u2014truly infuriating.

Here is the creativity filter and thought creation area. It may seem intricate, but upon reviewing the diagram, you'll find it straightforward. No questions, ma'am, and unfortunately, I lack both the time and crayons to explain further. Something currently occupying this individual's mind is story writing, particularly using a typewriter. Though he's avoiding the hipster label, opting instead for a pretentious gamer aesthetic with a toy-colored mechanical keyboard. Quite an intriguing display, indeed! Oh, and look! The latest endeavor\u2014a short story exploring the mind's inner workings\u2014is right here.

If you've guessed this mind belongs to a male, pat yourselves on the back! Commonly tossed-around myths would have you believe he's fixated on certain thoughts every seven seconds\u2014about sex, of course. In reality, those thoughts appear only occasionally.

He might not want the \"hipster\" tag, aiming instead for a gamer vibe with a splashy mechanical keyboard. It's quite a sight!

It was simple enough. He would burst in, I would shoot the rope, she would fall, he would leap over and save her, inches away from the saws, in the meantime, sending me over the edge just above the saws with this convenient rope trap I set up below my feet. On cue, the hero appeared. Shot fired, hero saved girl, villain dangling from ceiling. The perfect ending. Except for what happened next. He gloated. The hero does n't gloat! Something's wrong here! He raised his spear, and uttered a death threat. Kill me? But what about our back and forth? The game is n't a game when someone refuses to play by the rules. The hero thrust forward, as I pulled myself upwards on the rope, the spear missing, but the hero falling off balance and falling into the deathtrap below. I'd won, right?

The first thing I did was gasp for air, which was something I'd never thought I'd do again when I felt the life leaving my body. It the most unique breath I'd ever taken though, I did n't remember breathing feeling quite like this, and it took me a few more moments of hard panting to figure out why.

For thousands of years, I resisted... but the ivory horse's whispers were irresistibly sweet. Ultimately, it drove me insane. Millennia after entering the cave, I succumbed and picked up the horse.

War and combat weren\u2019t in my blood. The others rushed in, eager eyes fixed on the legendary armaments, each possessing a storied past and unique soul. Every piece of weaponry had seen countless battles, some passing readily from hand to hand, while others sat in silent judgment, taking on masters only in dire times or choosing rare souls marked by destiny. The most eager among us snatched the simple weapons without a second thought. Trying to mirror their fervor, I lunged for the Scythe of Fortune, a tool famed for its ability to halve the time to reap harvests. It slipped through my fingers as if it were nothing but a mirage. Others, sons of farmers like me, made their attempts too, but met the same fate. We tried the Horn of Plenty and the Bottomless Vessel, casting anxious glances at each other when they too denied us. Concern etched into our faces, the shadow of a poor harvest loomed. Weapons of destruction found their new bearers among those left. My younger brother caught sight of a small black horse carving and, mistaking it for a trinket meant for playing, clasped it before I could intervene. As for us older three, we knew the truth\u2014the horse carvings were more than mere tokens. None of the weapons chose us, leaving the small horses that none dared. Benji, under pressure, scooped up the red horse shyly, tucking it away. Two remained. Paeter, drawn in, took the next; an unsettling allure eventually consumed him, compelling a fiery transformation. He left us, a wild shadow of himself, adorned with a pale green ribbon\u2014a stark contrast to the fierce but kind gaze he cast over his shoulder, bow in hand, like a parting gesture. Haunted, I spent years in search of weapons that continued to reject me, until at last, desperation led me to embrace the plague arrow deep into my chest. Strangely, death evaded me. Centuries rolled on, absent were the children meant to fill the hall and claim its relics. Isolation wore on me. Wrapped in loneliness for millennia, I resisted and resisted... yet the ivory horse called with a siren song too sweet to ignore. In the end, it whittled away my sanity, and I succumbed, taking the horse into my grasp. Now, my essence gallops alongside that pale specter, finding my siblings waiting astride their own spectral steeds.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

She looked at me with such disgust that I felt shame. It was n't an overly dramatic look, but it was a look that said alot. A look that as her son, I have seen many times. Every time it breaks me. Tears me to shreads inside. You'd think by now I'd be use to it, would have built up some type of tolerance or indifference to it. nope. `` What are you doing in here? Sometimes I wonder how you'd survive once you leave this house.'' she spat up at me. `` Dad wanted to know if you're going to have dinner with us..'' She laughed. But it wasnt warm like it used to be. She always gets dark when she's working on her mysterious hobbies in the basement. She broods and becomes highly irritable when interrupted. She returns to her work without saying a word. But she's said everything. She's told me she'd rather be here on her hobby then up eating as a family with us. fine, fuck her than. Sulking I storm up the staircase. All I want is for that bitch to stop being so fucking bi-polar and act how she did before she got caught up with her old hobbies again. Eat at the dinner table like a normal family. Eyes watering a bit, i rub them with my arm in protest of displaying my emotions. Barging into the kitchen, I miss seeing the knife holder onto the edge of the bench. I turn in my mood and accidentally send them flying. oh god.. It's like time froze or at least it almost did. Knives swim through the air on a direct path to my dad. The best dad in the world. I think how could such a loving father ever fall in love with that creature in the basement. My heart beats dangerously at my chest in panic. Then it happened. My dad's eyes caught a glimpse of his death, and then he was... I do n't know how to describe it. It was elegant, like he was dancing. But it was beautiful, almost ethereal. He danced around and between the knives like time was insignificant to him. Even bigger I realised I could see this all, how could I see time slow down and him move through them. Knives clatter onto the floor behind my father. Standing in silence we look at each other. I stand in awe. He stares back in... fear? Realisation crashes over me. My father is The Blur. OH MY GOD MY WONDERFUL FATHER IS A HERO TO OTHERS!", "text_ai_base": "\"Mum?\" I broke the silence, my voice heavy with desperation. The word hung in the space between us. She looked at me with such disdain that shame washed over me. It wasn't overly dramatic, but her expression said a lot\u2014an expression I, as her son, had seen many times. Each time it shattered me, tearing me apart inside. You'd think by now I'd have grown used to it, developed some kind of tolerance or indifference. But no. \"What are you doing in here? Sometimes I wonder how you'll cope once you leave this house,\" she snapped at me. \"Dad wanted to know if you're joining us for dinner...\" She laughed, but it lacked the warmth it used to have. She always turns dark when she's immersed in her mysterious basement projects. She broods and becomes irritable when interrupted. Without another word, she returned to her work, yet she had communicated everything. Her actions said she'd rather be engaged in her hobby than dining with us as a family. Fine, forget her then. I stormed up the stairs, sulking. All I wanted was for her to stop being so unpredictable and return to how she was before these old hobbies consumed her. To eat at the dinner table like a normal family. My eyes stinging a bit, I wiped them with my arm, refusing to let my emotions show. Barging into the kitchen, I didn't notice the knife holder teetering on the edge of the counter. In my mood, I accidentally knocked it over. Oh God... it was like time slowed down. Knives sailed through the air, heading directly toward my dad\u2014the best dad in the world. How could such a loving man fall for that woman in the basement? Panic hammered in my chest. Then it happened. My dad caught a glimpse of the danger, and his movements were... indescribable. It was like a dance\u2014graceful and almost otherworldly. He navigated through the knives as if time held no sway over him. Even more astonishing was my ability to witness it all\u2014how could I see time slow down and him move so effortlessly? The knives clattered to the floor behind him. In silence, we stared at one another. I stood in awe. He gazed back in... fear? Understanding swept over me. My father was The Blur.

The word lingered awkwardly in the air. Her eyes met mine with a look that spoke volumes, a disdain I knew all too well. The sight of it was enough to make shame flood over me. I should\u2019ve been used to this by now, immune to her silent judgments, but they still tore me apart inside like the first time. \"What are you doing in here? Sometimes I wonder how you\u2019ll manage once you\u2019re out of this house,\" she said, a sharp edge to her words. \"Dad wanted to know if you're joining us for dinner\u2026\" she added, her laugh devoid of the warmth it once held. She always gets this way when she\u2019s knee-deep in her basement projects, turning dark and irritable if anyone dares interrupt her. With a turn of her back, she went back to her work, leaving me with all the unspoken words echoing in my mind. Clearly, her hobby took precedence over a family dinner. Fine then, let her be. I stormed up the stairs, trying to swallow my frustration. More than anything, I wished she'd drop this enigmatic obsession of hers and just be there with us again. To share a meal like families are supposed to. Blinking back the sting in my eyes, I wiped them with my arm, determined to show no trace of my frazzled emotions. Charging into the kitchen, I didn\u2019t notice that the knife holder was precariously balanced at the edge of the counter. In my hasty mood, I accidentally brushed it over. Suddenly, chaos erupted\u2014a hundred slow-motion moments unfurling all at once. The knives seemed to float through the air, aimed squarely at Dad. That wonderful man\u2014how did he end up with someone like her tucked away downstairs? Panic pounded in my chest. And then, there it was. Dad moved with a kind of elegance that defied belief, a seamless grace I'd never associated with him before. He ducked and sidestepped as if time itself bent to his will. It was astonishing, like witnessing a dance slowed to a dreamlike pace. And how could I see it all happen like this, time stretching out around us? As the knives clattered harmlessly to the floor, he looked at me. We stood locked in a moment of shared understanding. Awe-struck, I realized\u2014my dad is The Blur.

We were like two peas in a pod, we went everywhere and did everything together, this birthday party was no exception. `` Yes.'' I replied, `` I'm really looking forward to my cake. My Aunt made it. It's her special triple chocolate layer cake.'' Sam's eyes widened and eyebrows raised just a bit. `` Oh, sweet! Your Aunt makes the best cakes. Her bakery is the talk of the town.'' I could tell Sam was excited. Sam also loved chocolate cake, just like me. As we walked down the sidewalk towards the party, the cool fall wind brushed against my arms. I was only wearing a T-shirt. I guess my mom was right, maybe I should have wore a jacket when I left for school this morning. `` So...'' said Sam, then after a short pause hesitantly and nervously continued, `` How do you think you did on Ms. Mori's math test today?'' Ms. Mori was our 7th grade math teacher. She was nice and pretty smart, but her exams were n't exactly a cake walk. I could tell Sam did n't think the test today was easy. `` Eh, alright.'' I replied. `` I think'x' equaled 12, and 12 - 12 is 0. So, I think the final answer was zero.'' Sam kinda just stared forward, `` Oh, I guess I just could n't make the connection.'' Sam replied, mind drifting. I guess he was thinking about something else. But that's when it happened, and it happened so fast. At that moment we were no longer on the side walk, but rather in the middle of the cross walk and crossing the street. There was a red car, going three times faster then it should have been going on this quiet suburban street. Sam's mind was still drifting. He did n't see it coming. I pushed Sam forward, out of the crosswalk and onto the sidewalk. No car was getting my best friend today. At least not while I was alive and kicking. Slowly, Sam's screaming faded into silence, and as the doctor slapped my ass, a new screaming filled the room. I could see my mother's smile. Her face glowed like that of any mother of a new born baby. And once again, I was back at the beginning. This time I was only sent 12 years into the past.

Her bakery is famous around town.\" Sam\u2019s enthusiasm was clear; he loved chocolate cake as much as I did. As we walked towards the party, a cool fall breeze brushed against my arms. I regretted not wearing a jacket, though Mom had advised me to wear one before leaving for school. \"So\u2026\" Sam began, then after a brief pause continued hesitantly, \"How do you think you did on Ms. Mori\u2019s math test today?\" Ms. Mori was our seventh-grade math teacher, kind and smart, but her tests weren't easy. Sam seemed uncertain about how he did. \"Alright,\" I said, \"I figured 'x' was 12, and 12 minus 12 is zero. So, I think the answer was zero.\" Sam stared ahead, \"Oh, I didn\u2019t make that connection,\" he admitted, his thoughts elsewhere. But suddenly, things changed. While crossing the street in the crosswalk, a red car sped towards us, far faster than it should have moved down our quiet suburban street. Sam was distracted and didn\u2019t notice it. I quickly shoved him forward, out of harm's way onto the sidewalk. No car was going to take my best friend today\u2014not while I was around. As Sam\u2019s shouting faded, another cry filled the air: the doctor\u2019s slap echoing off a newborn as my mother beamed with pride. Her face glowed like any new mother\u2019s would. And I was back at the start, reincarnated into my 12-year-old self.

Not just any cake, but the iconic triple chocolate layer one my Aunt bakes. You could see Sam\u2019s excitement ripple through him as his eyes went wide; he had a known penchant for chocolate cake, especially hers. \"Your Aunt\u2019s cakes are legendary,\" he exclaimed, \"Everyone in town knows her bakery.\" As we ambled toward the festivities, the cool autumn air teased my skin. I mentally kicked myself for ignoring Mom\u2019s advice about the jacket\u2014she\u2019d been right again. Breaking the comfortable silence, Sam ventured into less celebratory territory, \"So, uh\u2026 how do you reckon you did on Ms. Mori's math test?\" His hesitance was almost palpable. Ms. Mori, our seventh-grade math whiz of a teacher, never made tests easy, even with her kind demeanor. \u201cI think I did alright,\" I mused aloud. \"I figured out that \u2018x\u2019 was 12, and 12 minus 12 gives zero, so that made sense as the answer.\u201d Sam furrowed his brow, clearly struggling to piece it together, then conceded, \u201cI missed that.\u201d As if out of nowhere, the humdrum of our conversation shattered. While crossing the street, a red car barrelled towards us\u2014the driver must have been oblivious to how fast they were going in our hushed little neighborhood. Sam, lost in thought, hadn\u2019t noticed. Instinct took over as I shoved him to safety. Not today, not my friend. A life spared. And then, like the twist of a story only half-believable, there was the sound of a newborn\u2019s cry jolting me back. I was reliving the echo of a doctor\u2019s slap and my mother\u2019s radiant joy as she welcomed me\u2014a new beginning wrapped in old familiarity.

Maybe we should poke it with something. Like a stick or something and see what happens? \u201d \u201c Ok! \u201d Marlow began looking for a stick or something to poke it with. As he was searching, Brian continued to stare at the strange point in space. It wasn \u2019 t moving, but it seemed to have something inside of it moving. Brian was afraid to get too close to this particular point in space, for fear that it would electrocute him. Brian was paranoid of being electrocuted. \u201c I got a stick. Here! Poke it! \u201d Marlow said. \u201c Why me? You have the stick, you poke it. \u201d \u201c Jesus, Brian, what the hell are you afraid of? It \u2019 s just a particular point in space. It doesn \u2019 t even seem to be moving. Poke it and see if it moves! What are you scared of? \u201d Brian remembered the last time someone had goaded him into poking something. It was years ago, when he was much younger. His schoolmates teased him, and called him all sorts of names, until he crumbled under the peer pressure, and went ahead with the poking. Since then, Brian had a subtle phobia of light sockets. He still has nightmares about light switches, electrical cords, and high tension wires. \u201c Listen buddy! There \u2019 s no way in hell I \u2019 m going to poke this thing. If you want to see what happens when you poke it, then YOU poke it. In fact, I think you \u2019 re a coward if you don \u2019 t poke it! \u201d Brian thought about this statement, and deep in the back of his mind, he felt guilty for calling his friend names for not poking something. Brian looked at Marlow and apologized. \u201c I \u2019 m sorry. You \u2019 re not a coward. Maybe we could throw something at it instead? \u201d Marlow laughed, and plunged the stick forward into the strange, peculiar, particular, point in space. A small flicker of light, a loud pop, and an arc of electricity zapped Marlow through the branch. Brian and Marlow smelled burnt arm hair. \u201c It electrocuted me! \u201d shouted Marlow, \u201c Man, that hurt! But like\u2026 what a rush, ya know? Scary, but it almost felt good! You want to try? \u201d Marlow offered the stick to Brian. Brian shook his head. \u201c OK then, I \u2019 m going to poke it again! \u201d Marlow reached in for the second time, and again was zapped by this particular point in space. \u201c WOW!", "text_ai_base": "\"Did you touch it?\" \"Of course not! Did you?\" \"Definitely not. Maybe we should poke it with something, like a stick, to see what happens.\" \"Okay!\" Marlow began scanning the area for a suitable stick. Meanwhile, Brian kept his gaze fixed on the strange point in space. It wasn't moving, yet something seemed to stir within it. Worried about getting too close, Brian feared it might electrocute him. He harbored a deep fear of electric shocks. \"I found a stick. Here! You poke it!\" Marlow said. \u201cWhy should I? You have the stick, so you poke it.\u201d \"Come on, Brian, what are you so scared of? It\u2019s just a point in space. It doesn't even move. Just poke it and see! What are you afraid of?\" Marlow insisted. Brian recalled the last time someone pushed him into poking something. It was years ago when he was younger. His classmates had teased him relentlessly until he caved under the pressure. Ever since, he'd developed a subtle fear of electrical outlets. Even now, he dreams about light switches and power cords. \"Listen, there's no way I'm poking that thing. If you want to do it, then go ahead. And I think you're chicken if you don\u2019t!\" Brian reflected on his harsh words and felt a pang of guilt. He turned to Marlow, apologizing. \"I'm sorry. You're not a coward. Maybe we could throw something at it instead?\" Marlow chuckled and thrust the stick toward the peculiar spot. At once, there was a small flash, a loud pop, and a jolt of electricity ran through Marlow via the branch. The air filled with the smell of burnt hair. \"It shocked me!\" Marlow yelled, \"Wow, that hurt! But, strangely, it felt kind of exciting. Want to try?\" He offered the stick to Brian, who shook his head. \"Alright then, I'm going for round two!\" Marlow reached in again and was zapped by the mysterious point in space once more. \"WOW!\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"Did you touch it?\" Brian's voice held a note of disbelief. \"Of course not! Did you?\" Marlow countered quickly, eyes wide with innocence. \"Definitely not. Maybe we should poke it with something\u2014like, I don't know, a stick\u2014to test what happens.\" With that, Marlow began scanning the ground for a suitable stick, all while Brian couldn't tear his gaze from the eerie point suspended in space. Although the point remained unmoving, something inside it seemed to quiver. Brian, having a deep-seated fear of electric shocks, worried about getting too close; he didn\u2019t fancy the idea of being electrocuted. \"I found a stick.\" Marlow announced triumphantly, waving it in the air. \"Here, you poke it!\" he said\u2014perhaps with a touch too much eagerness. \"Why should I? You found it, so you poke it,\" Brian deflected immediately, an involuntary shiver running up his spine. \"Come on, Brian, really? It's just a weird point in the air. Doesn't even move. What are you afraid of?\" Marlow pushed. It brought back memories for Brian\u2014the haunting recollection of the time he\u2019d been coerced into poking something years ago by merciless classmates, who mocked him until he broke down. That experience had planted an irrational fear of electrical outlets deep within him. Even now, those nightmares occasionally haunted him: flickering dreams of light switches and tangled power cords. \"Listen, there's no way I'm poking that thing. If you want to do it, then feel free. And I think you're the chicken if you don't!\" Brian retorted, feeling an instant pang of regret when the words tumbled out. He turned to Marlow, his expression softening. \"Sorry, that was out of line. Maybe we could throw something at it instead?\" Marlow just smiled, amused by the situation more than affronted. With a daring spark in his eye, Marlow jabbed the stick towards the peculiar point. Suddenly, without warning, a small flash blossomed followed by a loud pop, as a jolt of electricity coursed through Marlow like a lightning bolt via the wooden branch. The distinct odor of singed hair hung in the air. \"It shocked me!\" Marlow exclaimed, both startled and oddly thrilled. \"Wow, that was intense! Want to try?\" He extended the stick towards Brian, whose head shook in firm refusal. \"Alright then, I\u2019m diving in for round two!\" With a laugh, Marlow went for it again, receiving another electrifying zap from the mysterious spot. \"WOW!\"", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

Another car arrived and parked beside the house. From the vehicle emerged a figure resembling a human male, carrying a box. He walked to the door and rang the bell. Inside was another human male, and the view switched to show the interior perspective. \"Did someone order a pizza?\" asked the man holding the box. \"A pizza?\" the captain repeated incredulously, turning to his second-in-command with a look of annoyance. \"Please, sir,\" urged the android, gesturing towards the screen. \"You're about to see the discrepancy.\" The captain turned back just in time to witness the two men embracing and kissing, with the pizza now absent. Feltch was captivated by the scene. \"Android 18, is it that week on this planet?\" he asked as the men quickly began undressing in a frenzy. \"Surprisingly, no, Captain,\" replied the android. \"Such carnal displays are common here and not limited by mating cycles.

Right on cue, another car appeared, pulling into the driveway. Out popped a figure, looking every bit the part of a classic human male, carrying a box. He ambled over to the front steps and gave the bell a ring. Inside the house, another man awaited, and the scene morphed to an interior shot. \"Did someone here call for a pizza?\" the new arrival asked, gesturing to the box.

The captain turned his gaze back to the screen right as the pair\u2014no longer strangers\u2014were locked in a heartfelt embrace, the pizza now a mere shrug of an object. Intrigued, Feltch asked, \"Android 18, is this the scheduled mating period for this planet?\" as the duo on screen shed their clothing with a speed that would bedazzle. \"Actually, no, Captain,\" the android responded in a tone hinting at both surprise and insight. \"This sort of physical interaction is startlingly common here, not dictated by cycles.

Everyday seems to bleed into the next a constant flow of labcoats into the bunker. I am curious to see what is happening in there, for no other reason than to sate my thirst for a change in scenery.

We're identified only by numbers; I'm Fifty. It's business as usual. We're equipped with cutting-edge gear: S-343 power suits with full monitoring add-ons, enhancing our reaction time and boosting our strength proportionally. Makes simple tasks like taking a piss potentially hazardous. Our primary weapon, the Phase 3 PulseRifle, packs enough power to conquer a small nation. Our sidearm is an S22 ballistic pistol, accompanied by three concussion grenades and an EMP. The helmet is a comprehensive life support system, sufficient for survival in the harshest conditions for 72 hours. Despite all this, the relentless cold persists\u2014I've never been fond of the biting chill of science. Everything's provided and maintained by IMS, a bit excessive for a mere wallflower role if you ask me. I'd be content with my leather gear and a simple 12-gauge shotgun.

This might seem like a relatively common pass time to you for a teenager in the 80's, but while everyone else would get shooed away by the owners, threats of calling the police getting rid of the more stubborn of loiterers, I would stay. Not because I was a rebel, not because I was trying to act cool for anyone, it's just that I was allowed to. For my entire life I have been allowed to loiter as much as I want, my best friend is allowed as many offenses of battery as he wants and his wife is luckily a masochist that is allowed to abuse drugs, but I'm the only person I know that is allowed the freedom to stand around anywhere I want to without consequences. No one can tell me to get off of their property and, as far as I'm concerned, all property is my property to an extent. I make my living by loitering in the doorways of secured places, places like banks or prisons, and letting other people in and out. Legal robbers will pay me to let them into stores and banks and illegal robbers will pay me to let them out of prison.

Unlike other kids who were frequently shooed away by the mall owners or faced threats of police intervention, I always stayed. It wasn't because I was a rebel or trying to impress anyone; I simply had the privilege to remain there. Throughout my life, I've enjoyed the freedom to loiter without consequences. My best friend racks up countless battery offenses, and his wife, fortunately a masochist, is free to abuse drugs. Yet, I'm the only person who can linger wherever I please without repercussions. No one can order me off their property, and as I see it, all property is essentially mine in some way. I earn a living by hanging around secured locations, such as banks or prisons, facilitating entry and exit for others. Legal robbers pay me to unlock stores and banks for them, while illegal ones pay me to help them escape from prison.

My existence has been marked, curiously, by an ability to loiter without consequences. Consider my best friend\u2014constantly brushing up against the law with numerous battery charges, while his wife's penchant for dangerous substances sails unchecked due to her masochistic tendencies. Yet, here I am, standing freely, a figure able to occupy spaces and claim them as my own, as if I possess a key to every door. Earning my keep involves mingling around high-security locales: banks, prisons\u2014you name it. My role is unique; I help people navigate these secured environments, whether it's letting them in or aiding in their escape. The job's odd nature means that 'legal' thieves pay me to unlock stores, while those on the wrong side of the law might pay me for a hasty prison exit. It's bizarre, and sometimes it gets a bit dark.

I opened the door and stepped out into the rain, into the darkness, where the only light for miles in any direction were my headlights. Our town was a small town with a size of around five thousand people. Here, you'd suspect that everyone would know everyone else, but even our community had its `` cliques,'' our own circles of friends. Sure, people would recognize and greet each other as we passed by, but talk to each other? Not really. So when someone struggles silently, they struggle here just as they would anywhere -- nobody cares. It was half past midnight, so the fields outside our town were dark, and everyone inside our town were asleep, all their lights shut off. He flinched at the sound of my voice, although I'm certain he must've seen my headlights coming back into town. `` What are you doing?'' ``...'' I slowly walked towards him, not even bothering to close the door behind me. `` Mister --'' I began, but my foot kicked something along the ground. It was a tipped-over pill bottle, with some of its little contents spilling out. Even in the dark, I could tell it was a new bottle. `` Mister, can you just... can you just step back over here and we can talk about it?'' I spoke softly, making sure to not startle him again, as I quietly approached him from behind. He did n't bother turning around. `` No, I'm fine right here.'' His voice was cold, steady, and certain of what he was going to do. I knew I had to choose my words wisely. `` Mind if I sit with you?'' He shook his head. I kicked off my heals and looked over the bridge. Vertigo immediately overtook me, but I closed my eyes and breathed deeply before taking a seat beside him. `` So, um, what are you doing here?'' I asked again. He did n't reply. We sat there silently, listening to the rain splatter on the ground behind us. Moments turned to minutes, and minutes felt like hours, just sitting on the edge of death, together. `` Knock knock.'' A confused look washed over his face, which was better than the stoicity it had for the past hour. ``... what?'' he asked, turning to face me. `` Knock knock,'' I repeated. I could feel him looking at my face for what seemed like eternity, before he replied, `` Who's there?'' `` Orange.'' The corner of his lip turned up. `` Orange who?'' I turned to him. `` Orange you glad I'm here?'' I said with a smile, reaching up to poke his nose like a button.", "text_ai_base": "\"Wait!\" I swung the door open and stepped into the rain, enveloped by darkness, where the only light for miles around came from my headlights. Our town, home to about five thousand people, had an intimate size suggesting that everyone would know each other. Yet, we had our own \"cliques,\" distinct circles of friends. People might acknowledge each other with a nod or a greeting, but meaningful conversation? Rarely. So, anyone struggling in silence here suffers much like anywhere else \u2014 unnoticed. It was half past midnight, leaving the fields surrounding town shrouded in darkness, while everyone in town was asleep, their lights extinguished. He flinched at my voice, even though he must've noticed my headlights returning to town. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. His silence was my only reply as I approached him, not bothering to close the door behind me. \"Mister\u2014\" I began, but my foot hit something. A tipped-over pill bottle lay on the ground, its contents spilling out, which was clearly new. \"Mister, could you just... step back here so we can talk?\" I spoke gently, careful not to startle him further, and quietly approached from behind. He didn't bother turning around. \"No, I'm fine right here,\" he responded, his voice cold and resolute. Knowing I had to tread carefully, I asked, \"Mind if I sit with you?\" He shook his head. I kicked off my heels and looked over the bridge. Vertigo swept over me, but I shut my eyes and took a deep breath before seating myself beside him. \"So, um, what are you doing here?\" I asked again. Still, no reply. We sat in silence, listening to the rain splashing on the ground behind us. Minutes felt like hours as we balanced on the precipice together. \"Knock knock.\" At last, a flicker of confusion crossed his face, which was better than the stoic expression he'd held for the past hour. \"\u2026what?\" he asked, turning towards me. \"Knock knock,\" I repeated. He studied my face for what seemed like ages before responding, \"Who's there?\" \"Orange.\" A hint of a smile appeared at the corner of his lips. \"Orange who?\" I turned to him, grinning. \"Orange you glad I'm here?\" I said, playfully poking his nose like a button.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"Wait!\" I called out, my heart pounding as I swung the door open, stepping into the downpour. The night was a blanket enveloping the small town, pierced only by the faint glow of my headlights. Our little community of five thousand souls seemed like the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else. But in reality, we were more like a tapestry of separate threads, loosely intertwined. Folks exchanged polite nods or cursory greetings, yet meaningful conversations? Those were a rarity. One could easily suffer in silence here, just like anywhere else. It was just past midnight. Darkness clung to the fields on the edge of town, like the sleeping shadows of the townsfolk who lay dreaming with the lights out. I saw him then, flinching as if my headlights had startled him back to life. \"What are you doing out here?\" I called, my voice trying not to betray the nervous flutter in my chest. Silence wrapped around his frame as I approached, leaving the car door wide open behind me to the chorus of raindrops. \"Mister\u2014\" I began, and then my foot connected with something hard and small. I glanced down to see a pill bottle, its contents scattered like secrets in the rain. A chill ran up my spine. \"Mister, could you come over here, please? Maybe we can talk?\" My words came out soft, the rain almost swallowing them, but I hoped he heard the care in them. He stood there, unmoved, not even bothering to turn around. \"No, I'm fine right here,\" came his cold, clipped reply, sending a fresh wave of concern through me. I knew I had to be gentle. \"Mind if I sit with you?\" I asked, hoping to bridge the gap. He shook his head, not objecting but not inviting either. I slipped off my heels, feeling the wet grass between my toes, and peered over the bridge railing. A dizzying drop met my gaze, so I quickly shut my eyes, taking a calming breath before settling beside him. \"So, um, here in the rain... what's going on?\" I ventured again, but silence was his chosen companion. And so, we sat, the rain providing the only soundtrack, my heart echoing its rhythm. Time stretched thin between us until it felt like an eternity. \"Knock knock.\" My words, unexpected even to me, broke the silence. His impassive mask showed the slightest crack of surprise. \"\u2026what?\" he finally asked, glancing sidelong at me. \"Knock knock,\" I repeated, trying to lighten the air. He took a moment, searching my face for clues, before playing along. \"Who's there?\" he asked. \"Orange,\" I said. I noticed, just barely, a twitch at the corner of his lips. \"Orange who?\" he responded, a question marking the first hint of warmth. \"Orange you glad I'm here?\" I quipped, grinning as I playfully tapped his nose.

I have started to make a trust fund so that i can visit you someday, and if you could donate to it ( even just a little ) it would help my dream become glorious reality. Love, Achike Abasad, Prince of Nigeria I was furious when I received the email. I had just posted a picture on my Facebook page of my cousin and I together at a beach in California. This `` Prince'', this scammer, had clearly been looking through my personal page and tried to use my cousin against me, staining my memory of the beautiful California sun on my back. Had he *really* thought that I would n't ask my cousin before I gave him *any* money? So though my better judgement advised against extending the interaction, I sent him an angry email in return. He responded. Ms. Lianne, You have discovered me. I am a poor scammer working out of a crumbling office in Nigeria, and the only way I could contact you was through a scam.

Please let me video message you during work. It is strictly forbidden, but it is the only way I can think of to convince you of my good intentions. Love, Achike Abasad, Email Scammer Before I continue, I should tell you that I am an exquisitely lonely person. I inherited my wealth. I fill my time ordering from the pages of Skymall and ladies' magazines. To find interest in me outside of my money or familial connections was intriguing, and the invitation was too good to ignore. I turned on the computer and submitted an invitation to talk through our webcams. He accepted immediately. I saw a set of crooked white teeth smiling before he leaned back from the camera and allowed me to see his whole face. His cheeks were hollow and concave and his hair was lank, but despite this I could see the seeds of attraction. He opened his mouth to speak, but before he did, a nasal voice spoke in heavily accented English from the background. `` You have n't messaged the rich woman yet? You always were the best in the business, Achike. Having the smart to sell her that love symbol garbage- inspired.", "text_ai_base": "Dear Ms. Lianne, You are truly beautiful. My friend, who is also your cousin, always mentioned it, but she never quite captured the way your curly brown hair falls across your radiant eyes. I am fifth in line for the Nigerian throne and dream of meeting you one day. I've begun saving to make this possible and would be grateful for any contribution you could make, no matter how small. Your help would turn my dream into a glorious reality. Love, Achike Abasad, Prince of Nigeria When I received this email, I was livid. I had just posted a picture on Facebook of my cousin and me at a beach in California. This so-called \"Prince,\" clearly a scammer, had been snooping through my personal page and was attempting to use my cousin to manipulate me, tainting my memory of the sunny California beach. Did he *really* think I wouldn't consult my cousin before giving him *any* money? Despite my better judgment warning against further contact, I fired off a furious reply. He responded: Ms. Lianne, You've uncovered my secret. I am a struggling scammer working from a dilapidated office in Nigeria, and this scam was my only way to reach you. However, my feelings for you and my desire to meet you are genuine. You represent the love I've never received, and the luxury I've been denied. Please allow me to video chat with you during work hours. It's strictly forbidden, but it's the only way I can prove my honest intentions. Love, Achike Abasad, Email Scammer Before I proceed, I should mention that I am profoundly lonely. I inherited my wealth and spend my time shopping from Skymall and ladies' magazines. The prospect of someone interested in me beyond my money or family connections was captivating, and I couldn't resist the invitation. I powered on my computer and sent him a request for a webcam chat. He accepted right away. As the call connected, I saw a set of crooked teeth smiling before he leaned back, revealing his full face. His hollow cheeks and lank hair contrasted with the slight attraction I felt. As he began to speak, a nasal voice with a thick accent interrupted from the background: \"You haven't messaged the rich woman yet? You were always the best, Achike.

An encounter would be unforgettable, and I\u2019ve started saving to make it happen; any contribution, however small, would help turn this dream into reality. Your support would transform a mere aspiration into a glorious moment. Warm regards, Achike Abasad, Prince of Nigeria When I stumbled upon this email, my blood boiled with fury. Just recently, I had shared a snapshot on Facebook featuring my cousin and me enjoying the sun-kissed shores of California. This so-called \"Prince\" had been snooping around my online life, plotting to use my cousin as a pawn in his unscrupulous scheme, tarnishing the cherished beach memories in the process. Did he expect me to simply hand over funds without checking with my cousin first? Despite my trust whispering caution, anger drove me to snap back a heated reply. His response arrived swiftly: Ms. Lianne, You\u2019ve unmasked me. I am a struggling scammer, operating out of a rundown office in Nigeria; this scheme was my shot at reaching you. Nevertheless, my feelings for you and my wish to meet are genuine. You symbolize the love that\u2019s eluded me and the luxury denied.

The chance someone might care for me beyond my money or family ties was tempting, and against better logic, I let curiosity drive my actions. With anticipation buzzing, I powered up my computer and sent a webcam chat request, to which he instantly replied. As the call connected, a crooked smile appeared, revealing a face with hollow cheeks and lank hair, contrasting the faint pull I felt. Suddenly, a nasal voice, thick with accent, intruded from somewhere off-screen: \"Still haven\u2019t messaged the rich lady, huh? You were top-notch, Achike.

Not that there is n't usually a crowd when His Holiness deigns to show himself to his people. But the everyday prayers of the leader of the Catholic Church do n't draw this kind of crowd... Dignitaries from nearly every First World Nation were in attendance. Celebrities from all walks of life were rubbing elbows with each other in what looked to be a special VIP section. But the biggest, wildest groups were the followers in the middle. There were n't just Catholics and Christians here. Several of the most important rabbis, and sheikhs and imams from the Middle East. The Dalai Lama sent a few of his most trusted monks. Even the Shinto priests had just arrived. There were MILLIONS of people in attendance, all singing and talking and crammed together in and around St. Peter's Basilica. Why, you ask? The Ark of the Covenant. It had finally been found. Now, you got ta understand. In both Christianity and Judaism, the Ark of the Covenant is a pretty big deal, right? It's supposed to contain the tablets upon which God wrote the Ten Commandments for Moses and the bones of some body or something, I do n't know the particulars... But what I DO know is, to put it mildly, the Ark's the single most important find in the history of the world. And today was the day they were going to open it. Note that I said `` supposed to be.'' This is n't a happy story, ladies and gents. Watching all the various people scurrying about, I could n't help but wonder if they knew what they were doing. Everyone knows about how the Ark is supposed to work; they even did it in Indiana Jones! If you open it, you'll die. Simple as that. There's also a lot of fluffy stuff about how religions work because they're based on faith and if you have definitive proof, yadda yadda, no one really cares okay? So the Pope's finished talking and the moment is here. The Ark is... smaller than you'd think. All the Bible stories made it out to be some massive case, adorned with gold and jewels and spiritual hullabaloo. So it was kinda surprising when this simple long box was wheeled out. Looking back, I should have known something was up. But man, it was hard not to let yourself get sucked into the moment, you know what I mean?

It's believed to hold the tablets inscribed by God for Moses and other significant relics, though I'm not sure of the details. What is clear is that the Ark is arguably the most momentous discovery ever. Today was the day they would open it. Notice I said \"supposed to be,\" because this isn't a joyous tale, my friends. Observing all the hurried activity, I wondered if anyone truly grasped the implications. Everyone knows the legend of the Ark's power; even Indiana Jones depicted it: open it, and you die. Simple as that. There's also talk about religion relying on faith, and if you have solid proof\u2014well, you get the idea. As the Pope finished speaking, the moment arrived.

It's never an empty affair when His Holiness addresses his faithful, but this gathering was exceptional; it dwarfed the usual occasions when the Catholic Church leader offers his devotions. Among the crowd were dignitaries from nearly every leading nation, mingling seamlessly with celebrities hailing from diverse fields, all nestled within what appeared to be an exclusive section. Yet, it was the fervent masses at the heart of the congregation that caught the eye. More than Catholics and Christians filled the square; influential rabbis, sheikhs, and imams journeyed from the Middle East. The Dalai Lama delegated skilled monks, and even practitioners of Shinto had arrived to witness this event. No fewer than a million souls packed the area surrounding St. Peter's Basilica, a tapestry of music, chatter, and anticipation. And why such a spectacle? Well, the Ark of the Covenant had been uncovered. Allow me to provide a bit of context\u2014the Ark bears immense significance in Christianity and Judaism. It's claimed to store tablets carved by divine decree for Moses and may hold other cherished relics; details elude me, but its importance is indisputable. We're speaking of nothing less than a discovery of monumental proportions. Today marked the moment to unveil its contents.

As frenetic preparations unfolded, I couldn't help but wonder if anyone deeply considered the potential consequences. The legend of the Ark's deadly power isn't an enigma; pop culture, not least of all Indiana Jones, entrenched it firmly into public consciousness: open it, and you're courting death, plain and simple. And then there's the notion: what happens to faith when faced with unequivocal proof? When the Pope's address concluded, anticipation was palpable. The Ark appeared, albeit puzzlingly smaller than anticipated. Scriptural tales describe it as a majestic chest lavishly adorned with gold and jewels\u2014a sight to instill awe.

We justified our murder. We learned so much, as did they. I still think about how they must have felt, going from the conquerors to feeling pain for the first time.

Wolfgang, one of the other residents, had brought it to her attention that his neighbor had not been seen since yesterday, which in such a tight knit community was cause for alarm. Isabelle's heart stuttered uncomfortably, but she reassured herself that it was most likely just a case of the sniffles. With a nod to decorum, she knocked politely as she called out, `` Kat? Kat, are you there? It's Isabelle, Wolfgang told me that you've not been out, I wanted to check in-'' At that moment the door swung inward slightly, the May sunshine streaming into a dark room. Isabelle gulped nervously, and pressed inward, determined to ensure the health of the occupant. `` I'm not sure what happened, please do n't panic, I'm completely okay Isabelle, I need you to just not freak out, okay?'' A voice blurted all of that out in the span of a few seconds, the speaker clearly worried themself. Isabelle sighed in relief, at least Kat was still there. `` I have no idea what you're talking about, where are you, it's so dark in here,'' Isabelle said idly as her paw felt the wall for the light switch. She flicked it on, and turned back to the room, only to gasp with shock and horror. Kat, who had been a pretty brown wolf villagers, was now very much pink, and very much naked. She had strange paws with very long toes, and all her fur was on top of her head. A quick glance revealed she did n't even have a tail anymore, poor thing. `` I'm still me Isabelle, do n't worry. I mean, I guess worry, but I'm not hurt.'' Kat paced back and forth across the small room, touching furniture as she went. Isabelle's mind raced. There had to be some explanation, something to reason this out. There would be time for that later though, first she needed to figure out how to explain to the other villagers what had happened. Would she say Kat had moved away and this was someone new? They'd need a reason, and a new house, not to mention permits... Well the mayor's position was open and Isabelle already did all the work from when Tortimer was mayor. It would n't take much to convince the villagers they were getting a new mayor.

Wolfgang had been the one to tip her off; in this community, neighbors didn't overlook such absences easily. Though Isabelle's heart wavered with a touch of anxiety, she couldn't shake the simple hope that it was nothing more than a cold or a touch of flu. As the house drew nearer, she raised a hand to the door, rapping gently, \"Kat? It's Isabelle. Wolfgang said you hadn\u2019t been out, so I thought to stop by and see if you\u2019re alright.\" Her voice barely faded when the door, with a reluctant groan, nudged open. Sunlight flooded the entryway, contrasting starkly with the dim interior beyond. Isabelle paused, discomforted by the shadowed threshold but compelled by a stronger urge to ensure Kat\u2019s safety. From inside, a voice emerged, rushed yet familiar. \"Hang on, don't be alarmed. I\u2019m fine. Isabelle, please don\u2019t freak out,\" called Kat. Relief washed over Isabelle upon recognizing her friend\u2019s voice, though curiosity compelled her forward. \"It's so dark in here\u2014I can\u2019t see a thing,\" she murmured, fingers fumbling for the light switch. When light finally filled the room, her breath caught. Before her stood Kat, or rather, a version of her that was startlingly transformed. Gone was the elegant brown fur that once covered her; in its place was smooth skin, an unusual pink, with elongated toes and missing tail. What fur remained now formed a peculiar crest atop her head. \"Isabelle, it\u2019s really still me,\" Kat insisted, her tone a mixture of reassurance and bemusement. \"Maybe worry a little, but I'm safe.\" Her hands moved nervously over the familiar objects in the room, as if trying to anchor herself in the midst of chaos. Isabelle's mind spun, tugged in a dozen directions looking for sense. How could she explain this to the villagers, always hungry for tales and gossip? Would inventing a story about Kat moving away in a rush and this peculiar newcomer work to placate them? She\u2019d need something solid, perhaps even involve red tape and paperwork to keep suspicions at bay. With a mayoral position vacant since Tortimer\u2019s day, and this unexpected change in Kat\u2019s appearance, Isabelle considered the options. Given her current responsibilities practically mirrored the mayor\u2019s, perhaps introducing a newly-appointed \u2018residential liaison\u2019 might pass as believable.

The entry read: 'Today the monster roared. It thundered loudly and made our house tremble. He\u2019s waking up. It\u2019s sunny now, and he enjoys the sun. Mommy used to tell stories about him. He slept for ages. But now the sun is out, and he\u2019s stirring. I don\u2019t really get it. The sun rises every day. Maybe he just had a nap his parents were reluctant to disturb. His roar sounded again today, proof of his awakening. I wonder if mommy will let me see him. He seems terrifying, but mommy insisted he wasn\u2019t. Then again, she seemed uneasy, so maybe she wasn\u2019t entirely honest. Once more, I hear the roar.'

And that day\u2026 That would be a day that my town would never forget. I was a junior in college and there was a party going on. When I showed up, people wanted nothing to do with me. And so I made my way into my own little corner, which became populated with a lot of good looking women rather quickly. And I found myself in luck when they all wanted some pina coladas. They needed coconuts. And I was just the man to supply them. I also revealed an ability to everyone that I had kept hidden. With the blink of an eye everyone at the party found themselves wearing a coconut bra. And the DJ found his headphones replaced with coconuts. I could fashion any sort of clothing out of coconuts instantly. And then the final party trick that really got everyone loving me. You see, it wasn \u2019 t really the coconut that killed me. It was gravity. And so I loosened the gravity at the party and we all enjoyed the feeling of weightlessness. Needless to say, the rest of the party started to go well for me until the very end. Some of the frat guys didn \u2019 t like how popular I \u2019 d become with the ladies. And I was a tinny bit drunk myself. One of them threw a punch at me. Blood spurted everywhere as they were crushed by an unbearable amount of gravity. A couple other frat guys came at me. Soon everyone around was drenched in blood.

My one saving grace was having a head tougher than a coconut. So, life continued with everyone else enjoying their fantastic powers while I remained the outcast\u2014perhaps for the best, as I avoided making enemies. However, there came a day when I couldn't stand being on the outside anymore, a day that changed everything for our town. As a junior in college, I attended a party where I was mostly ignored. I found my way to a corner, and to my surprise, it became populated with many attractive women, eager for pina coladas which required coconuts. Lucky for me, I could provide them, and reveal a secret ability: with merely a blink, everyone at the party was suddenly wearing coconut bras, and the DJ found his headphones swapped with coconuts. I could transform any clothing into coconut attire instantly. As the party continued, I pulled off a grand trick that truly interested everyone. It was gravity, not the coconut, that was my nemesis, so I eased the gravity at the party, letting everyone enjoy the sensation of weightlessness. The party turned in my favor until the very end. Some frat guys were jealous of how the women gravitated toward me, and I was only slightly drunk. When one of them punched me, gravity retaliated, crushing him with immense force.

But, as fate would have it, there came a moment when the sting of exclusion pushed me to the edge\u2014a pivotal day that shook our town's mundane normalcy.

Gravity, rather than coconuts, was my true foe, and in a fleeting triumph, I took the reins and lightened the gravity load at the gathering, leaving everyone to revel in a floating euphoria. From being unacknowledged, the party now swirled in my favor, at least until its finale. Some guys from the frat were plainly envious of the magnetic pull I seemed to have over the women, bolstered, perhaps, by a touch of liquid courage.

Also there was no similar-but-different prompt to post it under. ) ____ The gift from Ra gleamed in His holy light, as the great Pharaoh observed the orb which fell from the heavens. After some time, small cracks began to appear upon the face of the orb. Pharaoh was afraid, fearing that his lack of true reaction to the gift had angered Great Ra, but his priests assured him that this was merely the gift following its path. The orb opened, and within was a child. An infant, about the age of the young prince. `` So, it is Ra's will,'' intoned Pharaoh before the assembled crowd, `` that my son shall have a brother. A gift from Ra himself, in the wake of my queen's passing into the arms of Nephthys.'' And so it was that Kal-Ra ( so named for the scrawling in the inside of the orb, naming the child Kal, and for his nature as a gift from Ra ) was raised as second in line to take the throne when the great Pharaoh would pass. His brother, son-by-blood of Pharaoh, who was named Khufu, was of course first in line. So too, as they grew older, was Khufu first in the priestess Chay-ara's heart. For all Kal-Ra's gifts, and for all his efforts to win the heart of the priestess, still she chose Khufu. For this, Kal-Ra grew jealous of his brother. He hid his feelings well, for the Pharaoh's sons were raised as to be stoic, strong, and firm. But feel he did. As the years passed, and Khufu and Chay-ara grew closer outside of Pharaoh's view ( for great though he was, his view did have its limits ), Kal-Ra was approached by the priest Hath-Set. It was Hath-Set's belief, which we may know as we are not a part of this tale, that he would be able to manipulate Kal-Ra to strike down Prince Khufu, then himself strike down Kal-Ra in secret, that he might possess the heart of Chay-ara. Kal-Ra, however, was smarter than Hath-Set, and so he turned the situation back on the priest. In his cunning way, Hath-Set offered Kal-Ra a gift: a small green stone which had been found at the young adopted prince's landing site. The moment Kal-Ra grasped the stone, he began to weaken. Hath-Set had poisoned him! What had this treacherous priest done?", "text_ai_base": "( I\u2019m sharing a slightly modified prompt because a similar idea struck me.

Over time, minor cracks formed on the surface of the orb. Pharaoh felt fear, worried that his lack of proper response to the gift had angered the mighty Ra. Yet, his priests reassured him that the orb was merely fulfilling its purpose. When the orb opened, it revealed a child\u2014a baby, the same age as the young prince. \"It is Ra's will,\" declared Pharaoh to the gathered crowd, \"that my son shall have a brother, a divine gift following my queen's passage into Nephthys' embrace.\" Thus, Kal-Ra was named after the inscriptions inside the orb, with \"Kal\" marking him and his nature as a gift from Ra. He was raised as second in line to succeed the Pharaoh. His brother, by blood, Khufu, naturally held the first position in line. As they matured, Khufu became the favored one in the heart of priestess Chay-ara. Despite Kal-Ra's many talents and efforts to win her affection, Chay-ara chose Khufu. This bred jealousy in Kal-Ra, although he concealed his emotions, having been taught to be stoic and resilient. As time passed and Khufu and Chay-ara grew closer beyond Pharaoh's gaze (great though he was, even Pharaoh had limitations), Kal-Ra was approached by the priest Hath-Set. Unbeknownst to Kal-Ra, Hath-Set intended to manipulate him to eliminate Prince Khufu, then secretly kill Kal-Ra himself to claim Chay-ara\u2019s affection. However, Kal-Ra was shrewder than Hath-Set anticipated, turning the tables on his scheme. Cunningly, Hath-Set attempted to tempt Kal-Ra with a gift: a small green stone discovered at his arrival site. Upon grabbing the stone, Kal-Ra weakened\u2014Hath-Set had poisoned him!

While it aligns nicely here, distinct differences compelled me to mark them out. Okay, here goes: The Pharaoh stood in awe as a dazzling orb, bestowed by Ra, descended from the heavens amidst divine splendor. Time dimmed its brilliance with slight blemishes, a thin line of cracks marring the surface. Anxious that perhaps his gratitude hadn\u2019t reached the mighty deity\u2019s ears, fear began to gnaw at him. However, his trusted priests quelled such worries, assuring him that the orb was fulfilling its celestial destiny. As the sphere unraveled, it presented an unexpected wonder: a newborn, remarkably the same age as the Pharaoh's own young heir. \"This is the will of Ra,\" proclaimed Pharaoh to all, as his voice resonated across the royal assembly. Declaring the child as his son's newfound brother, a divine addendum in the wake of the queen\u2019s recent departure to journey alongside Nephthys. From the inscriptions within the orb, the child was named Kal-Ra\u2014'Kal' in tribute to the gift from the sun god. Raised to stand second in line to the throne, Kal-Ra followed his brother Khufu, the elder by blood, destined for the crown. As childhood waned and maturity took its place, Khufu found favor in the eyes of the priestess Chay-ara. Despite Kal-Ra\u2019s numerous virtues and persistent endeavors to capture her heart, her choice remained firm\u2014in Khufu's favor. These circumstances sowed seeds of envy within Kal-Ra, though taught to mask his agitation under a veil of stoicism. Era after era passed, as Chay-ara and Khufu's bond expanded unbeknownst to the Pharaoh (despite his boundless wisdom, even a Pharaoh could not see all). Fate introduced Kal-Ra to Hath-Set, a priest with intentions far from noble. Unknown to Kal-Ra, Hath-Set schemed, entangled in plots to first vanquish the rightful heir, Prince Khufu, before turning treachery towards Kal-Ra himself, driven by desires over Chay-ara. Yet Kal-Ra\u2019s cunning exceeded Hath-Set\u2019s expectations, thwarting his malicious designs. Twisting motives into shadowed traps, Hath-Set sought to beguile Kal-Ra with a curious token: a glimmering stone, unearthed at the very site of his celestial ascension.

But, ever since the `` Great Swarm,'' no civilization has been safe. JurTillquinn is one of the Constabilis, an ancient, formerly sleeping race of guardians, nestled in the caverns of the cliffs in the north. It is cold here, where the usual beings can not live. But, in the hundreds of years since the Constabilis slept, the world changed around them. The Terrains, smaller, weaker, and less adaptable than the Constabilis, grew into power. Eventually, truth became myth, and the Terrains grew mighty with knowledge. They dug deep into the world, seeking the oceans, looking for more worlds to conquer. Technology became their focus. No longer did the Terrains have the ability to think independently - they all had built-in devices pressed along their spinal cord. But, they dug too deep, and they woke another race. The Reeks as they were called by the Constabilis infested and killed all who stood in their way. They did not care for technology, knowledge, or love. They crawled and sucked the life out of everything they could. Yet, there was one place their collective mind knew it needed to conquer once and for all: the Northern Cliffs. Yet, one Terrain, given a message by the last leaders huddled in an island near the Northern Cliffs, was given a message to awaken the Constabilis. That Terrain was Niles. Eventually, he would be the last of the race. After finding the Hall of HultenZor, he implanted a device into the doorway, which had awoken the General of the Constabilis. No one, not even his own kind, knew his name. He was massive, dark-skinned, and unique. All of the Constabilis had great size and darker skin tones, but he had something none of them had: the ability to speak. The Constabilis long gave up their ability to speak when they made a sacrifice many eons ago to give up their ability to speak if they could save the Terrain race from utter annihilation by their rivals. They lived without fear ever since. JurTillquinn understood, along with the others, what his General was saying. They abided to their oath to never speak. They knew the gravity of the situation.

JurTillquinn belongs to the Constabilis, an ancient race of guardians that once slept deep within the cold caverns of the northern cliffs, a place inhospitable to ordinary beings.

As myth replaced truth, the Terrain became formidable through knowledge, digging deep into the world in pursuit of oceans and realms to conquer. Technology became their focus, erasing their ability to think independently with built-in devices along their spine. But they delved too deeply and awoke another race: the Reeks. Dubbed 'Reeks' by the Constabilis, these creatures invaded and annihilated all in their path, indifferent to technology, knowledge, or love. They drained life from everything. Their collective will pointed them toward conquering the Northern Cliffs. Yet, one Terrain, named Niles, received a message from the last leaders gathered on an island near the cliffs to awaken the Constabilis. Niles became the final member of his species.

JurTillquinn hailed from the Constabilis, ancient guardians who once slumbered beneath the frosty caverns of the northern cliffs\u2014a place no ordinary life could endure. Over the centuries, while they dreamed away, the world around them advanced. Lesser beings, the Terrain, rose to prominence; despite their smaller stature and fragile bodies, they carved a niche of power through relentless pursuit of knowledge, digging into the earth for realms to rule and oceans to claim. Technology became their beacon, but at a steep cost: implants along their spines chipped away at their autonomy. In their quest for dominion, the Terrain awakened the Reeks. Named 'Reeks' by the Constabilis for their stench and savagery, these creatures left nothing but ruin in their wake, caring little for the civilization\u2019s advances or emotions. The Reeks had a singular objective\u2014conquering the Northern Cliffs. Amidst this chaos, one Terrain named Niles stumbled upon a vital clue.

As I moved closer, I noticed a small, dust-covered object that stood out from the rest. It wasn't made of copper, bronze, iron, or steel. Instead, it was a piece of leather tied to a rope of the same material, accompanied by five small stones. I brushed the dust off the nameplate on the pedestal and saw the Hebrew word **\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3**.

The object kept calling to me, and suddenly I lost control of my body. My hand reached for the weapon, and instantly, I was thrust into a vivid vision. Before me stood a giant, around 9 feet tall, clad in armor and wielding a javelin. Although I'd never seen him before, his name echoed in my mind: *Goliath*. My hand swung the weapon, releasing a stone that struck the giant squarely on the forehead, and Goliath collapsed lifeless to the ground. When I regained my senses, I was trembling and drenched in sweat. Outside, I heard sirens and people shouting. I grabbed the sling and stones and dashed outside. At the gates stood an enormous man, towering about two stories high. I recognized him immediately. \"DAVID! WHERE ARE YOU? WE HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS!\" I stepped forward but felt a hand on my shoulder. \"Mr. President, what are you thinking? You'll get killed!\" \"Samuel, my good friend, I appreciate your concern, but I know what I must do.\" I continued advancing across the White House lawn toward Goliath. \"Today, the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I'll strike you down.

However, my attention was irresistibly drawn to a peculiar object resting quietly in the room's farthest corner. Approaching with curiosity, I found it wasn't forged from copper, bronze, iron, or even steel. Instead, here lay a simple strip of leather, knotted around a similar rope, accompanied by five modest stones. Moving the dust away from the nameplate, engraved with the Hebrew word **\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3**, I felt my rudimentary knowledge stir. \"Beloved,\" I recalled, though clarity soon emerged as I deciphered **\u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5\u05b4\u05d3**\u2014*David*. Fascinated, I found myself helplessly pulled toward the object, my hand extending involuntarily. A rush, a whirl of sensation overtook me, and suddenly, I found myself face to face with a vision of imposing might. A giant, nearly 9 feet tall, armored and gripping a javelin, stood before me. His name resounded within: *Goliath*. My hand, wielding the sling, released a stone, striking its mark upon the giant's forehead. Down he went, from life to lifelessness. As reality returned, sweat drenched me, limbs quivering. Chaos outside pierced the silence\u2014sirens blared, voices shouted. Clutching the sling and stones, I bolted toward the noise.

Now that I'm thinking about it, my guide was quite a strange looking creature. A large barracuda that wiggled as it's long sexy legs carried it forward, as if he did n't know he was n't swimming. Yeah, the legs were pretty sexy. Finally, we came to a clearing. I looked up and saw the sky for the first time in what seemed like forever, a deep blue with cotton white clouds. The clearing itself was a big circle, completely empty and with a dirt ground. The dense jungle surrounded the clearing on all sides. My guide turned to me, `` Wait here until the watcher's arrive.''

I went to the middle of the clearing and popped a squat, wondering how long it would take for the'lookers' or whatever to arrive. My question was instantly answered. A brown hand burst through the ground and motioned for me to come over. I walked over, as i got closer i realized that the hand itself was made out of dirt. When I got sufficiently close, the hand put it's palm up as if it wanted to hold hands. Why not? I grabbed it. Nothing happened. It leg go and gave me a thumbs down symbol, before putting it's palm out again. I grabbed it and pulled, pulling some sort of dirt creature out of the ground; it was coughing and spitting up dirt. When it was done gagging on soil it turned to me with a displeased face, `` You're not the brightest are you? Do n't answer that.''

Those legs were surprisingly elegant. At last, we reached a clearing where, for the first time in ages, I could see the sky: a deep blue dotted with fluffy white clouds.

Strange. I sat in the middle of the clearing, pondering when these \"lookers\" would appear. My curiosity was quickly satisfied when a brown hand emerged from the ground, gesturing for me to approach. As I drew nearer, I realized the hand was made of dirt. It extended its palm as if inviting me to hold it. Why not? I took hold of it. Nothing happened. It released me, gave a thumbs-down, then extended its palm again.

Once it finished, it eyed me with disdain. \"Not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?

Generation after generation, ships carrying descendants of their original crews would be caught up to by ships launched after those descendants' birth; every few years propulsion had made such huge leaps that we were finding the capacity to catch up to, and pick up our fore-bearers, loading them, their data records and their cargo into upgraded next-gen seed ships. -- Their abandoned state-of-the science derelicts would have their trajectory set to return them to an earth orbit, so that the homeworld could scrap them for parts and get the data recorded by these ships' travels... eventually... But in all the time that has since passed that was as close as the seeders-of-far ever came to looking back. They had such vast voids to traverse, even with the upgrades of the last far-launchers, there's no telling which direction those who'd have long ago arrived at their primary destinations may have headed after. -- After all, the farther they got the farther they'd be able to see, especially with the greatest minds of each generation manning each seeder, there's no telling the kinds of sensor upgrades they've made by now. They must be able to see us. As I understand it though depending how fast they've gotten, if they were to look back at our solar system odds are they would only see the ghosts of our past. At least that's the sort of science that explained away why we'd never maintain contact with our far-launchers. Some Pure-Earth conspiracy theorists would occasionally put forth the claim that the launches were a huge hoax, that the crews were people selected for population control. One could hardly blame people for being sensationalists. Here we had supposedly mastered space technology & kept devoting generation after generation to pouring our most advanced tech & people & resources into seed-ship production, yet the global infrastructure was simply falling apart. Populations were booming out of control & resources were stretched thinner than ever. Humanity was choking mother earth & she seemed about ready to choke back.

We had long feared depleting Earth's resources, and perhaps we had already triggered the planet's destruction. Consequently, we launched several seed ships equipped and manned with our brightest minds. These ships carried vast repositories of knowledge, gene banks, and self-replicating nano-builder units, capable of reconstructing technological marvels or developing new Earth-like ecosystems. Most set course for destinations light-years away from our solar system. Over generations, newer ships, launched with better propulsion, would catch up to those launched earlier, absorbing their crews, data, and cargo, and transferring them to upgraded vessels. The abandoned state-of-the-art derelicts were then sent back to Earth orbit to be salvaged for parts and data. However, the seed program rarely looked back. Vast distances lay ahead, and despite the latest advancements, it was unclear where those who arrived at their primary destinations might head next. The farther they traveled, the more they could see, benefiting from improved sensors innovated by each generation's best minds. They might still observe us, but as I understand, depending on their speed, they might only glimpse the ghosts of our past. That explained why we couldn't maintain contact with the far-launchers. Conspiracy theorists occasionally claimed the launches were a hoax or population control efforts. Despite supposedly mastering space technology and dedicating generations to producing advanced seed ships, our global infrastructure was collapsing.

To recreate technological wonders and forge new, habitable worlds. Most ventured to realms light-years beyond the familiar twinkle of our solar system. It's fascinating to think that over several generations, more advanced ships\u2014armed with cutting-edge propulsion\u2014traveled swiftly enough to overtake their predecessors. What\u2019s more, these newer vessels amalgamated crews, data, and cargo, then ferried them aboard their upgraded vessels. The older, now redundant, ships were redirected to Earth's orbit, a repository for precious parts and invaluable data. Yet, those behind the seed program seldom cast longing looks over their shoulders. The cosmic road stretched far ahead, and despite the breakthroughs, uncertainties loomed large over the fate of those arriving at primary destinations. Each new wave of settlers peered deeper into the universe, aided by ever-evolving sensors crafted by our era's brilliant minds. It's conceivable they still watch over us, but if I\u2019m getting this right, their speed might only allow them to glimpse echoes of our history. This might explain our tenuous grip on communication with these distant voyagers. Occasionally, conspiracy theorists suggest the launches were mere sham or a hidden agenda for population control. Yet, despite claiming we've conquered space and committing generations to birthing advanced seed ships, our terrestrial infrastructure crumbles around us.

Her infidelity bore additional consequence; she conceived a child with the stranger. \"This is my second test,\" I said to her when the truth unfolded, accepting yet another apology with an almost serene resignation.

Perhaps that was true, but if so it was before there were books or cities or places to record such events. The great Elven Kingdoms had lasted a thousand generations and none knew of men as anything more than raiders and thieves and so it had always been. In the time after the Third Great War there was much change across the land. The citadels of the Orkfolk were changing, forced to adapt by the peace treaties and the conditions they had places on both the Orkfolk and their Gods. No longer could the great Ork Father Kraa sit in High Murgon and dictate to the Orkfolk how he wished them to war and die, now he was shackled in the Silver Tower, held captive by the united Elven and Dwarf pantheons. He was a guarantee against the behaviour of his people and without his warlike influence they were to last taking to the world. With this change in power came other alterations in the structures of the world though, changes that none could have predicted. With the loosening of Kraa \u2019 s grip, the Ork watchers, who had long guarded against human invasion and indeed had revelled in their guard, were at last relaxed. The Patrols lessened, the towers were abandoned and in a few short years, even the great walls had begun to crumble. But the humans did not come. In the North Wastes, in the place beyond the cold, where humankind had been forced to scratch an existence, a fire was finally burning which could not be extinguished by snow or water. The fire was instead growing more powerful by the day. In the lands to the South the summer brought prosperity and without the threat of war from Orkkind, the elven and Dwarf lands opened themselves to trade and peace. Swords were lost and forgotten and tales of the old wars were told to scare children, but none expected to see them again in their time. They spoke of the second war, where the Elven Kingdoms had first grown, near thousand years ago and thrown back the Ork and Dwarf Kingdoms. They sang of the third war, where the Orks had waged a battle that left scars across the land, as they sought to reclaim what they saw as their lands; but none sun of the first war.

If true, this happened long before books, cities, or records. The mighty Elven Kingdoms had endured for a thousand generations, viewing humans merely as raiders and thieves, a constant through time. Following the Third Great War, the land experienced significant change. The Orkfolk citadels evolved under the new peace treaties, which imposed restraints on both the Orkfolk and their deities. The once-powerful Ork Father Kraa could no longer command from High Murgon; he was imprisoned in the Silver Tower by the combined Elven and Dwarf pantheons. This captivity served as a check on his people's conduct. Deprived of his belligerent influence, the Orkfolk began integrating into the world. Such shifts in power led to unforeseen changes in the world's fabric. As Kraa's hold weakened, the Ork watchers\u2014who had zealously guarded against human incursions\u2014finally relaxed. Patrols dwindled, towers were deserted, and within a few years, even the mighty walls started to crumble. Yet, humans didn\u2019t advance.

To the South, summer brought prosperity, and without the Orks' war threat, the Elven and Dwarf lands welcomed trade and peace.

The Elven Kingdoms, steadfast across a thousand generations, dismissed humans as mere brigands\u2014forever conduits of trouble. Change swept the lands in the aftermath of the Third Great War. The citadels of the Orkfolk, once symbols of prowess, now adjusted under new peace treaties that bound not only the Orkfolk but their very gods. The formidable Ork Father, Kraa, found himself locked away in the Silver Tower, a prison devised by Elven and Dwarf gods working in unison. Without his war-mongering influence from High Murgon, the Orkfolk began weaving themselves into the broader tapestry of the world. This realignment sparked shifts that few had anticipated. As Kraa's sway waned, the vigilant Ork watchers, who once fiercely defended against human approaches, eased their grip. Military patrols grew infrequent, once-manned towers stood abandoned, and within mere years, the grand walls they built started to crumble. Yet humans did not advance. Far to the north, beyond icy expanses where human life clung by a thread, a new, undying flame emerged\u2014impervious to both snow and water, growing ever stronger each day. In contrast, the southern realms basked in summer's bounty. With the Ork threat dissipated, Elven and Dwarf territories flourished, opening their arms to trade and a newfound peace.

Curiously, Mikel sprang an unexpected meeting on us, leaving its purpose shrouded in mystery. Just walking into the bustling office, teeming with police, sent a shiver down my spine. I forced composure, masking my unease with an emotionless face and barely blinking. Our client? A notorious figure known for prowling the streets under moonlight. Trying not to smile\u2014odd, isn\u2019t it?\u2014I pretended to breathe a sigh of relief. What\u2019s their game here? Having me defend a fabricated suspect. A clever ploy, but why not just trap the murderer, waiting for my slip to self-incrimination? Fleeing seemed folly; I\u2019d be captured in an instant. Framing him was equally reckless, drawing a storm of scrutiny. Talk about irony, my moves possibly cementing a case future criminology buffs might dissect. Meeting our enigmatic client face-to-face did nothing to steady my resolve.

It was too early to deal with this\u2014probably just a glitch or something. The moans and thunks continued as I neared the door. Wow, she must really be into it. I almost decided to ignore it, but I had to be at work in three hours and needed my sleep. Tyler's enthusiastic escapades could wait. I knocked on the door a few times, and the noises abruptly stopped. Mission accomplished. I was halfway back to my room when Tyler's door opened. \"Dude,\" I began, turning around, \"it's fine, just quie\u2014\" It wasn\u2019t Tyler. It was his girlfriend. Her skin was a pale green, her clothes stained with blood, and her eyes spun around in sunken sockets. Oh, and she was holding Tyler's disembodied, bleeding head. I froze as her eyes locked onto me. This was it. I was going to die. Paralyzed, I watched as Tyler's girlfriend\u2014or what she had become\u2014sprinted toward me, arms outstretched and mouth open in a toothy grin. Tyler's head hit the wall\u2014\\*thump\\*. For some reason, that sound triggered my fight-or-flight response. Screaming, I ran to the front door and flung it open, pursued by the terrifying creature Tyler's girlfriend had become. As I reached outside, the ground began to shake\u2014an earthquake? Now, of all times? I tripped on the stairs and fell, but surprisingly, the monster didn\u2019t seize the chance to attack. I turned to see it struggling against a massive tentacle reaching out from a floating portal. What on earth was happening? Not questioning my luck, I got up and sprinted down the road. Surely, someone could help me. My neighbors?", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "*Thud.* *Thud.* *Thud.* *Groan.* Odd noises echoed from Tyler\u2019s room, just opposite to mine. With a grunt, I wiped the remnants of sleep from my eyes and dragged myself out of bed. Tyler, it seemed, wasn\u2019t spending the night alone. Again. If I had his looks, perhaps I\u2019d invite someone over too, but did he really have to make such a racket? Squinting at the digital clock while I shuffled toward his door, I wondered why it read 6:66. Since when does time get that confused? Maybe it\u2019s just a glitch, but still\u2014far too early for this nonsense. Approaching the door, the thumping and moaning grew louder. Whoever was with Tyler must have been really enthusiastic. I was tempted to leave them be, but with work looming in three hours, I desperately needed to reclaim my sleep. A few raps on the door later, the noise faded. Success, I thought, heading back to bed. Then, Tyler\u2019s door swung open. \"Dude,\" I started, turning around, \"it's cool, just quie\u2014\" Not quite Tyler. His girlfriend stood there, her skin a ghastly shade of green, with clothes soaked in crimson, and eyes swirling unnaturally in sunken sockets. Oh, and by the way, she had Tyler's severed, bleeding head clutched in her grip. I froze when her gaze fixed on me, realizing I might not make it out alive. Paralyzed, I watched as Tyler\u2019s girlfriend\u2014or whatever she now was\u2014charged at me, arms reaching and mouth widening into a grin filled with teeth. Tyler\u2019s head smacked against the wall\u2014*thud*\u2014and oddly, that sparked my survival instinct. Yelling like a madman, I bolted for the front door, the horrifying creature that was Tyler\u2019s girlfriend hot on my heels. As I darted outside, the ground trembled violently\u2014was this really the time for an earthquake? I stumbled down the stairs, hitting the ground. Yet, curiously, the beast didn\u2019t take the chance to pounce. I turned to see it tangled with a massive tentacle stretching out from a floating portal. What was this madness? But luck\u2014or sheer chaos\u2014was on my side, and without questioning it, I dashed down the street, desperate for help.

Thankfully, our shared apartment had its rhythms, with George mostly flitting about elsewhere, allowing our mismatched lives to coexist without too much friction.

I had wanted kids my whole life, until just a second ago 17 year old me was the happiest she had ever been, as she had just found out she was 4 weeks pregnant. I, however, knew how foolish she had been to be excited. She had no clue that her stupidity was about to lead her down a long road of poverty and sadness. That road, which I have already walked. I was so sick of it, so I wished I could go back in time and make it so it had never happened. Now, here I was.

He was sweating heavily down his back and around his neck, but the rain provided welcome relief - now he was uncomfortable all over. Hurst Hill Hall stood ominous ahead. In the lower classes such a structure would have an effect ranging from slight unease to nervousness, but Sir Richard doubled over in dread. He could not bear to open his eyes. Hands pulled at his arms, breaking them away from his chest, and hoisting him into a functional posture. From their strength and quiet breath Sir Richard knew them as the guards. `` Thank you.'' He squeaked. He felt a headache coming on from lack of oxygen. `` You're okay my Lord, just a tad further and we'll be at the door.'' One of them cooed. Although they were required to do so under their employment contract, Sir Richard liked to think they at least looked at him with pity, if not a swelling compassion, and that their assurances were genuine. Such emotions were luxuries the rich had no time to enjoy. A few steps further and the guard spoke again. `` We're going to knock on the front door now, my Lord.''

They were so close that he inhaled her perfume. Hibiscus, he guessed. `` Is he ready?'' The other guard questioned. He could hear the dull and uncaring tone in her voice. `` Ready.'' The stern guard grabbed the large brass knocker and rammed it once against the door. A staggered noise of terror escaped Sir Richard. The scented guard held tight as he pulled her down into a squat. He could hear his heart pump like one of those antiquated steamboats paddling at full power. He could here hers too, imploring him to set his beat by her own. He heard the ripping of velcro, and sure enough a brown paper bag crinkled against his mouth. `` Breath, my Lord.'' `` Oh, for heaven's sak-'' The main door creaked open. `` Ah, Sir R-rich... ard!

Until a few weeks ago, he had never even left the poor agricultural community where he had been born. At this very moment, he wanted nothing more than to go home. Yet, here he stood, seemingly at the climax of a series of inexplicable coincidences. These coincidences had, over the last few weeks, flung him from the role of poor farmer boy to a princess's only hope. Though rare, this sort of thing was not unheard of. Dexton had heard the stories: every once in a while, an unassuming figure was somehow lifted from his basal existence and thrown into situations of great peril and even greater reward. Many succumbed to the peril, but a few managed to reap the rewards. These occurrences were said to be the work of an omnipotent God who manipulated the mortal world for nothing more than his own amusement. Dexton prayed to this God now. *Please let me go home. I do n't want no treasures or princesses, I just want to go back to my farm and attend to my cabbages'' * Dexton waited, hoping for some sign that his prayers had been heard. None came. He briefly considered turning and running home anyways, but he remembered from the stories that things did not usually turn out well for those who refused the God's calls to action. Cowardice was obviously not a trait that the God favored in his chosen ones. With seemingly no other option, Dexton reluctantly walked into the dragon's cave. *Well then, God, please let me survive this. I'll be more entertaining to you alive than dead. I swear it. Please, God, give me a sign that you mean for me to live. `` * Once more, Dexton waited for a sign. Several minutes passed, and when none came Dexton continued to descend into the dark. Suddenly, he heard a roar. Even though he could n't see far into the inky blackness, knew it was the dragon. Shivers ran down his spine, and a knot formed in his stomach. From somewhere else in the cavern, he heard a woman's voice. The princess, he presumed. As his eyes adjusted to the dim light, he saw her. She had glossy dark hair and piercing blue eyes, and despite the fact that she had been chained to a rock for several weeks, her beauty had been supernaturally preserved.

Many perished facing peril, but a few claimed great rewards. Legend had it that an omnipotent God manipulated mortal fates for sheer amusement. Silently, Dexton beseeched this God, \u201cPlease, let me go home.

Enjoying the simple things in life was something that I \u2019 d learned long ago, and persistence was one of the simple things that people had forgotten. There was a satisfaction from eating healthy and cleansing your body of toxicants the natural way; doing exercise to build resilience; getting wisdom from becoming that bit more frail and weary, rather than just relying on the ReStart\u2122. It was something that took me at least seventy years to figure out. Finally though I was released from my contractual obligations to repay CloneGen.

No more forcible ReStart\u2122 for me for being in debt, thank you very much. It was just as good that my time was over. The world around me was getting more and more disgusting by the minute and I didn \u2019 t have the life left in me to try and keep up anymore. It seemed as if people put all their effort into looking exactly perfect, being as fit and healthy as possible for when they turned twenty-five, but all of that determination and drive went out the window when they got the ReClone\u2122. I mean you \u2019 d be stupid to not make yourself the best you could be once you went for your ReBase\u2122. Every time you got a ReStart\u2122 you wanted to have the best advantage possible. But it was critical to hold onto at least some of that determination and drive to still become a better person. Your ReBase\u2122 wasn \u2019 t the best person that you could be. But everyone had seemed to forget that. Sometimes I thought that I was one of the few sane people left in the modern world. Perhaps one of the only ones left since the early days of ReClone\u2122. It had taken me seventy years to get from twenty-five years old to fifty years old. Well forty nine years and three hundred and sixty days bio age to be exact. I think.

From long ago, I learned to cherish the simple things in life, like persistence, which many seem to have forgotten. Eating healthily and naturally cleansing your body has its rewards, as does exercising to build resilience. These choices bring wisdom, drawn from becoming frail and weary rather than relying solely on ReStart\u2122. It took me nearly seventy years to understand this. Finally, I was free from my contractual obligations to repay CloneGen. I had finally settled the twenty-million-dollar debt I'd incurred from all my ReStarts\u2122. They now allowed me to age beyond a biological age of fifty on my own. No more forced ReStart\u2122 due to debt, thank goodness. It was just as well that my time was waning. The world was becoming more distasteful, and I lacked the energy to keep up. People seemed fixated on achieving physical perfection by the age of twenty-five, but that ambition vanished after their ReClone\u2122. Of course, you'd want to optimize yourself before a ReBase\u2122, but it was vital to retain some drive to truly improve.

Perhaps one of the last remnants from the early days of ReClone\u2122. It had taken me seventy years to progress from twenty-five to fifty.

That's the pesky shadow of aging; our bodies don't quite cooperate, and moving suddenly demands more effort. It was wisdom gathered over time, learning that life's little joys deserve appreciation, especially persistence. In today's fast-paced world, folks often overlook that. Choosing a wholesome diet and giving your body a natural cleanse can indeed pay off, much like exercising to bolster resilience. These are lessons hard-earned, particularly when frailty teaches more than all the synthetic rejuvenation of ReStart\u2122. It took me almost seventy years to come to grips with this understanding. At last, the weight of my debt to CloneGen had been lifted\u2014a staggering twenty million dollars from endless ReStarts\u2122, now settled. Finally, I was free to age, true to my biology, beyond fifty years on my own terms. No more obligatory ReStart\u2122 due to debt, thank goodness.

It seemed everyone was obsessed with pinpointing physical perfection by twenty-five, only for that drive to evaporate after a ReClone\u2122 procedure.

Truth be told, labeling it a forest felt overly kind; it was anything but an inviting haven for nature lovers.

Now I hurry through the motions; phone\u2014check; wallet and trusty ticket\u2014check. It's a ritual as familiar as brushing teeth, offering solace before the storm hits. Three, two, one... each tick on the clock feels eternal. Triumph looms nearby, promising release from the restraint of waiting. Perhaps this echoes the feelings of those genuinely invested in a lottery win. Maybe their generosity stems from supporting this shared illusion. \"And tonight's winning numbers are... 14, 29, 2, 11, 19, 31, and 17!\" announces the voice from the TV. Without glancing, I recognize victory. Frozen to my chair, I savor these precious seconds. They're mine to treasure. I'm left pondering how long it'll take for discovery this round. Fingers crossed it drags on... Knock, knock\u2014a sharp rap on the door jerks me back to reality.

I knew that I'd have to be... creative shall we say, to achieve a balance between personal morals and illegal activities. But the idea, to commit every crime without capture, that intrigued me. I wish I could say it had been my idea, and if I had n't already crossed off copyright theft from my list I'd take the credit, but no it came from my brothers girlfriend Kelly. It was one of those relaxed, slightly drunken, conversations you find yourself having at the end of a party. There were a few of us talking and laughing and eating the last of the birthday cake when someone started telling a story about how he'd once went home early only to find his now ex-roommate stealing his stuff to pay off his hooker. Only the guy was so high he did n't even notice he was trying to hand over his stolen loot to its original owner. When challenged on it he'd thrust a handful of badly photocopied bank notes at him and screamed `` I'm a bro, I can fix this'' and then puked over himself before collapsing unconscious. We were all laughing with disbelief and shock as he ended the story with how he had to then explain all of that to the police and ambulance crew while constantly reassuring them it was all true. And as we finished laughing and started getting ready to leave, Kelly idly wondered out loud who in history had ever broken the most laws. That was it. A lighthearted question no one could answer became my obsession. I started with research. Academic papers, history books, archives, libraries, I scoured each bit of information for clues. But I could never get an answer that seemed right. I found countless criminals throughout history but they were always known for committing a handful of crimes. A man who had killed eight people became infamous but the fact was he had only broken one law, that of murder, eight times. The man who had broken eight different laws without killing anyone had largely gone unrecorded, at least as far as I could find. I finally decided that to achieve peace of mind I would need to make my own answer, and it would have to be me. I would make it my life's mission to break every law at least once. Now I know what you're thinking. Why? I'm sorry to say I have no idea. Maybe a therapest could answer it. Perhaps I have a naturally twisted mind. Or it was just the right, or rather wrong, idea at the right time. Or there's no reason behind it and I just... do it.", "text_ai_base": "I'm not evil. I understood early on that I'd need to be\u2014let's say, creative\u2014to strike a balance between my personal morals and engaging in illegal activities. The challenge of committing every crime without getting caught fascinated me. I wish I could claim it as my idea, but since I've already crossed copyright theft off my list, I can't take credit. It was actually Kelly, my brother\u2019s girlfriend, who sparked it. During one of those relaxed, slightly tipsy conversations at the end of a party, the question arose. A few of us were enjoying the last of the birthday cake, exchanging stories and laughter. One of the guys recounted how he once returned home early to find his now ex-roommate, strung out, trying to pawn stolen goods back to their original owner to settle debts with a hooker. He was so high he didn\u2019t notice the irony. When confronted, he'd thrust a handful of poorly photocopied banknotes at him, shouting, \"I\u2019m a bro, I can fix this,\" only to promptly puke on himself and pass out. We all laughed in disbelief and shock; the story concluded with him having to explain the entire saga to the police and ambulance crew, assuring them it was all true. As the laughter faded and people began to leave, Kelly wondered aloud who in history had broken the most laws. That question, though lighthearted, ignited my obsession. I dove into research\u2014academic papers, history books, archives, libraries\u2014searching for clues. Still, I never found a satisfying answer. Many historical criminals committed numerous crimes, but often just a handful repeatedly. A murderer infamous for killing eight people had only broken one law, eight times. Meanwhile, someone who had violated eight different laws without killing anyone often went unrecognized, or at least I couldn\u2019t find them in the records. Eventually, I realized that to find peace of mind, I needed to create the answer myself, and it would have to be me. I decided my life's mission would be to break every law at least once. You might be wondering why. Honestly, I can\u2019t say. Maybe a therapist could offer an explanation. Perhaps I have a naturally twisted mind, or it was just the wrong idea at the right time.

I'd love to claim it was my brainchild, but I'd already scratched copyright theft off my list, so no stealing credit here. Nope, the spark was lit by Kelly\u2014my brother's girlfriend\u2014after one of those laid-back, slightly inebriated chats at the tail end of a party. A handful of us lingered, tackling the last crumbs of birthday cake while swapping anecdotes and chuckles. One guy recounted a bizarre incident: he came home prematurely to find his ex-roommate, high as a kite, attempting to sell back stolen goods to their rightful owner, all in a bid to pay off a hooker. Oblivious to the irony, his roommate thrust a fistful of badly photocopied banknotes at him, proclaiming, \"I\u2019m a bro, I can fix this,\" right before vomiting all over himself and passing out cold. The rest of us could only laugh in stunned amusement. The night ended with him painstakingly explaining the entire tale to the police and paramedics, swearing it was true. As the laughter fizzled and people began drifting toward the door, Kelly broke the remaining silence with a curious question: who, throughout history, had shattered the most laws? Though asked lightly, that query stuck with me. Soon enough, I found myself neck-deep in research\u2014poring over academic papers, dusty history books, and ancient archives. Yet, no satisfying answers surfaced. Sure, there were notorious criminals, but more often than not, they repeatedly violated just a few laws. A serial killer infamous for eight victims technically only breached one law multiple times. Conversely, those who skirted eight separate laws without leaving a corpse behind seemed lost to history, or at least buried in records I couldn't access. After all that searching, it dawned on me that if I wanted closure, I needed to make my own mark. I set my sights on a new life mission: to violate every law at least once. Now, you might ask why. Truthfully, I'm not sure. Perhaps a therapist could untangle that mystery for me, if I ever got around to asking one.

I've been stuck in hours upon hours upon hours worth of meetings with high-powered local figureheads, gruff contractors, and hordes of perfectionist engineers. Anyway, as you can imagine, it's been tough. So really, spending a few really uncomfortable hours in the car is a piece of cake if it means getting away from the human pressure cooker for a weekend. I'm holding about 80 in the left lane of the two lane desert highway. Not exactly kosher, if you're the kind of guy who follows the letter of the law, but out here on this kind of road, everybody does it.

The monotonous repetition of this long car journey seems to weigh heavily on my mind, and the very essence of my consciousness feels relentlessly battered. Since lunch, the July desert sun has been streaming through the car windows on my side, causing sweat to settle comfortably between my back and the seat. Even with the air conditioning on full blast, the heat and humidity have made the car's atmosphere so dense it feels almost swimable.

I'm pretty drowsy myself, having stayed up all night packing\u2014that'll do it to anyone. Despite it all, I'm looking forward to the trip nearly as much as Eliza, though perhaps not quite as intensely. Going to Disneyland is undoubtedly a significant milestone for a 7-year-old girl. Recently, my work life has been overwhelming\u2014a whirlwind of intense months due to the chaos surrounding the Bay Bridge retrofit failure, with our firm stepping in to inspect and rectify the situation. Half my time has been spent out in the field, and during the remainder, I've been on call supporting other field workers. Endless meetings with influential local officials, gruff contractors, and meticulous engineers have eaten up my hours. Understandably, it's been challenging. So, spending a few rather uncomfortable hours in the car feels like a small price to pay for a weekend away from this unrelenting pressure. I'm cruising at about 80 in the left lane of this two-lane desert highway. Not exactly by-the-book if you're a stickler for traffic laws, but out here, everyone does it.

I lost count somewhere back when the miles started blurring together. This relentless repetition seems to hammer at my already weary mind. The desert sun, harsh and unyielding, has been pouring its rays through the car window since lunch, casting a sweltering glaze over everything. Sweat trickles down, finding a home where my back meets the seat, indifferent to the full-blast air conditioning that\u2019s struggling in vain against the heat and humidity. It\u2019s like sitting in a soup. My hands waver between numbness and tingles with each mile marker, a not-so-gentle reminder of the vibrations from this neglected stretch of interstate. I\u2019m drowsy too\u2014packing through the night will do that. Sleep might be elusive, but I have to admit, the prospect of Disneyland has lit a small spark of excitement in me, almost as bright as the one in Eliza\u2019s eyes. For a 7-year-old, this trip is monumental. Work has been a nonstop barrage recently, a chaotic muddle due to the urgent retrofit issues of the Bay Bridge.

In a lower voice, he confided `` You'll have to forgive the poor boy, it's his first time doing this, and he obviously is n't comfortable with the material.'' The president nodded, her expression surprisingly forgiving and understanding, perhaps due to the revelation of what Jenkins said rather than how he said it. A woman only barely Jenkins' senior stood next. Her uniform bore the surname'Latrell'. `` I think we can all agree that aliens obviously existed. No real surprise there. But you may not have guessed that aliens are n't the only non-human intelligent life forms we're aware of, Madam.''

The polls showed Senator Stiles ( D-CA ) and Governor Wilson ( R-KY ) were neck and neck. The previous eight years of peace and economic growth could be contributed to the bipartisan effort to actually make the United States a country to be proud of. No longer were the two isles busy flinging shit at each other. In fact, it almost did n't matter who won the presidential election. Each candidate showed willingness to work with the other parties ( yes, more than two parties ) in Congress order to pass legislation. Fred Phelps would turn 95 years old in 8 days. He had delegated the everyday workings of the Westboro Baptist Church to his daughter, though he was still considered the symbolic figurehead. Phelps watched as his country, state by state, voted to make same-sex marriage legal. The only state which had held out was his home-state of Kansas. However, this year, there was a proposition on the ballot to make the United States homogeneous in regards to same-sex marriage. Phelps and the WBC had n't stopped picketing. Either in their hometown, or flying across the country for a soldiers funeral or the opening of a Center for LGBTQ teens. Standing on street corners with signs reading `` God Hates Fags'' and `` Thank God for Dead Soldiers'' was still the go-to protest tactic. As the 21st had worn on, Phelps had started receiving more and more criticism from everyone from Bill O'Reily to Chris Matthews. Criticism soon turned to outright hate. Phelps could n't count how many times he had received death threats. He constantly had to have his property cleaned of eggs and pumpkins and toilet paper.

Phelps watched as state after state legalized same-sex marriage, with Kansas being the holdout. This year, a ballot proposition sought to standardize same-sex marriage laws across the nation. Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church continued their protests, either locally or by traveling nationwide to soldiers' funerals or LGBTQ center openings. Their usual tactic was holding signs with messages like \"God Hates Fags\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers.\" As the 21st century wore on, Phelps faced mounting criticism from figures like Bill O'Reilly and Chris Matthews, which soon turned into outright hate.

His passage from the magazine into the firing chamber went unnoticed, thanks to inertial suppressors that muted any sensation. Only a blinking red alert signaled his advancement. But no technological safeguard could dim the tidal wave of adrenaline as his pod accelerated to a breathtaking 4% of light speed over just six kilometers toward another target. In that deceptively calm yet perilous approach, lasting a tedious 24 hours, he clung to focus. Repetitive simulations had dulled the anticipation, while readings from his pod's external sensors showed his platoon aligned in neat trajectories. Mechanically, he ran one last check\u2014systems green\u2014but his bones ached with fatigue. Suddenly, a shrill alert yanked him from uneasy slumber. Mere minutes to impact, anxiety ignited fiercely in his chest as diagnostics confirmed all systems go.

He would move to avoid my touch, turn away to evade speech, and simply disappear amongst crowds. The aquiline nose, strong jaw, sunken eyes - an odd shade of green - and defined cheeks gave the visage a look of nobility, a king perhaps. But his skin, a shade of brown darkened by years of work in the sun, suggested otherwise. He wore loose fitting, enamel white clothes, like a nomad of some vast desert. He had never smiled, until today. I could only imagine he grew careless, unaware I was watching. I dismissed the thought. Then, an hour later, he seemed to pick something up. A pen.

Zooey takes out her flute and says, \"No, it's worse. Ask the eagle. He'll tell you more.\" The eagle settles on Lodai's back, giving him a vision of horned men in silver clothing riding elephants and rhinos, tearing down the library of wisdom trees and commanding baboons with torches. Zooey summons the bees with her flute, which buzzes as hives sprout from the trees. \"Good plan. You cover the treetops, I'll handle the ground,\" Lodai says, jumping to the forest floor. The sound of elephants uprooting trees echoes as Lodai's steps bring mist from the grassy carpet of the forest. Baboons with torches fall from the trees, focused instead on the stinging bees.

Have a chat with our eagle friend.\" Perched on Lodai's shoulder, the eagle transmits a vivid vision: horned warriors clad in shimmering silver, riding upon elephants and rhinos. These figures lay waste to the library of wisdom trees, commanding baboons armed with torches. Zooey, responding to the threat, plays her flute, summoning an army of bees. Hives sprout from the tree branches as the bees buzz into action. \"Smart plan. You take care of things up here; I'll handle what's down below,\" Lodai declares, springing to the forest floor. As Lodai moves, the echoes of uprooted trees by elephants resonate through the woods. The forest floor becomes dense with mist, masking Lodai's steps. Meanwhile, the baboons with torches become distracted, overwhelmed by the aggressive, stinging bees. Barely acknowledging the chaos around him, Lodai navigates the softening ground, which transforms into a swamp where crocodiles begin to surface.

As his power takes shape, flames singe his arm, exposing the ember-glowing core hidden within his wooden being. Responding swiftly, Zooey leaps from her perch, her flute transforming seamlessly into a rusty axe head, severing Lodai's burning arm. Emerging from the blaze, the hare-lipped man brandishes a silver axe, proclaiming, \"Behold, crafted from the rock I snatched from your river.

Jim seemed a bit more composed. \"It looks like some message from a game or something,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Wait, quiet a sec\u2014I think I hear something,\" Jim added, straining to listen. Suddenly, a low buzzing sound became apparent, swirling around them. A chuckle escaped as Jim pulled a small spray can from his pocket. \"Oh, I get it now.\" Ron, with a mix of curiosity and disbelief, questioned Jim. \"What's going on?\" Jim smirked and held up the bug spray. \"Relax, it's just mosquitoes. I\u2019m dealing with it.\" Ron's eyes widened even further. \"You're telling me the car thinks mosquitoes are enemies?!\" The car door then swung open, revealing its pristine interior. Grinning sheepishly, Jim confessed, \"Bought this quirky auto-defense system from a guy behind Pizza Hut a while back. Guess it's finally doing its job.\" Ron shook his head, chuckling despite his confusion. \"Seriously, Jim. How's this even happening\u2014\" Jim cut him off, half-joking and half-exhausted. \"Just get in, Ron.

Her experiences from the Tiers had shown her that such a relationship with food was a status symbol, a privilege flaunted by the wealthy.

I checked it, got one new message. It was a picture of a woman: redhead, ponytail, pink blouse under a black hoodie, dragging a rolling suitcase behind her into an airport building. I knew where it was; about ten minutes by foot, less by car. I grabbed my rental's keys and headed out the door. It was a nice day outside, perfect for a drive into the city to window shop, but I had a job to do. I got on the plane with no problems, even got my tools past security. I got onto the plane just as easily, citing a family emergency. Sure, I was in coach and the target was in 1st, but a job was n't worth taking if it did n't present at least a little bit of a challenge. That was the least of my problems. When we were in the air, I excused myself to use the restroom and changed into a flight attendant's uniform I'd obtained two days before. My first hurdle appeared in the form of a stewardess. Tall, blonde, eyes that betrayed the exhaustion behind her smile that faded the second she saw me. `` What are you doing in the restroom?'' she asks. `` Sorry, nature called very strongly. I'm still getting used to flying.'' Not entirely a lie. `` That's fine. Now, listen, I want you to handle 1st-class. I'd do it, but I'm afraid I'd wind up throttling the kid who keeps tripping me whenever I pass.'' He'll be the one with the Transformers t-shirt and bright-red sneakers.'' `` Thanks for the warning. Look, go take a break, you look dead on your feet. Grab a coffee or a sandwich or something.'' Again, not entirely a lie. The poor kid's bound to start losing hair next. `` Sure, I think I will.'' She leaves me with a quick smile, a genuine one, judging by the way it reached her eyes. I look at the list of names in my hand. None of them matter, except one. Mischa Elgin, row 4-b. Steak, medium-well, side of white rice and veggies, red wine. Pretty average meal choice. It'd be pretty easy to disguise the poison I'd intended to use. So I went down to the kitchen and got to work. I grabbed the tray with the appropriate name and row on it, then headed back up to 1st-class. That's when I met hurdles 2 and 3.

The day was beautiful, perfect for a leisurely drive into the city, but duty called. Boarding the plane proved easy, and I even managed to get my tools past security by citing a family emergency.

It was barely a ten-minute walk, or less if you're driving. Without wasting a moment, I snatched my rental car keys and slipped out the door. The weather outside was pleasing, the sort that made you want to take a leisurely drive, but as fate would have it, work dragged me in a different direction.

Weird, all doors in grandma's house squeaked. But it meant that I could close it silently, which I did, the small'click' of the door closing the only noise it made. I turned, the stairs to the attic, too, did n't seem to fit the rest of the house.

At the top, though, I found to my surprise, a table. A new looking table. With an old typewriter on it which did n't seem to rightly fit in this new looking room. `` Huh.'' I said. This was odd, considering there was nothing else in the attic, just a new looking table and an old looking type writer. I moved forward. There was one sheet of paper already in the typewriter. Maybe grandma was about to write something? But the paper was blank. Mommy said not to touch things that were n't yours, but since this was grandma's, and since she's family, technically- I typed my name, `` R-i-l-e-y.'' The click-clack of the old typewriter in the new room echoed off the walls. `` My... name... is... R-i-l-e-y.'' I typed slowly. I did n't want to mess up, the words looked pretty on the paper and typing a word wrong would look weird. `` I like kittens and strawberry ice-cream.'' I almost stumbled over the word'strawbe-r-r-y'.

What could be so terrible about a dusty, old attic? \"11... 10... 9... 8...\" With my decision made, I raced up the stairs cautiously, aware that my footsteps would announce my position on the second floor. My heart raced as I reached the attic door, but Ryan\u2019s countdown echoed below, pushing me to open it. Strangely, the door didn\u2019t creak. Every door in Grandma\u2019s house creaked, but this one silently clicked shut behind me. I turned to face a staircase that seemed oddly new, not at all like the creaky kitchen stairs with the tricky step Emma always tripped on. These new stairs were silent as I crept up, leaving Ryan\u2019s counting behind. There were fifteen steps\u2014I counted each one. At the top, to my surprise, was a table. It looked new, but an old typewriter sat on it, oddly contrasting the modern room. \u201cHuh,\u201d I mused. It was strange\u2014just this table and the typewriter in the entire attic. Curiosity piqued, I approached. There was already a sheet in the typewriter, but it was blank. Though Mom said not to touch what wasn\u2019t mine, this was Grandma's, and technically, it was family property. I typed, \"R-i-l-e-y,\" the click-clack resonating in the quiet room. \"My... name... is... R-i-l-e-y,\" I typed slowly, wanting to keep it neat. \"I like kittens and strawberry ice cream,\" I added, nearly tripping over the word \"strawberry.\" A loud thud from below drew my attention, followed by a squeal\u2014Ryan must have found Emma. I turned back to the typewriter and froze at the sight: \"Hello R-i-l-e-y.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "\"15... 14... 13... 12...\" Time was running out. Emma and Tommy had already scattered, securing their hiding places while I floundered\u2014until the attic came to mind. A pang of hesitation hit me. Mom's words always echoed about how the attic remained off-limits. Emma, Tommy, and Ryan obeyed without question, but my curiosity often got the best of me. What was so forbidden about a dusty attic anyway? \"11... 10... 9... 8...\" Resolute, I charged upstairs, mindful of each creaky step threatening to betray my presence on the second floor. The heartbeat in my chest quickened as I approached the attic door. Ryan's countdown reverberated from below, hastening my hand\u2019s turn of the knob. Oddly enough, the door swung shut without a sound. Not a creak\u2014unlike every other squeaky door in Grandma\u2019s abode. This one quietly clicked and sealed, leaving me in silence. Ahead lay a staircase looking brand new\u2014nothing like those ancient kitchen stairs where Emma always stumbled on the tricky step. These, surprisingly silent steps, carried me upwards, leaving Ryan's counting behind. Fifteen steps, each counted dutifully. And there at the top awaited the unexpected: a pristine table with a vintage typewriter perched atop it, standing in stark contrast to the room\u2019s otherwise modern design. \"Well, isn't that peculiar?\" I found myself murmuring at the sight. Just the table. Just the typewriter. Glancing curiously at the typewriter, I noticed paper already set\u2014a blank sheet beckoning silently. Despite Mom's caution against touching what's not ours, this was Grandma's space\u2014family's territory, technically speaking. Temptation took over, pressing me to type: \"R-i-l-e-y.\" The rhythmic clatter filled the calm room, echoing in my ears. \"My... name... is... R-i-l-e-y,\" I painstakingly tapped out, aiming for neatness. \"I like kittens and strawberry ice cream,\" I added, finding \"strawberry\" a bit of a tongue-twister even in type. Suddenly, a loud thud accompanied by a squeal snapped my attention away. Must've been Emma, caught by Ryan. Returning to the typewriter, my breath caught at what met my eyes: \"Hello R-i-l-e-y.\"", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

The class had seen this before, of course. The painting was synonymous with the Communist movement in the 40s and 50s, a period incredibly boring to Mr. Peters' class and teens across the globe for its largely uneventful three decades. Everyone loved learning about the Great War in the beginning of the 20th century, and everyone was fascinated by the Wars of Containment between the US and USSR in the 70s, but the 1930s to 50s were decades of immense nothingness in the view of the average American 16 year old.

The factory workers back there hazing the Orthodox Jew. The banker in the dingy house over there counting money is clearly portrayed as a Jewish stereotype.'' The tour guide briefly looked to the painting and laughed, `` Oh yes, good eye dear. Scholars have noticed those images as well, but it's universally considered a practical joke.

I am proud to be able to say that I have led this land for the last eight years, and I am sure every single President who has previously had the honor of holding the post would say the same. However, my term is now coming to a close, and I must soon leave office. After countless weeks of discussions with my staff, I have decided that this final Presidential Address would be the best time for me to make the announcement that has been planned since my second term started. From the end of my term onward, there will be no more presidents. I know what you're all thinking. Why? Well, that's where the big personal announcement comes in. My countrymen, I must admit that I have not been entirely honest with you from the beginning, the greater part of a decade ago. So here it is out in the open for the first time. I'm a woman. And not just a woman. A transgender woman. And not just a transgender woman. A pansexual transgender woman. And on top of that, I have Hispanic and Asian ancestry. To top it all off, I am an immigrant from a poor background. That's right. An immigrant. Now you might be asking yourself how this relates to the ending of the Presidency? Well, the answer is simple. With all my previous personal features publicly known, there is no need to have any other presidents to address any issues related to equality of the position. We wo n't need a Hillary Clinton to be the first female president. We do n't need a Juan Alvarez to be the first Hispanic president. We do n't even need Happy McGay to be the first openly gay or bi or whatever president. I'm all of the above. So America, I leave you with this.

After thorough discussions with my staff, I've decided that this final Presidential Address is the fitting moment to unveil a planned announcement that has been anticipated since my second term began: after my term ends, there will be no more presidents. You may be wondering, why? This ties into my personal revelation. Fellow citizens, I must confess that I haven't been completely upfront with you since I took office nearly a decade ago. Today, I openly share my truth for the first time: I am a woman\u2014a transgender woman. Moreover, I identify as a pansexual transgender woman. I also have Hispanic and Asian roots and am proud to be an immigrant from a humble background. Yes, an immigrant. You might be asking how this connects to the conclusion of the Presidency. The answer is simple. With my diverse identity publicly known, there's no need for future presidents to address questions of representation in the office. We won't need someone like Hillary Clinton to be the first female president or Juan Alvarez to be the first Hispanic president. Nor will we need Happy McGay to be the first openly LGBTQ+ president.

I know you might be scratching your heads, asking why this drastic change. It intertwines deeply with my personal journey. For nearly a decade, there's been an aspect of my identity that I haven't openly shared with you all until now. It\u2019s time I laid it bare\u2014I am a transgender woman, uniquely identifying as pansexual.

He turned to take one last look before the wrinkled old gatekeeper slowly hobbled to close the doors. Taking in a deep breath, and gathering his courage, he took the first step in his journey to attaining a Guardian Spirit. It was a long standing tradition in his village. No one knew when, or how it started, or even where these spirits came from, but it was passed on to each generation from parent to child. The children of the village on their 18th birthday were sent through the gates, and into the Garden to look for the old shrine. There they would pray to the Gods, and if successful, they would be awarded a Guardian Spirit which would protect its host, and bestow upon them great blessings. And so, as tradition dictated, Mus started his journey. They say the garden takes a different form each person. Even if two people were to enter the garden at the same time, they would be instantly separated before they could notice, and each would see a different world around them. Each person's journey, and challenges would be different. Unfortunately for Mus, it seemed that the Gods did not particularly favor him, and his `` Garden'' turned out to be a steep forboding mountain. Dragging his feet up the path while cutting away at the thick foliage, he slowly made his way towards the top. After what seemed like hours of huffing and puffing, he decided to take a break. He sat down on a nearby rock to grab a quick bite to eat. While looking through his pack he noticed a letter that was stuffed in between some of this things.

The only one which Mus could consider to be his best friend. Accipiter was her name. She was, frankly speaking the complete and total opposite of Mus. Accipiter was loud, boisterous and physically strong, while Mus had always been quiet and meek person. It was quite surprising, especially to Mus himself that the two of them would end up as best friends.

I flip open the lock and wait until the split second I see the timer reset. I click, and for my efforts receive yet another 59. My co-worker walks into the room office shortly afterwards. `` You did n't already press it, did you?'' he says as soon as he sees me. `` Yeah, I wanted to get a 60 but it turns out that's really hard to do.'' He groans and puts his head in his hands. When he looks up I see his bloodshot eyes with purple bags underneath. He looks like he has n't slept in a month. His eyes meet mine, and I see a face full of the deepest spite I've ever seen. `` Filthy purple.'' -- - On the fourth day I walk into the office to find a note on my desk. *DO NOT PRESS THE BUTTON* I see my co-worker sleeping at his desk. He wakes up when he hears me slide my chair out from under my desk. `` You look like crap,'' I say. `` Do n't even talk to me,'' he says. `` You people disgust me.'' `` Whoa, what did I ever do to you?'' I ask. `` Do you know how many years I've spent trying to keep this world going?'' He says, not making any sense. `` The first time around I joined the Knights of the Button. Good group, but it was mostly for fun. I used the Squire to get a red flair.'' `` What's that?'' I say.", "text_ai_base": "\"Hey, take a look at this,\" I tell my coworker as he enters the office. \"Yesterday, they said this button could only be clicked once, but it let me do it again today!\" \"You already clicked it?\" he asks. \"Yeah, I wanted to see if it really would,\" I reply. He looks uneasy and keeps glancing at his phone. \"So you're a filthy purple then,\" he remarks with a grin. \"What does that mean?\" I inquire. \"You don't remember? The 60's master race? The Emerald Council? The Red Guard? The Battle of Blood?\" He looks at me like I should understand these references. \"Uhh... are we still talking about the button?\" I ask. \"Nevermind,\" he says, checking his phone again. \"Let's just focus on work today.\" The button was still there on the third day. The safety lock remained, with a blue button beneath it, just waiting for me to press. I had received a score of 59 twice in a row over the past couple of days. What was it my coworker mentioned? The 60's master race? I flip open the lock and wait for the precise moment the timer resets. I click, but once again, I receive a 59. Shortly after, my coworker enters the office. \"You didn't press it already, did you?\" he asks as soon as he spots me. \"Yeah, I was aiming for a 60, but it turns out it's really hard to get,\" I admit.

His gaze flits nervously to his phone, fingers tapping against its screen in anxiety. \"So you're one of those purple folks, huh?\" he chuckles, though there's an edge to his voice. \"What on earth does that mean?\" I ask, bewildered. He just shakes his head like I've missed something obvious. \"Remember the 60's master race? The Emerald Council? The Red Guard? The Battle of Blood?\" His words dance around me like some unfamiliar tune. \"Uhh... are we still discussing the button?\" I say, confused. \"Forget it,\" he mutters, phone screen glowing again in his hand. \"Let\u2019s just stick to work today.\" Day three rolls in, and there sits the button\u2014still under its safety lock, but taunting me with its vivid blue gleam beneath. Twice in two days, I got stuck on a score of 59. My thoughts drift back to what my coworker mentioned, something about the 60's master race. I inch open the lock and linger just long enough for the timer's rhythmic reset. A click, but relentlessly, it's another 59. Moments later, the door swings open to reveal my coworker. \"You hit the button already, didn't you?\" he interrogates, finding me there. \"I was hoping for a 60\u2014turns out, breaking through is harder than it looks,\" I confess. He groans, burying his face in his hands before he rises with eyes that hardly belong to him; bloodshot and surrounded by grey shadows. His glare pierces through me. \"Filthy purple.\" The fourth morning welcomes me with a firm message papering my desk: *DO NOT PRESS THE BUTTON*. It's impossible not to notice my coworker dozing at his station. The screech of my chair jolts him awake. \"You look beat,\" I comment, unsure what else to say. His response is cold. \"Don't even start with me,\" he snaps, a chasm opening between us. \"Seriously, what did I do?\" I interject, confused by his animosity. \"Do you know how many years I've spent trying to keep this whole operation afloat?\" He rambles, bits and pieces of some past shaped by mystery. \"Back then, I was part of the Knights of the Button. It seemed a solid group but mainly for kicks. Using the Squire got me a red flair.\" \"Squire, red flair\u2014what are those?\" I ask, lost in his world away from mine.", "humanizer_model": "gpt-4o", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false}

I shook my head as my eyes grew accustomed to the light. I was n't sure where exactly I was, or how I got here, but I did remember dying. Or at least, it felt like death. You know, I had my whole family there. I was old, living out my final days in the comfort of my childhood home. My kids were there, and so were their kids, and even a few of my great-grandchildren. I had lived a good life. `` He's reliving his last moments,'' a second voice said. It was feminine, unlike the first. `` That's normal. Open the pod.''

Like it was made up in some lab a thousand miles away, never to be touched by mankind. I finally saw who the two voices belonged to. The second was a female, as I assumed. She stood tall, posture was perfect, and her hair looked just like my daughters. Wanda. That was her name, I *knew* it. The first voice was a man who looked old but had to be thirty years my younger. Or, was he my younger? I looked at my hands, my eyes drifting between the man's long grey beard and my own hands. They were n't wrinkly anymore. No, they were soft and *calloused*. I nodded. `` How was Heaven?'' I almost laughed at God's comment, that was n't his *actual* name, that's just what everyone called him around here. He was the Creator and the Savior, and just about everything in between. `` Better,'' I finally managed to croak out, my voice was coarse. From the pod, the fluids they fed me, I remembered that too. `` I made it to ninety-seven.'' I coughed a bit, thick pockets of dried phlegm coming out of the back of my throat. `` We watched your progress. A perfect run.'' I agreed. `` I can do better. Next time I go in.'' Wanda sighed at the comment and then I remembered. My eyes shut and my hands found their way to my face.

The first voice belonged to an older man, appearing about thirty years younger than me\u2014or was he actually younger? As I glanced between his long gray beard and my own hands, I realized they were no longer wrinkled. Instead, they were soft and calloused. I nodded. \"How was Heaven?\" he asked, a question that made me nearly laugh at the notion of him being God\u2014not his real name, but that's what everyone called him here. He was the Creator and the Savior, and everything in between. \"Better,\" I managed to say, though my voice was rough, probably from the fluids they had been feeding me in the pod. I recalled, \"I made it to ninety-seven.\" After coughing, clearing dried phlegm from my throat, he commented, \"We watched your progress. A perfect run.\" I agreed. \"I can do better next time.\" Wanda sighed at my response, and then it all came back to me.

Though how I ended up in this place was a mystery, what wasn't a mystery was the fact\u2014or at least the sensation\u2014that I'd already met my end. My family had been gathered around me, all of them: my children, their children, even some great-grandkids. Spending my last moments in the house where I grew up seemed a fitting end to a life well-lived. Just then, another voice broke through my recovering consciousness. \"He's reliving those final moments,\" said a woman's voice, distinctly different from the first. \"That's perfectly normal. Open the pod,\" she instructed. A gentle hissing noise followed, and with it, the glass enclosure\u2014my apparent cocoon\u2014was lifted to reveal a room crafted with an unsettling precision, like something out of a scientist's sterile dream. I finally faced the owners of those voices. One was a woman, statuesque and with hair that reminded me of my daughter's\u2014it clicked: Wanda, that was her name. The other was an older man, appearing several decades my junior, or was it somehow meant to be the other way around? His gray beard was a striking contrast to the soft, calloused skin I now saw adorning my own hands, devoid of the familiar wrinkles. He then asked, with the hint of a grin, \"So, how was Heaven?\" The audacity of the question nearly made me chuckle if it wasn\u2019t for the dryness in my throat\u2014no doubt from the pod's feeding fluids. Everyone around called him God\u2014 though surely not the celestial kind\u2014a maker and a guide, roles that only this peculiar place seemed to insist on. \"Better,\" I managed to rasp, recalling, \"Made it to ninety-seven.\" After a dry cough, clearing away the unwanted phlegm, he remarked, \"We watched your journey. A textbook execution.\" Still, I couldn't help but feel there was room for more, \"I'll improve next time.\" This provoked a sigh from Wanda, and with her gesture, memories began to flood back. I closed my eyes, hands tracing my face as if trying to trigger a spark in the once-familiar darkness. \"What did you discover?\" I inquired, curious yet somehow anxious.

Few people apply this idea to the present moment; that we are all always at the start of rippling future-chains of events, and the right small changes can be incredibly valuable. Adam saw the future coming, he saw his opportunity and in seizing it, became a God. He watches us, from above and all around. He provides food and shelter, heals the sick, fills the night sky with stars and colours. And in doing so, He took our freedom, He neutered us. In the preAdamaic era, humankind built technologies as we conceived of them; mechanical advantage brought the earliest levers hoist and cogs, mechanical organization brought clockwork and intricacy, fossil fuel brought brute force, electricity brought power with finesse, radio brought distance, human organization brought factories and supply chains, computers brought interactivity and sensory awareness and Artificial Intelligence. Did you spot the lie? Artificial Intelligence was always on the horizon, but surprise surprise it was n't as easy to conceptualize'water' as it was to pump water, to design a gear system was harder than cutting one out with a LASER. And do n't let me start on the arguments, the armchair philosophising, the endless bullshit end of the world storytelling. All you need to know here is that the streams of ideas merged with Adam's success, and birthed a mighty and humbling river. The cyberpunks wanted head mounted displays, wearable computing, leading to neural connections and direct brain manipulation. The AI amateurs wanted to build a learning computer, and hope it learned to be nice instead of brutally, genocidally indifferent to human concerns. The AI professionals wanted to conceptualise friendliness as a mathematical construct and then build a machine from that. The SciFi authors wanted to scan a human brain into a computer and run it as a simulation. Adam had other plans. He saw the wearable computers as no more than a tool, forever separate and cognitively distant. The neural implants were too new and simplistic to be useful. The radical mathematicalization of human nature was progressing too slowly, and the brain scan of a person would result in... a person. None of these were the kind of transcendence He dreamed of. The first AI would have the first mover advantage. Lots of people thought so, but it was n't discussed enough to see how severe it would be this time. Historically, the first people to develop a new resource, a new invention, conquer a new land, they became rich and powerful.", "text_ai_base": "Everyone was familiar with the butterfly effect\u2014the idea that altering even a small detail from the past could lead to vast and unexpected consequences, creating ripples throughout time. Yet, few consider its relevance to the present moment; we are continually at the starting point of future chains of events, and making small but strategic changes can be extraordinarily valuable. Adam foresaw the future and seized his moment, becoming akin to a deity. He oversees us, omnipresent. He supplies nourishment and shelter, heals the sick, and fills the night sky with stars and colors. In doing so, however, he stripped us of our freedom and stifled our autonomy. Before Adam's reign, humans developed technologies as they imagined them: levers and cogs for mechanical advantage, clockwork complexity, brute force from fossil fuels, finesse with electricity, radio for communication over distance, organized factories and supply chains, interactive computers, and the prospect of Artificial Intelligence. Did you catch the deception? Although AI always seemed imminent, it was far harder to conceptually grasp than practical tasks like pumping water or cutting gears with a laser. Not to mention the endless debates, philosophical musings, and apocalyptic storytelling. What truly matters is how streams of ideas converged with Adam's success, creating a formidable and awe-inspiring force. The cyberpunks sought head-mounted displays and wearable tech, leading to neural interfaces and direct brain manipulation. AI enthusiasts aimed to craft a learning computer, hoping it would become benevolent instead of terrifyingly indifferent to human concerns. AI experts tried to mathematically define friendliness and construct a machine from that concept. Sci-fi writers dreamed of scanning a human brain to run as a computer simulation. Adam had a different vision. To him, wearable computers were merely tools, remaining cognitively detached. Neural implants were too rudimentary to be effective. Mathematically understanding human nature was slow, and scanning a brain would result\u2026 in another person. None of these efforts aligned with the transcendence Adam envisioned. The first AI would secure a pivotal advantage. Many believed this, yet the potential impact wasn't discussed enough to realize its severity this time.

Yet curiously, its importance to the now tends to be overlooked; we stand consistently at the cusp, able to craft futures with seed-like changes that yield enormous benefits. Adam, in his visionary grasp of future paths, seized his opportunity, transforming into a figure almost godlike in stature. He surveys the world with omnipresence, bringing food to the table, roofs overhead, healing where illness strikes, while painting the night sky ablaze with stars and vibrant hues. But this largesse comes at a price\u2014our freedom and self-direction have sputtered under his oversight. In days before Adam commandeered control, humans wove technologies as they conjured them: levers granting mechanical boon, clockwork complexities, coal-driven brute force, electricity's elegant dance, radio's bridging of distant hearts, factories spewing riches, chains of supply weaving patterns, interactive screens leading to Artificial Intelligence's doorstep. Did you catch the sleight of hand? AI, despite its perennial proximity, proved a slippery concept\u2014more elusive than pumping water or slicing gears with precision lasers. And let's not forget those never-ending squabbles over its nature, cerebral meanderings, and tales foreseeing apocalypse. What's crucial is how streams of thought merged with Adam's ascent, crafting a monumental force both awe-inducing and formidable. Cyberpunks chased tech that clung to the body, sparking neural links to puppet the mind's whims. Advocates for AI sought sentient machines, hoping for benevolence over chilly disregard of human plight. Experts grappled with the mathematics of friendliness, eager to birth machines from this paradigm. Sci-fi visionaries imagined mapping a human mind to run like software. Adam? He spun his own web. For him, wearable tech touched merely the surface, leaving cognition untouched. Neural implants moved like rusty gears\u2014too basic for profound impact. Mathematical tales of human nature advanced at the speed of molasses, and brain scans... only yielded another soul. Such pursuits failed to mesh with Adam\u2019s idea of transcendence. Building the inaugural AI, with its potential to hold an undeniable edge, seemed evident\u2014yet its gravitas flew under the radar of discourse.
