Two weeks later on September 2, the Cubs' record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. Then, a Cubs' losing streak converged with a Mets' winning streak. They lost the final two of a series with Cincinnati, and when they returned to Chicago, the lowly yet recently revitalized Pittsburgh Pirates (who were under .500 at the time, but went 39-23 the rest of the way) came to town (they would later finish 3rd). The Cubs lost to the Pirates in a series that saw the Cubs blow leads of 5-2 (lost 9-2) and 4-0 (lost 13-4) in the first two games. Fortunately, they had the lead in the ninth inning of the third game. The Cubs had a chance to stop their three-game skid before the second place Mets came to town for a crucial two-game series. With a runner on second and two outs in the ninth, two strikes away from a victory, Durocher decided to have the Cubs' top relief pitcher, Phil Regan, pitch to Pirates' superstar Willie Stargell. Four pitches later, Stargell put that idea to rest, hitting a pitch onto Sheffield Avenue for a two-run game-tying home run, as the Pirates lost 7-5 in ten innings. The Cubs had now lost four straight, and headed off to Shea Stadium for a brief two-game set with the Mets, in which they lost both games to the surging Mets, bringing their record to an impressive 84-58, but now just 12 game ahead, instead of the 8 game lead they enjoyed before the streak. But the horror was not over, as the Cubs headed to Philadelphia for a two-game set with the fourth place Phillies. The Phillies took both games from the stunned Cubs, who had lost 8 consecutive games. In the September 11 game, with the score tied and a Phillie on first base, Cub pitcher Dick Selma threw to third baseman Ron Santo on a pickoff play. Santo, apparently not expecting a throw from the unpredictable Selma, and standing a good 15 feet from the bag anyway, did not catch the ball.

Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33). People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. \"Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered \"dirty\" by societal standards\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 7). \"In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. \"If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity\" (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).", "text_ai_base": "Research across various traditions increasingly uses the concept of identity to explore different phenomena.

According to Tracy and Trethewey (2005), people are drawn to or avoid certain jobs based partly on whether those roles affirm their \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Trethewey 2005, p. 169). Some occupations carry specific stigmas or levels of esteem. For instance, Tracy explores how correctional officers struggle against the stigma of being perceived as \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Trethewey 2005). The process through which individuals justify and assign value to their occupational choices affects their workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).

Engaging in \"taint management\" goes beyond simply allowing an employee to feel good about their job.

At Seleucia there were 150 bishops, of whom 105 were semi-Arians. These, faithful to their Homoiousion, (see: Homoiousian) would take nothing more or less. Thus there was nothing agreed; and the Prefect of the pretended Council dissolved it. Meantime Acacius, chief of the 'Homoean' party, went to Constantinople; there, in his own way, the Synod of Sirmium was confirmed by the 'Home Synod', that is, the lay-bishops who happened to be at Court; and a sentence was passed against the chiefs of the semi-Arian party. At Rimini over 400 bishops met, 80 of whom were Arians and the rest orthodox. The orthodox fathers would admit of nothing but the Nicene creed, and the others insisted on the Sirmian creed In the end both parties sent deputies to the Emperor, to state to him that no agreement was probable, and to ask him that the bishops might return to their churches. Constantius kept the deputies, and delayed for several months giving them any answer; thus he wearied out the orthodox bishops, and eventually got them to accept the Sirmian creed. Of this Council St. Jerome said: The whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 86, "wordsSpent": 549, "remainingCredits": 270777, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal.", "text_ai_base": "Sleep does not impact the acquisition or recall of memories while we are awake; instead, its greatest influence is on memory consolidation. During sleep, brain neural connections are strengthened, enhancing our ability to stabilize and retain memories.

Insufficient sleep weakens these neural connections, making it difficult to learn and retain information. Sleep deprivation not only hampers focus and learning efficiency but also risks the creation of false memories due to improper memory transfer.

John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well.

He planned a coordinated effort involving both land and naval forces, which historians today regard as creative but too intricate for that era's military capabilities. Philip's forces blocked John\u2019s relief attempt, forcing him to pivot towards Brittany in a bid to divert Philip from eastern Normandy. While John effectively ravaged much of Brittany, he failed to draw Philip's main focus away from Normandy. Historians have differing views on John's military prowess during this campaign, with most recent assessments deeming it adequate but unremarkable. John's position rapidly worsened. Philip and his predecessors had cultivated the eastern Normandy border for years, while Angevin authority in the south had been weakened when Richard granted away key castles earlier. Additionally, John's use of mercenaries, known as routiers, in central regions further eroded his support, paving the way for a swift collapse of Angevin power. John withdrew across the Channel in December, ordering a new defensive line west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard fell in March 1204.

Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in Hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim.

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is\u2014in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention.

Menarche, the onset of menstruation in females, and semenarche, the first ejaculation in males, often serve as key indicators in this transition. However, an adolescent's sexual socialization is also heavily influenced by the cultural stance on teen and premarital sexual activity, which can be either restrictive or permissive. Restrictive cultures discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents, at times enforcing separation of genders during development or using public shaming and physical punishment as deterrents. In contrast, less restrictive cultures may allow more freedom for adolescent sexual expression and interaction between genders in both public and private settings. While some less restrictive cultures may tolerate teenage sexual activity, they might still object to teenage pregnancy unless it occurs after marriage.

By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14\u221217-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15\u201344 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity.

According to a 2002 American study, the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females aged 15\u201344. As teens mature, the duration of their relationships tends to increase as well. This trend can be attributed to sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills needed to maintain romantic bonds, such as caregiving and attachment, although these skills are not fully developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships help adolescents cultivate the skills they need for high-quality relationships later on and foster a sense of self-worth. Overall, positive adolescent romantic relationships can have long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are linked to greater commitment in early adulthood and positively impact self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For instance, adolescents with positive self-confidence often view themselves as successful partners, while negative experiences might lead to low confidence. Adolescents generally date within their demographic based on factors like race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, some traits, especially among girls, encourage seeking diversity. While most adolescents date peers close to their own age, boys usually date partners who are the same age or younger, whereas girls tend to date partners who are the same age or older.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "The onset of adolescents engaging in romantic relationships occurs throughout teenage years. When adolescents reach age of fifteen, 53% become involved in longer term relationships (more than one month) during an 18month period.

Longer term relationships also become longer as adolescences grow older, which might be due to not only the sexual maturation, but also the maturation of cognitive capacity to establish a romantic relationship.

The years leading up to the conquest increased the number of Han Chinese under Manchu rule, leading Hong Taiji to create the Eight Han Banners (zh), and around the time of the Qing takeover of Beijing, their numbers rapidly swelled. Han Bannermen held high status and power in the early Qing period, especially immediately after the conquest during Shunzhi and Kangxi's reign where they dominated Governor-Generalships and Governorships across China at the expense of both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians. Han also numerically dominated the Banners up until the mid 18th century. European visitors in Beijing called them \"Tartarized Chinese\" or \"Tartarified Chinese\". It was in Qianlong's reign that the Qianlong Emperor, concerned about maintaining Manchu identity, re-emphasized Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture in the Eight Banners and started a mass discharge of Han Bannermen from the Eight Banners, either asking them to voluntarily resign from the Banner rolls or striking their names off. This led to a change from Han majority to a Manchu majority within the Banner system, and previous Han Bannermen garrisons in southern China such as at Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen in the purge, which started in 1754. The turnover by Qianlong most heavily impacted Han banner garrisons stationed in the provinces while it less impacted Han Bannermen in Beijing, leaving a larger proportion of remaining Han Bannermen in Beijing than the provinces. Han Bannermen's status was decreased from that point on with Manchu Banners gaining higher status. Han Bannermen numbered 75% in 1648 Shunzhi's reign, 72% in 1723 Yongzheng's reign, but decreased to 43% in 1796 during the first year of Jiaqing's reign, which was after Qianlong's purge. The mass discharge was known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners (zh). Qianlong directed most of his ire at those Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after the Qing passed through the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, deeming their ancestors as traitors to the Ming and therefore untrustworthy, while retaining Han Bannermen who were descended from defectors who joined the Qing before 1644 in Liaodong and marched through Shanhai pass, also known as those who \"followed the Dragon through the pass\" (\u5f9e\u9f8d\u5165\u95dc; cong long ru guan).", "text_ai_base": "The Banner Armies of the Qing dynasty were structured based on ethnic lines, primarily consisting of Manchu and Mongol groups, but they also included non-Manchu bondservants registered under their Manchu masters' households. As the Qing approached their conquest, the number of Han Chinese under Manchu rule grew significantly. To address this, Hong Taiji established the Eight Han Banners. Around the time of the Qing's capture of Beijing, the Han Chinese numbers in these Banners rapidly increased. In the early Qing period, particularly during the reigns of Shunzhi and Kangxi, Han Bannermen held significant status and power, often dominating positions such as Governor-Generalships and Governorships, overshadowing both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians. The Han outnumbered other groups within the Banners until the mid-18th century. European visitors in Beijing referred to them as \"Tartarized Chinese\" or \"Tartarified Chinese.\" During Emperor Qianlong's reign, concerned about preserving Manchu identity, there was a renewed focus on Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture within the Eight Banners. This led to a large-scale removal of Han Bannermen, beginning in 1754, with many being asked to resign or having their names removed from the Banner rolls. Consequently, the Banner system shifted from a Han majority to a Manchu majority. Han garrisons in southern China, such as those in Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, and Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen. The turnover severely affected provincial Han Banner garrisons but had less impact on those in Beijing, where a higher proportion of Han Bannermen remained. From this period onward, the status of Han Bannermen diminished as Manchu Banners rose in prominence. During Shunzhi's reign in 1648, 75% of Bannermen were Han, which dropped to 72% in 1723 during Yongzheng's reign, and further to 43% in 1796, at the start of Jiaqing's reign after Qianlong's purge, known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners. Qianlong specifically targeted Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after they breached the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, viewing them as traitors to the Ming and distrustful. However, he retained those descended from defectors who joined the Qing prior to 1644 in Liaodong and participated in the passage through Shanhai Pass, who were known as those who \"followed the Dragon through the pass.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "The Qing\u2019s Banner forces was organized by ethnicity; most troops were Manchu or Mongol, yet they also kept non\u2011Manchu bond\u2011servants listed under their Manchu masters\u2019 households.

(See Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea, Ch\u014dsen-seibatsu (\u671d\u9bae\u5f81\u4f10?). Taking advantage of arquebus mastery and extensive wartime experience from the Sengoku period, Japanese samurai armies made major gains in most of Korea. Kato Kiyomasa advanced to Orangkai territory (present-day Manchuria) bordering Korea to the northeast and crossed the border into Manchuria, but withdrew after retaliatory attacks from the Jurchens there, as it was clear he had outpaced the rest of the Japanese invasion force. A few of the more famous samurai generals of this war were Kat\u014d Kiyomasa, Konishi Yukinaga, and Shimazu Yoshihiro. Shimazu Yoshihiro led some 7,000 samurai and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated a host of allied Ming and Korean forces at the Battle of Sacheon in 1598, near the conclusion of the campaigns. Yoshihiro was feared as Oni-Shimazu (\"Shimazu ogre\") and his nickname spread across not only Korea but to Ming Dynasty China. In spite of the superiority of Japanese land forces, ultimately the two expeditions failed (though they did devastate the Korean landmass) from factors such as Korean naval superiority (which, led by Admiral Yi Sun-shin, harassed Japanese supply lines continuously throughout the wars, resulting in supply shortages on land), the commitment of sizeable Ming forces to Korea, Korean guerrilla actions, the underestimation of resistance by Japanese commanders (in the first campaign of 1592, Korean defenses on land were caught unprepared, under-trained, and under-armed; they were rapidly overrun, with only a limited number of successfully resistant engagements against the more-experienced and battle-hardened Japanese forces - in the second campaign of 1597, Korean and Ming forces proved to be a far more difficult challenge and, with the support of continued Korean naval superiority, limited Japanese gains to parts southeastern Korea), and wavering Japanese commitment to the campaigns as the wars dragged on. The final death blow to the Japanese campaigns in Korea came with Hideyoshi's death in late 1598 and the recall of all Japanese forces in Korea by the Council of Five Elders (established by Hideyoshi to oversee the transition from his regency to that of his son Hideyori).", "text_ai_base": "In 1592 and again in 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi sought to invade China by way of Korea, deploying an army of 160,000 peasants and samurai.

Despite the Japanese army's superiority on land, both military expeditions ultimately failed for several reasons. These included the Korean navy's dominance, led by Admiral Yi Sun-shin, who disrupted Japanese supply lines, the deployment of substantial Ming forces to aid Korea, local guerrilla actions, and the Japanese commanders' misjudgment of Korean resistance. While the first 1592 campaign saw unprepared Korean land defenses overwhelmed by experienced Japanese troops, the second 1597 campaign met far stronger Korean and Ming resistance, aided by continued naval superiority, limiting Japanese gains to southeastern Korea.

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a \"blank tablet\", in Locke's words \"white paper\", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes.

He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion.

Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves.

The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages.

The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa.

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples.

This leads parties to collaborate and form coalition governments. This trend has been notable in the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is a consistent occurrence in Germany at both national and state levels, as well as in most local constituencies. Since its establishment, the Republic of Iceland has never seen a non-coalition government, typically led by the Independence Party and another party, often the Social Democratic Alliance. A similar scenario exists in the Republic of Ireland, where no party has governed alone since 1989, resulting in numerous coalition governments, primarily led by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Coalition governments can often facilitate political change more effectively than one-party or two-party systems. In a two-party system, if there are fundamental disagreements on policy or principles, adjustments can be slow, as seen in the U.S. with Democrats and Republicans currently sharing power. However, coalition governments can also struggle for years to implement changes and may fail, as seen in post-World War II France and Italy. When one party in a two-party system controls all branches of government, policy changes can occur rapidly and significantly. This was the case for Democrats like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson, as well as Republicans such as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.

Some, like domestic cats and dogs hunt both large and small prey in relation to themselves and will eat a very large insect whole but tear up or chew a large mammal. Some even use venom to either kill, like box jellyfish, or disable their prey, like cone shells. Also, the venom of some predators, like rattlesnakes and some spiders, also digest the prey even before they begin eating it. In some cases, the prey dies in the jaws or gullet of the predator, as in the purses of baleen whales which eat millions of plankton at once, which die a short time after being jammed and broken up in the whale's mouth. In addition, egg and seed predation are valid forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs are potential organisms. Not every true predator eats every part of its prey. For example, some predators cannot digest bone and some can. Some predators may eat only part of an organism as in grazing yet directly cause its death.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 82, "wordsSpent": 504, "remainingCredits": 233567, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Its resulting agency, the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity is considered the precursor of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . 10 Executive Order 10925 was amended and subsequently superseded by Executive Order 11246 issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 24, 1965, that required federal contractors \"not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, and national origin make rapist. \"MS text says because of sex, but the Executive Order itself added sex as a provision two years later. .\"[9][10] In 1967, sex was added to the anti-discrimination now required of contractors. Despite some conservative opposition, proposed modifications or revisions to Executive Order 11246 by the Reagan administration were confronted and differed by both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 85, "wordsSpent": 572, "remainingCredits": 231210, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Over the past few years, BYU has dismissed a few players (who were on athletic scholarship) from its teams for violating the honor code.[353][354] BYU's athletic program also holds the distinction of being the only NCAA program to have each athletic team receive at least one national championship title. In the 2011 season, BYU became independent in college football. The Cougars left the Mountain West Conference at the end of the 2010\u201311 season and have joined the West Coast Conference for most of its non-football sports as of 2011. The only exceptions to this are the aforementioned sports that already compete in other conferences, sports that the WCC does not sponsor (notably softball, which belonged to the WAC until 2012 and will move to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference afterward ),[355] and the BYU men's and women's swimming and diving teams and men's and women's indoor track and field teams, all of which also joined the MPSF alongside men's (outdoor) soccer.[356] The BYU men's and women's outdoor track and field teams became independent as well following the school's departure from the MW. Also, after spending the 2012 season in the PCSC, Cougars softball may be headed elsewhere after the 2013 season, as the conference announced in October 2012 that it will disband after that season. This became all but certain after Pacific, a charter member of the WCC, announced that it would return to that conference in July 2013. With the Tigers in the WCC fold, the conference will likely add softball, which it does not currently sponsor, in the near future.[357]", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 87, "wordsSpent": 855, "remainingCredits": 227285, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \"kef\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \"kef music\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia.

The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.

These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August).

On 2 August 1921, in the aftermath of the assassination of the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, by a young communist, the Communist Party was declared illegal under the Yugoslav State Security Act of 1921, and the Communist MPs' mandates were nullified.[16][36] After the banning of the Communist party, Tito continued his illegal Communist party work in Yugoslavia. At the end of 1920, Tito moved to Veliko Trojstvo near Bjelovar, where he was employed as a machinist.[37] In 1925, he moved to Kraljevica where he got a job in a shipyard. There he was elected as a union leader and during 1926, he led a shipyard strike. He subsequently lost his job and moved to Belgrade. After his efforts to organize strikes in a train coach factory in Smederevska Palanka failed, he returned to Zagreb, where he was appointed secretary of the Metal Workers' Union of Croatia. In July 1928, he was appointed by the Zagreb Branch of the CPY to be their representative at the 4th Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Dresden. On 4 November 1928, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Petrinjska Street prison where he spent several months.[38][39] In 1929, he was convicted of being a member of the then-illegal Communist Party of Yugoslavia and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.[40] He served out his sentence in Lepoglava and Maribor, where he became acquainted with Mo\u0161a Pijade, who was to become his ideological mentor.[41] During his prison term he adopted the nom de guerre \"Tito\".[42] Stalinist purge wave (1936\u20131940) [ edit ] Image of the Moscow Trials where many of the accused and executed Yugoslav communists were co-defendants. It was during this period that Tito became closely intertwined with the Soviets' WKP(B) and delegate to the Comintern. After his release, he lived in Samobor, where he started a career as a communist functionary. In 1934 he became General Secretary of the CPY.[43] During his period in revolutionary underground activity within the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Tito assumed various code names. \"Walter\" was one; \"Tito\" was another.

The UK operates under the Westminster system, which is characterized by parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government. In this system, Parliament, which includes the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, is the ultimate lawmaking body. The executive branch and judiciary functioned in the name of the King, referred to as \"His Majesty's Government.\" Most of the King's Ministers were members of either the House of Lords or the House of Commons, and the government needed the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, simultaneously served as the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. As a result, the separation of powers in the British government was often not strictly observed, even though conflicts between different branches did occur. Similarly, some U.S. states in the 18th century did not strictly separate powers. For example, New Jersey's Governor also served on the state's highest court and presided over one house of the legislature. In Delaware, the President was a member of the Court of Appeals, and legislative leaders served in the executive role as Vice Presidents. Delaware and Pennsylvania had executive council members who also served as judges.

George V's reign saw the palace host the first of three command performances: jazz musicians, notably the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919), the first jazz band to play for a head of state[45] and, later, such jazz musicians as Sidney Bechet (1932) and Louis Armstrong (1932), and its nomination, in 2009, for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival for its services to jazz.[45] refname=\"kind of blue\"/ Queen Mary was interested in the arts[46] and Buckingham Palace became the home of the Royal Collection's greatest treasures and masterpieces. Queen Mary was also an eager and competent curator of her collection.[46] A grande dame issime, she arranged the installation of a collection of miniatures in the new Bow Room on the ground floor (the large central room on the garden fa\u00e7ade).[46] The queen also planned and furnished a series of rooms on the second floor at the north end of the palace with chintz fabric and comfortable arm chairs known as \"the chintz rooms\" and furnished with some of her favourite pieces of art. Another of Queen Mary's additions was the pair of Empire-style marble chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy with carving by Paul Storr from Carlton House in the Bow Room.[47] Also during this period, in the Blue Drawing Room, the tall windows were altered so that they were filled in with mirrors to allow for wall space. Formerly known as the South Drawing Room, redesigned by Nash in time for Queen Victoria's accession. This is one of the most lavishly decorated rooms in the palace and is the first room on the tour of the state rooms. The ceiling is of gilt and white plaster designed by Nash featuring a coffered design with huge gilt console brackets, a central skylight and trompe-l'\u0153il clouds.[48]", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 84, "wordsSpent": 696, "remainingCredits": 212779, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea.

This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002).

For example, minor genetic variations in a vasopressin receptor gene among voles (Microtus spp.) correspond to significant differences in species-specific social organization and mating systems (Hammock & Young 2005). Another example is the FOCP2 gene, which affects neural circuits related to speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). This gene's form in humans, which has only slightly mutated from its chimpanzee version, has been around for approximately 200,000 years, aligning with the emergence of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002).

Eddie Condon explained: \"Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development.\" The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: \"Carnegie Drag\" was 3:15; \"Carnegie Jump\", 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: \"Embraceable You\" was 4:05; \"Serenade to a Shylock\", 4:32. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded \"Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean\", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records. An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\" in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Soliloquy\", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946. Because it ran 7:57, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record.

Another way to overcome time constraints was by splitting a song across both sides of a record. For instance, vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded \"Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean\" by Irving and Jack Kaufman as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo. A more evident solution for longer pieces was releasing multiple records as a set. HMV in England made the first complete opera recording with Verdi's Ernani in 1903, using 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\" in four parts, across two 12-inch 78s.

Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue \u00d6yster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts.

For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development.

Empirical studies suggest that this phase is better described as identity development rather than formation, highlighting a normative change in thoughts about the self's content and structure.

Since identity is a virtual thing, it is impossible to define it empirically. Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings, from fundamental and abiding sameness, to fluidity, contingency, negotiated and so on. Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 5). Indeed, many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity, following more or less the frameworks listed above, rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality. In this environment, some analysts, such as Brubaker and Cooper, have suggested doing away with the concept completely (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 1). Others, by contrast, have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression. Hall (1992, 1996), for example, suggests treating identity as a process, to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience. Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification, whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified' and interpreted by individuals. The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with. Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity.", "text_ai_base": "Explorations of 'identity' reveal the concept's complexity and elusive nature. Being virtual, identity cannot be empirically defined. The term 'identity' carries various meanings in discussions, ranging from stable sameness to changeable, contingent aspects subject to negotiation. Brubaker and Cooper highlight that many scholars often blur the lines between viewing identity as a practical category and an analytical one (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 5). Indeed, researchers frequently rely on their preconceived notions of identity, adhering to established frameworks, rather than focusing on how identity manifests in reality. In this context, some analysts, including Brubaker and Cooper, propose abandoning the concept altogether (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 1). Conversely, others suggest alternative ideas to better capture the dynamic and fluid nature of human social expression.

The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose \"Fog on the Tyne\" was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians.

However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction.", "text_ai_base": "Observing the short-term effects of a predator on its prey species can be difficult.

This reduction in predators allows the few remaining prey to slowly rebuild their numbers, eventually restoring their previous abundance, which in turn supports a rebound in the predator population as resources become more available. If predators drive prey species to critically low numbers, this can result in both the prey's extinction and the predators'\u2014a phenomenon known as coextinction. Wildlife conservationists face this risk when introducing predators to environments where prey species have not coevolved with similar predators. The extent of this risk depends on the prey's ability to adapt quickly to the new predator. One way to mitigate this risk is by providing an alternative prey species, though ecologists typically avoid this strategy. An alternative prey can reduce predatory pressure on the original prey, giving them a chance to recover.

Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages.

Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments.

Through experimenting with different styles to align their self-image with the perceptions of others, adolescents gain insight into their identities. Just as fashion evolves to influence adolescents, so does media exposure. \"Modern life unfolds amidst an unending stream of images on screens, pages, and billboards,\" which affects self-image and, consequently, an adolescent\u2019s sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed a method for assessing progress through these stages, using questions in categories like occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Responses are assessed based on exploration depth and level of commitment, classifying individuals as: a) identity diffusion, which is the initial state for all children, b) identity foreclosure, where commitments are made without exploring alternatives, c) moratorium, which involves exploration, or d) identity achievement, where exploration leads to commitments.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Egocentrism in adolescence is the adolescent's conscious interest in feeling unique and accepted by their peers.

However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root.

Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.", "text_ai_base": "Using diagrams to illustrate the interaction of a few particles in spacetime, Feynman developed models for all of physics based on the spins of these particles and the range of coupling among fundamental forces.

The connection between the two models was unclear, with Gell-Mann mockingly calling Feynman's partons \"put-ons.\" During the mid-1960s, many physicists considered quarks mere tools for tracking symmetry, not actual particles. This skepticism arose because the Omega-minus particle, if viewed as a bound state of three identical strange quarks, seemed theoretically impossible. However, experiments at the Stanford linear accelerator in the late 1960s, similar to Rutherford's 1911 alpha particle gold nucleus scattering, revealed that nucleons had point-like particles scattering electrons. These were naturally identified as quarks, yet Feynman's parton model aimed to interpret the findings without new hypotheses. The data indicated that about 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles within the nucleon. Today, we recognize these particles as gluons, which mediate forces between quarks and carry a three-valued color charge that resolves the Omega-minus issue.

Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related \u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant \u2014 the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact.

Elevator doors can sometimes fail to open, giving the passengers the idea that the elevator is plunging, when the opposite is the case -- it is not even moving.

Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in 1978. However, due to industrialisation in recent decades, Valencia has attracted immigration from other regions in Spain, and hence there is also a demographic factor for its declining social use. Due to a combination of these reasons, Valencia has become the bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, which celebrates Valencian as merely folkloric, but rejects the existing standard which was adapted from Catalan orthography.

He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience.

Popper argued that World Three, much like animal paths are the results of the actions of individual animals, is the product of human activity and evolves independently of individual minds. He believed that World Three impacts the human mind (World Two) as strongly as the physical world (World One) does. Thus, an individual's knowledge is influenced significantly by the accumulation of human knowledge as much as by direct experience.

The humanists' impact on this infrastructure can be found in their influence on the content of what was being taught and how it was being taught. Humanism and universities\u2014humanists were interested in reforming the universities existing curriculum. Humanists began to enter the university once they became teachers of the studia humanitatis in the university; meanwhile, the lower level university faculty incorporated the humanistic grammar and rhetoric into their educational programs. Additionally, professors were at times humanists themselves, and they further the humanist cause in their teachings. The teaching of grammar and rhetoric \u2013developed into the teaching of humanist moral philosophy in universities and paved the way for the slow integration of humanism into universities. By 1500, humanist professors secured a majority of the chairs of grammar and rhetoric. Many of the most distinguished early modern scientists were professors at the universities and gained their interest in science through their studies of the arts in the universities. The model of scientific inquiry used was Aristotelian. The professors of philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and theology produced and taught the significant scientific and philosophical works of the early modern period. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Humanists, including historians and poets, advised on the calendar reform, acted as consultants on navigation, and aided in the development of surveying, cartography, astronomy, and the military art. The legacy of training that was carried forward into the modern world by early modern scientists was a web of connections to universities, teaching, and book learning.

Natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric were the main subjects of focus. Aristotle was pervasive throughout the curriculum, with Galen and Arabic medicine being taught for medicine. The humanists' impact on this infrastructure can be found in their influence on the content of what was being taught and how it was being taught. Humanism and universities\u2014humanists were interested in reforming the universities existing curriculum. Humanists began to enter the university once they became teachers of the studia humanitatis in the university; meanwhile, the lower level university faculty incorporated the humanistic grammar and rhetoric into their educational programs. Additionally, professors were at times humanists themselves, and they further the humanist cause in their teachings. The teaching of grammar and rhetoric \u2013developed into the teaching of humanist moral philosophy in universities and paved the way for the slow integration of humanism into universities. By 1500, humanist professors secured a majority of the chairs of grammar and rhetoric. Many of the most distinguished early modern scientists were professors at the universities and gained their interest in science through their studies of the arts in the universities. The model of scientific inquiry used was Aristotelian. The professors of philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and theology produced and taught the significant scientific and philosophical works of the early modern period. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Humanists, including historians and poets, advised on the calendar reform, acted as consultants on navigation, and aided in the development of surveying, cartography, astronomy, and the military art. The legacy of training that was carried forward into the modern world by early modern scientists was a web of connections to universities, teaching, and book learning. Existing curricula began to incorporate the humanist approach to science, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and live honorable lives. Other professors within the university were significantly influenced by the humanists' emphasis on ancient texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as a translator and advocate of the important texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance, Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist tradition before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he later verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective, while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were indispensable to his reputation as a jurist. Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly important guide for connecting with the original spirit of the Reformation, especially the theology of the Protestant universities. Galileo Galilei, a lecturer in mathematics at Pisa and Padua and Martin Luther, a lecturer in theology at Wittenberg were two notable teachers and alumni of the early modern university. Galilei and Luther were both heavily influenced by their studies as humanist scholars. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to teach in the departments of grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy. The initial curriculum goal was to train future humanists, but the study of ancient texts slowly raised the importance of science and brought about the inclusion of the scientific disciplines in the curriculum.

One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs.

Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.", "text_ai_base": "In Trinidad and Tobago, there is a strong tradition of hunting small to medium-sized wild game.

He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt. However, according to the Greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece. A modern theory derives the name Greek (Latin Graeci) from Graikos, \"inhabitant of Graia/Graea,\" a town on the coast of Boeotia. Greek colonists from Graia helped to found Cumae (900 BC) in Italy, where they were called Graeces. When the Romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all Greeks (Graeci.) The word \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 graia \"old woman\" comes from the PIE root *\u01f5erh2-/*\u01f5reh2-, \"to grow old\" via Proto-Greek *gera-/grau-iu; the same root later gave \u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 geras (/keras/), \"gift of honour\" in Mycenean Greek. The Germanic languages borrowed the word Greeks with an initial \"k\" sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the Latin \"g\" at the time (Goth. Kreks). The area out of ancient Attica including Boeotia was called Gra\u00efke and is connected with the older deluge of Ogyges, the mythological ruler of Boeotia.

Aristotle notes in Meteorologica I.xiv that the Hellenes were related to the Grai or Greeks, a name used by a Dorian tribe in Epirus, adopted by the Illyrians. He also suggests that the great deluge likely occurred around Dodona, home to the Selloi. Yet, Greek tradition often places the Greek homeland originally in central Greece. A modern theory posits that the name Greek (Latin Graeci) derives from Graikos, meaning \"inhabitant of Graia/Graea,\" a coastal town in Boeotia. Colonists from Graia founded Cumae in Italy around 900 BC, where they were called Graeces. The Romans later used this name for all Greeks (Graeci). The word \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 (graia), meaning \"old woman,\" traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root *\u01f5erh2-/*\u01f5reh2-, meaning \"to grow old,\" via Proto-Greek *gera-/grau-iu.

Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols.

Loring Brace, along with philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and geneticist Joseph Graves, have suggested that while biological and genetic variation can indeed align with what are traditionally called \"continental races,\" this pattern is observable in almost all geographically distinct populations. The way genetic data clusters is largely influenced by researchers' initial hypotheses and the populations they sample. For example, when continental groups are sampled, the resulting clusters are continental in nature. Different sampling methods would produce different clusters. Weiss and Fullerton point out that if only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris were sampled, three distinct genetic clusters would emerge, and other populations could be described as mixtures of these three groups. Kaplan and Winther argue that, from this perspective, both Lewontin and Edwards are correct in their discussions. They conclude that, although racial groups are identified by varying allele frequencies, this doesn't imply that racial classification is a natural categorization of humans, because numerous genetic patterns exist that go beyond racial distinctions. Additionally, genomic data does not decisively determine whether one prefers subdivisions (splitters) or a continuum (lumpers). According to Kaplan and Winther, racial groupings are objective social constructs that possess biological significance only when categories are intentionally selected and constructed for scientific purposes.

The fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance in the transept is in the same style. It was made at the beginning of the 18th century by the German Konrad Rudolf.

The additions at the rear of the cathedral detract from the appearance of height. During the 18th-century restoration the pointed arches were rounded, the Gothic columns were walled up and fresh pillars with Corinthian capitals put in, and the walls were redecorated. The dome is without a lantern and has a flat roof. There are two windows, one on each side. There are four chapels on each side, besides the one at the end, and those which open into the choir, transept, and sanctuary, and there are many fine paintings by eminent artists. The reredos behind the altar is a copy in wood of the one in silver which was carried away by the French in the war of 1808 and melted down to facilitate the transport of the metal. Of the original panel preserved, the Resurrection was painted by Fernando Y\u00e1\u00f1ez de la Almedina (who subsequently worked on the panels of the high altar of Cuenca Cathedral) under the direction of Cardinal Cisneros, archbishop of Toledo.

The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968). As third party movements have learned, the Electoral College's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. Wallace had weak support outside the South. More generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the U.S.'s largely single-member district, winner-take-all elections.

However the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: \"An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.\" More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with \u201cdesirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.\u201d For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food.

The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\"pastoral poetry\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\" uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Virgil is credited[by whom?] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus, and later writers.", "text_ai_base": "According to biographical tradition, Virgil began composing the hexameter *Eclogues* (or *Bucolics*) in 42 BC, with the collection likely published around 39\u201338 BC, though this timing is debated. The *Eclogues*, meaning \"selections\" in Greek, consist of ten poems inspired by the pastoral hexameter poetry of Theocritus, a Hellenistic poet. After Octavian's triumph at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC against the forces that assassinated Julius Caesar, he sought to compensate his veterans with land seized from northern Italian towns. Tradition suggests Virgil's own estate near Mantua was among these confiscated lands. As a result, it has long been believed that Virgil wrote the *Eclogues* to reclaim his lost family farm through poetic appeal, although this interpretation lacks strong evidence. In *Eclogues* 1 and 9, Virgil indeed captures the upheaval caused by land expropriations using pastoral themes but provides no definitive account of his personal experience in these events. Readers have sometimes linked the poet to his characters, whether it\u2019s the grateful elder to a new god in *Eclogue 1*, a singer\u2019s unrequited love in *Eclogue 2*, or a master singer\u2019s claim in *Eclogue 5*. However, modern scholars dismiss attempts to extract biographical facts from fiction, opting to view these characters and themes as reflections of contemporary thought and daily life. The *Eclogues* blend traditional pastoral themes with new insights. *Eclogues* 1 and 9 focus on the impact of land seizures in Italy. *Eclogues* 2 and 3 weave pastoral and erotic themes, exploring homosexual love in *Eclogue 2* and broader romantic attraction in *Eclogue 3*. In *Eclogue 4*, dedicated to Asinius Pollio and often dubbed the \"Messianic Eclogue,\" Virgil invokes imagery of a golden age tied to the birth of a child, sparking debate on the child\u2019s identity. *Eclogues* 5 and 8 recount the myth of Daphnis in a singing contest, *Eclogue 6* features the cosmic song of Silenus, *Eclogue 7* presents a fervent poetic rivalry, and *Eclogue 10* reveals the struggles of the elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus.

Makdisi identifies eighteen such parallels between Islamic education and modern university terminology. Common university practices today, such as inaugural lectures, wearing academic robes, defending a thesis to earn a doctorate, and even the notion of academic freedom, all have roots in Islamic traditions. The Islamic scholarly practices of fatw\u00e1 (opinion) and ijm\u0101\u02bb (consensus) laid the groundwork for Western scholarly systems from the Middle Ages onward. According to Makdisi and Goddard, the concept of academic freedom in universities mirrors the Islamic customs of the medieval madrasa system of the 9th century.

The system of academic ranks are also similar to the Islamic system of isnad and ijazah. For example, the term fellow is derived from the Arabic term a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b (\"companions, as of Muhammad\"); the term written examination is derived from the Arabic term imtih\u0101n; and the term candidate is derived from the Arabic term \u1e6d\u0101lib, meaning \"student.\" This is similar to the way in which words from Arabic or Islamic origin can be found in many European languages. According to Turner, however, the terms \"reading\" and \"fellow\" were introduced into the \"vocabulary of the learned in Europe\" with \"their use in specific scholarly contexts in the seventeenth century.\" There are a number of other terms and practices from the Islamic madrasah which influenced the early European university including, for example, the \"class\" of scholars as the Turkish ulama, the terms bachelor (Arabic: bakk\u0101l\u012b) and specialist (Arabic: takha\u1e63\u1e63us), and the practice of changing clothes depending on the subject one teaches. However, Makdisi criticizes Turner for \"failing to distinguish between recipient, beneficiary, lender\"; thus, he concludes that even though \"a word, a library, a hospital, or an astrolabe,\" for example, may have existed \"in ancient Greece, or Rome, or India,\" this \"does not mean that the objector some practice connected with it was transmitted, much less that it lent itself to revival.\" Makdisi also suggests that the medieval ijazah resembles somewhat, the modern university bachelor\u2019s degree. The madrasa is one of the relics that influenced the establishment of the Western university. There were originally three academic ranks beneath the professorial rank, this was supplemented around the 9th century by the use of the term \"reader,\" which referred to the intermediate rank of associate professor. The term reading is translated from the 9th-century Arabic term, qir\u0101\u02bcah, while the equivalent of a thesis in the 12th-century Islamic jadal (lit. \"disputation, argument, debate\"; from Greek \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, dialektike) is a \"position\" or \"statement\" (called maq\u0101lah) which is \"defended by the student, who, rather than finding a patron... has to undergo rigorous examination in order to obtain a teaching certificate.\" According to Makdisi, \"the teachers of law in fifth-century Islamic society, along with their students, developed a system of education which reappeared five or six hundred years later in the medieval universities from which our modern system of education is derived. The classical university of the Middle Ages, and of modern times, is thus a Latinized imitation of the medieval madrasa; and, like the madrasa, it could exist anywhere, independently of the presence of the ancient classics, for which humanists devoted so much of their energies, and which exist in Islamic civilization, but had no place in Islamic law.\" He lists eighteen such parallels in terminology between the Islamic institutions and the Western universities system whereof, as just mentioned, \u2018reading\u2019 is one; also inaugural lecture, the wearing of academic robes, obtaining of a license or a degree, and the practices of academic freedom, the defense, and the doctoral degrees have their roots in the Islamic tradition. The practice of inaugurating a course, as well as the inaugural lecture was an Islamic administrative practice, while the idea of academic freedom was an Islamic concept that was borrowed into the planning of the University of Naples Frederico II, the first intentionally planned university in Europe. The concept of acadeic freedom in universities was based on the Islamic customs of the medieval madrasa system. The idea of academic freedom which is known in the modern university as the right of scholars to make scholarly judgments without pressure, is closely aligned to the Islamic fatw\u00e1, meaning opinion, and ijm\u0101\u02bb, meaning scholarly consensus, and is one of the essential features of the Western university system today.

There were originally three academic ranks beneath the professorial rank, this was supplemented around the 9th century by the use of the term \"reader,\" which referred to the intermediate rank of associate professor. The term reading is translated from the 9th-century Arabic term, qir\u0101\u02bcah, while the equivalent of a thesis in the 12th-century Islamic jadal (lit. \"disputation, argument, debate\"; from Greek \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, dialektike) is a \"position\" or \"statement\" (called maq\u0101lah) which is \"defended by the student, who, rather than finding a patron... has to undergo rigorous examination in order to obtain a teaching certificate.\" According to Makdisi, \"the teachers of law in fifth-century Islamic society, along with their students, developed a system of education which reappeared five or six hundred years later in the medieval universities from which our modern system of education is derived. The classical university of the Middle Ages, and of modern times, is thus a Latinized imitation of the medieval madrasa; and, like the madrasa, it could exist anywhere, independently of the presence of the ancient classics, for which humanists devoted so much of their energies, and which exist in Islamic civilization, but had no place in Islamic law.\" He lists eighteen such parallels in terminology between the Islamic institutions and the Western universities system whereof, as just mentioned, \u2018reading\u2019 is one; also inaugural lecture, the wearing of academic robes, obtaining of a license or a degree, and the practices of academic freedom, the defense, and the doctoral degrees have their roots in the Islamic tradition. The practice of inaugurating a course, as well as the inaugural lecture was an Islamic administrative practice, while the idea of academic freedom was an Islamic concept that was borrowed into the planning of the University of Naples Frederico II, the first intentionally planned university in Europe. The concept of acadeic freedom in universities was based on the Islamic customs of the medieval madrasa system. The idea of academic freedom which is known in the modern university as the right of scholars to make scholarly judgments without pressure, is closely aligned to the Islamic fatw\u00e1, meaning opinion, and ijm\u0101\u02bb, meaning scholarly consensus, and is one of the essential features of the Western university system today. Muslim influence was \"certainly discernible\" in the establishment of the first deliberately planned university in Europe, the University of Naples Federico II, in 1224, where, for the first time in Europe, the distinctions between the bachelor's degree and the doctoral degree began to appear.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 89, "wordsSpent": 973, "remainingCredits": 159095, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place.

While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals \u2013 this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves.

Some mammals are carnivorous and consume other animals, including insects. Herbivores, on the other hand, eat plants, with subcategories like fruit-eating and grass-eating diets. Omnivores eat both animals and plants. Carnivores have a straightforward digestive system because proteins, lipids, and minerals in meat require minimal specialized digestion. In contrast, plants contain complex carbohydrates like cellulose, so herbivores have digestive tracts equipped with bacteria to ferment these substances and aid digestion. These bacteria reside either in multi-chambered stomachs or a large cecum. An animal's size also influences its dietary adaptation. Smaller mammals have a higher ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, resulting in increased energy demands and a rapid metabolism. Thus, mammals weighing less than about 18 ounces (500 grams) are typically insectivorous, as they cannot manage the slow, complex digestion required for a herbivorous diet. Conversely, larger mammals generate more heat and lose less of it, allowing them to tolerate either a slower prey collection process or the lengthy digestion typical of herbivores.

Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses).

An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a dog among alligators, a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray, or a snapping turtle among jaguars; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default.", "text_ai_base": "Predators often serve as prey for other animals, while those designated as prey can also be predators.

On 1 July 1858, the papers by Wallace and Darwin were read on On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. Darwin's paper was titled \"An abstract from an unpublished work on Species by C. Darwin, Esq., consisting of a portion of a chapter entitled \"On the variation of organic beings in a state of nature; on the natural means of selection; on the comparison of domestic races; and on the conditions favourable to the formation of new species\", and written July 1837.[55] Wallace's paper was titled \"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type\". Papers read to the Linnean Society were not discussed at the meetings, so no debate occurred, but the president of the society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries; and Darwin wrote \"our joint productions excited very little attention, & the only published notice of them was by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that 'all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old.'\".[56] Wallace's paper was titled \"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type\". Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection; historians have noted differences. Darwin described natural selection among individual variations, emphasizing competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding of animals, and Darwin pictured no role for ecological pressures while Wallace focused on pressures that kept varieties adapted to local conditions. Wallace appears to have been discussing group selection rather than individual variation.[57][58]", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 82, "wordsSpent": 787, "remainingCredits": 148830, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's \"pre purification\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature.

Sophronius of Jerusalem offered a pivotal interpretation of Nazianzen's ideas, explaining that Mary was already immaculate at the time of the Annunciation. He even suggested that John the Baptist was \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman,\" acknowledging that Mary's extraordinary holiness eclipsed even John's, who was sanctified in utero. Sophronius' teachings were further developed by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750), who praised Mary for her purification at the Annunciation and uniquely recognized her role in \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them,\" an honor traditionally reserved for Christ, according to Nazianzen's legacy. Damascene elaborated on the parallel holiness between Mary's prepurification and Jesus' purification in the New Testament, likening her holiness at the Annunciation to Christ's baptism at the Jordan.

In the 1880s, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that \"the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.\" In 1888, Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889. The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor. The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor.

Throughout the 1880s, inventors aimed to develop AC motors, as AC was beneficial for long-distance, high-voltage transmission but lacked operable motors. Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla independently invented the first AC commutatorless induction motors, with Ferraris presenting a working model in 1885 and Tesla in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris' research on motor operation but doubted its commercial potential.

This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels.

The edict was harshly enforced: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; to keep your head, you cut the hair.\"[30] For the Manchus, the policy was a test of loyalty and a mark of acceptance of Manchu authority. For Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliation because traditional teachings held that people should not alter their bodies, as they were gifts from their parents. Under the Ming, Han Chinese wore their hair in a top-knot and wore no head-shaving.[31] The Qing hairstyle was symbolic of submission to the new dynasty. This edict triggered widespread resistance to Qing rule, especially in the former Ming capital of Jiankang (Nanjing), whose residents attacked anyone who had a queue. During the ensuing Jiangnan massacres, these Han Chinese killed many Han who had surrendered to the Qing. The Nanjing Han population was later massacred or driven into the countryside. Han Chinese Defectors who joined the Qing slaughtered Han Chinese resisters to the Qing. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within one month, resulting in tens of thousands deaths. At the end of the third massacre, there was hardly a living person left in this city. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days. It was estimated that 74,000 inhabitants were killed when the city fell on 9 October 1645. Another massacre was conducted in Changzhou. Although Dorgon himself repealed the order in 1645, the demand was reinstituted when resistance resumed.[citation needed] Hundreds of thousands of people were killed before all of China was brought into compliance.

It paved the way for future innovation from artists such as Frank Ocean, The Weekend, Drake, Future, and Kid Cudi, even Kid Cudi and Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy who instead sought a thoughtful alternative to rap bombast. Reviewing West's musical career prior The Life of Pablo in Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield considered: There\u2019s a lot of 808s & Heartbreak in the mix. His emo crooner phase remains his most maligned by fans and critics \u2014 it\u2019s the bridge between the acclaimed genius of his 2000s era and his post-Yeezus villain persona. Yet once the dust settled, 808s was easily the most influential album of his career. Who needs friends when you can turn your voice into a cyborg-raccoon power tool for sad-man melodrama? In 808s, the debut formula for realness began to take over vague outlines of the emo-hop future: Kid Cudi, Drake, The Weeknd, Future, etc \u2014 or even Keef and Durk for that matter. Ben Detrick of XXL recognized West as \"a new archetype in which honest personal themes trump the minstrel posturing of gangsta rap.\" He is followed by rappers \"who don\u2019t care, or aren\u2019t smart enough to care, about rapping about gunplay or bricks.\" Detrick cited Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 88, "wordsSpent": 1211, "remainingCredits": 118235, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation \u2013 in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions. The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the University of Paris. Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna.

For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture Hegel presents is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\"", "text_ai_base": "Hegel aims to retain the truths he perceives in German idealism, particularly Kant's belief that ethical reason transcends finite inclinations.

One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe.

Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue.

Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier.

This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, those who control the means of production (the economic base) essentially control a culture.[citation needed] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them.

To advance through the strait and reach the landing zones, Nishimura had to face this gauntlet. Around 03:00, the Japanese battleship Fus\u014d and three destroyers were struck by torpedoes, causing Fus\u014d to break in two. By 03:50, U.S. battleships opened fire; their radar fire control allowed them to hit targets from much greater distances than the Japanese could. The battleship Yamashiro, along with a cruiser and a destroyer, were severely damaged by 16-inch (406 mm) shells, with Yamashiro sinking at 04:19. In the end, only one of Nishimura's seven ships escaped the confrontation. By 04:25, Shima's fleet of two cruisers and eight destroyers arrived at the battle scene.

Due to the feud between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy, and the general lack of military intelligence sharing, none of the commanders of the Japanese fleet were aware of the presence of the Sixth United States Army in and around Leyte Gulf.[50] As a result, Nishimura also failed to communicate with Shima and the two forces' arrival at Surigao Strait was not coordinated.

The Southern Force ran into trouble in the Panaon Strait between Leyte and Panaon Island, where at 02:00, they were attacked by three American PT boats in the seven-mile wide strait. Just past midnight on 25 October, Nishimura's Southern Force of battleships Yamashiro and Fus\u014d, the cruiser Mogami, and four destroyers steamed into a deadly trap. The U.S. Seventh Fleet Support Force was commanded by Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf and consisted of six battleships (USS Mississippi, West Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee, California and Pennsylvania), four heavy cruisers (USS Louisville, Portland, Minneapolis and Australian HMAS Shropshire), four light cruisers (USS Denver, Columbia, Phoenix and Boise), 29 destroyers, and 39 motor torpedo boats. To pass through the strait and reach the Allied invasion fleet, Nishimura had to run the gauntlet of seven destroyers and 27 motor torpedo boats (the other two in the 7th Fleet were no longer battleworthy[a]) before entering the arcs of fire of six battleships and eight cruisers on the other side. At 03:00, Fus\u014d, with three destroyers, was hit by torpedoes launched by PT boats. By 03:50, Fuso had sunk, followed at 04:10 by three destroyers sunk in the same manner.[citation needed] At 03:50, Yamashiro, a cruiser, and a destroyer were hobbled by gunfire from six battleships all 16 in (406 mm) guns, out-ranging the Japanese battleships by a wide margin, due to the advanced (for its time) naval radar in use by U.S. ships,[51] as well as gunfire from four heavy cruisers. Yamashiro later sank at 04:19.[52] Of note in this battle is the fact that the command for the U.S. battleships that fired their 16 in (406 mm) shells was the same ships' commanding officers and crew (with some replacements in the former roles of Admiral and unit commanders) who were present during and survived the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor \u2013 battleships West Virginia, California, Tennessee, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi), although only the USS Pennsylvania fired at the enemy aircraft causing little if any casualties. In this brief engagement, the Yamashiro and a destroyer were sunk, one destroyer was able to escape and the damaged cruiser returned and eventually joined Kurita's Centre Force.[53] At 04:25, Shima's two heavy cruisers and eight destroyers encountered what was left of Nishimura's force.

Notre Dame was known for many things in its early years, but football was not one of them.[49] The college first played football in November 1887 when a group of students from Michigan traveled to South Bend to teach the game to students from the university.[50] The game incorporated elements from soccer and rugby initially, and it took a few years for the rules to become standardized with those of Division I-A football that we know today.[51] The university eventually adopted the current version of the game, but before then it was still called Notre Dame Football because they were playing football at Notre Dame University.[52] Although there are several theories as to the origin of the Fighting Irish nickname, it was used as a moniker for the football team throughout most of the 1920s. The nickname became popular throughout the country because alumnus Francis Wallace wrote it in his columns in the New York Daily News.[53] It was unofficial until 1951, when then-University President Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, adopted the moniker at the request of students.[54][55][a] The official colors of the University of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush.[56] The school's athletic teams wear a combination of the two on their uniforms for competitions. Additionally, as the \"Fighting Irish\", Notre Dame also often uses green, traditionally the color of the fighting Irish or clover that is associated with Ireland. Athletics mascot The Notre Dame Leprechaun was designed by sports artist Theodore W. Drake in 1964.[57] The leprechaun logo was first featured on the football pocket schedule and later it was on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time magazine (November 1964). This is the logo most usually associated with Notre Dame sports.[58][59]", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 92, "wordsSpent": 839, "remainingCredits": 113421, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

By 1920, many branch lines had been added, making Thuringia's rail system one of the densest globally before World War II, totaling about 2,500 km of track. From 1950 to 2000, most branch lines were abandoned, halving the network compared to 1940. However, after 1990, most main lines were renovated, enhancing travel speeds. Currently, the Thuringian Railway and the Saal Railway are key routes. The Thuringian Railway links Halle and Leipzig with Frankfurt and Kassel, passing through Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha, and Eisenach, and offers hourly ICE/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt. The Saal Railway connects Halle/Leipzig to Nuremberg via Jena and Saalfeld, served by hourly ICE trains from Berlin to Munich. A new high-speed line, opening in 2017, will reroute long-distance services away from these historical lines.

Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse. A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members/directors is concerned. Beware of board-only organizations- review the board members annual income before donating, such as the Clinton Foundation.

Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry.

It succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids, up to levels previously enjoyed by the Mughals. For example, the cornerstone of the Maratha rule in Malwa rested on the 60 or so local tax collectors who advanced the Maratha ruler Peshwa a portion of their district revenues at interest.

Two U.S. destroyers and a DE were sunk, but they had bought enough time for the Taffy groups to launch planes.

After the Cantabrian Wars, which ended in 19 BC, Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire; being made into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410 the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga, now in Portugal, which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711 the Arabs and Berbers invaded and conquered the Visigothic kingdom; until Galicia, in 740, joined the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages Galicia is sometimes found having its own rulers, although most of the time it remained united to the kingdom of Leon - later annexed to the kingdom of Castille, while maintaining its own traditional legal system and culture.

A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the Tufts University Beelzebubs and the Boston University Dear Abbeys. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including vocal percussion/\"beatboxing\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as the Georgetown Chimes' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as International Quartet Champions The Boston Common and the contemporary commercial a cappella group Rockapella.

The longest continuously-operating group is probably The Rensselyrics [1] of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which was founded in 1873 as the RPI Glee Club.[citation needed] The Yale Whiffenpoofs were formed in 1909 and are arguably the best-known group, having been featured on the long-running television show The Sing-Off. Cole Porter was a member of the Whiffenpoofs, and they have retained their ties with the dominant musical theater tradition over the years. Throughout the 20th century a cappella developed a presence on numerous college campuses, with many groups once again having their roots in the traditional college glee club. The Princeton Nassoons date back to 1941, the Colgate 13 to 1942, the Dartmouth Aires to 1946, the MIT Chorallaries to 1946, the Harvard Krokodiloes to 1946, the Cornell University Cayuga's Waiters to 1949, The Madison Project of James Madison University to 1952, the University of Maine Steiners to 1957, the Yale Spizzwinks(?) to 1914, Jabberwocks of Brown University to 1949, the University of Rochester YellowJackets to 1956, and the Georgetown Chimes to 1946. Shortly after their all-male counterparts emerged in their respective schools, all-female ensembles were formed in response, often parodying the names of the original male ensembles. Examples include the Smiffenpoofs (founded in 1936 at Smith College), The Shwiffs (The \u201cShe-Whiffenpoofs\u201d) of Connecticut College (founded in 1944), and The Chattertocks of Brown University (founded in 1951). The Aires and Brovertones merged to become the Dartmouth Cords. The exponential growth of a cappella in the 1990s has been attributed to two factors: the contemporaneous emergence of groups that embraced a new style, with vocals imitating electric guitar, trumpet, bass, and even vocal percussion or \u201cbeatboxing,\u201d and the publication and access to recorded a cappella music through the website CASA.org run by the Contemporary A Cappella Society. The Tufts Beelzebubs and the Boston University Dear Abbeys (named after the advice columnists) were two of the earliest groups to integrate these new stylistic changes into their repertoires. Most collegiate groups are either all-male or all-female, although some feature both male and female singers. Many combine a light-hearted atmosphere and the styles and music of their times with more traditional and classical pieces that showcase their technical skills. There are numerous longstanding traditions, including many groups that \u201ccall-out\u201d new members when they are tapped to the group, a smaller sub-group that persists in many a cappella groups as documented by Mickey Rapkin in his book, Pitched Perfect: The Pursuit of Collegiate A Cappella Glory.[2] There are several recognized historical categories for collegiate a cappella groups, including Christian (such as Carolina Harmony, the oldest Christian group in existence), Jewish, fraternity and sorority (Sweetheart Singers, Hearttohearts, and Acafellas), barbershop (such as Ball in the House), and international (Caius College Cambridge and the Oxford Alternotives). Most of these groups are not collegiate in nature and are more likely to be identified as part of the broader a cappella scene and movement. Many are semi-professional and tour extensively, often performing at private gigs in concert halls and at large a cappella festivals. The Georgetown Chimes, for example, have hosted an annual Cherry Tree Massacre concert for over 100 collegiate a cappella groups over three weekends in February since 1975, with notable performances by International Quartet Champions The Boston Common and commercial a cappella group Rockapella.[3][4] Mainstream pop and rock groups associated with collegiate a cappella include The Whiffenpoofs, the Tufts Beelzebubs, the Yale Spizzwinks(?), the University of Virginia Gentlemen of the College, the Penn University Counterparts, the Harvard Veritones, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers, the Yale Redhot & Blue, the Bowdoin Longfellows, the Tufts University Amalgamates, the Tufts University Turkeys, the Columbia Kingston Kingsmen, the Phillips Academy Brovertones, and the Dartmouth Aires.[citation needed] There are records of notable co-ed groups as well, such as the University of Pennsylvania Cup of Cold Water (founded in 1972 by Mac Silver, Jamie Borja, and Lynne Cohen), the Dartmouth Cords (a co-ed group founded in 1977), and the Harvard Veritones (a co-ed group founded in 1985). Many a cappella groups are associated with notable musicians, including John Legend,[5] Dr. Ramani,[6] Ren\u00e9e Fleming,[7] and many others. For example, Mira Sorvino (an accomplished actress) was a member of the Harvard Veritones and performed a plaintive solo on \"Only You\" by Yaz.[8] Sara Bareilles, the popular recording artist with a hit 2007 song \u201cLove Song,\u201d started in the UCLA-based co-ed group Awaken A Cappella.[9]", "humanizer_model": "stealthgpt_low", "humanization_status": "ok", "humanizer_was_truncated": false, "humanizer_metadata": {"api_response": {"result": "The history of modern collegiate a cappella is murky, but organized a cappella groups have been around for over a century. The longest continuously-operating group is probably The Rensselyrics [1] of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which was founded in 1873 as the RPI Glee Club.[citation needed] The Yale Whiffenpoofs were formed in 1909 and are arguably the best-known group, having been featured on the long-running television show The Sing-Off. Cole Porter was a member of the Whiffenpoofs, and they have retained their ties with the dominant musical theater tradition over the years. Throughout the 20th century a cappella developed a presence on numerous college campuses, with many groups once again having their roots in the traditional college glee club. The Princeton Nassoons date back to 1941, the Colgate 13 to 1942, the Dartmouth Aires to 1946, the MIT Chorallaries to 1946, the Harvard Krokodiloes to 1946, the Cornell University Cayuga's Waiters to 1949, The Madison Project of James Madison University to 1952, the University of Maine Steiners to 1957, the Yale Spizzwinks(?) to 1914, Jabberwocks of Brown University to 1949, the University of Rochester YellowJackets to 1956, and the Georgetown Chimes to 1946. Shortly after their all-male counterparts emerged in their respective schools, all-female ensembles were formed in response, often parodying the names of the original male ensembles. Examples include the Smiffenpoofs (founded in 1936 at Smith College), The Shwiffs (The \u201cShe-Whiffenpoofs\u201d) of Connecticut College (founded in 1944), and The Chattertocks of Brown University (founded in 1951). The Aires and Brovertones merged to become the Dartmouth Cords. The exponential growth of a cappella in the 1990s has been attributed to two factors: the contemporaneous emergence of groups that embraced a new style, with vocals imitating electric guitar, trumpet, bass, and even vocal percussion or \u201cbeatboxing,\u201d and the publication and access to recorded a cappella music through the website CASA.org run by the Contemporary A Cappella Society. The Tufts Beelzebubs and the Boston University Dear Abbeys (named after the advice columnists) were two of the earliest groups to integrate these new stylistic changes into their repertoires. Most collegiate groups are either all-male or all-female, although some feature both male and female singers. Many combine a light-hearted atmosphere and the styles and music of their times with more traditional and classical pieces that showcase their technical skills. There are numerous longstanding traditions, including many groups that \u201ccall-out\u201d new members when they are tapped to the group, a smaller sub-group that persists in many a cappella groups as documented by Mickey Rapkin in his book, Pitched Perfect: The Pursuit of Collegiate A Cappella Glory.[2] There are several recognized historical categories for collegiate a cappella groups, including Christian (such as Carolina Harmony, the oldest Christian group in existence), Jewish, fraternity and sorority (Sweetheart Singers, Hearttohearts, and Acafellas), barbershop (such as Ball in the House), and international (Caius College Cambridge and the Oxford Alternotives).

Like Frontier, Savers has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\"Digital Accident Tactics Squad\"), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad requires the human partner's DNA (\"Digital Natural Ability\" in the English version and \"Digisoul\" in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon's attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver are not edited and used in the English dub.

Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on.

Moreover, \u0130nalc\u0131k writes that even philosophy was studied in order to prove the thesis of Islam. Thus, madaris were originally the religious centers to educate Islamic knowledge in the early modern Ottoman Empire. Even though many historians, such as Charles E. Goffman , would argue that the Ottomans were very tolerant and lived under a diverse society, it was the case that these schools were founded to educate Ottoman children in Islam but not in other religions. However, this was almost identical to what occurred in Europe. Jewish children were taught to pray in Hebrew at their homes and Torah at the schools run by the synagogues.

Biographies of Lee, analyses of the novel, and materials created for the classroom explore many of the lessons that can be taught with the novel, its influence on the movement, and the connection of the Civil Rights Movement to the story; e.g., as in \"Critical Insights: To Kill a Mockingbird\" (2010) and \"Scout, Atticus & Boo: A Celebration of Fifty Years of To Kill a Mockingbird\" (2010), which provide extensive commentary and analyses focusing on the book's messages and how they are conveyed. In addition, many authors and readers have commented that the book gives true, memorable, and noteworthy examples and representations to the personal, political, and social issues at play at the time in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young states the book's message is, for many, \"the inspiration that pulled us all together. This is history as we need to understand it in America: an inspiration to think differently about everything that went on and continues to go on in the world. The book and its history are understandably an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the racial injustice of this country.\" Young said that the book brings out the \"best exemplars of the old South,\" and it represents \"not that the Jim Crow system worked for black people but the people best worked it.\" He also states that the book can teach \"hope\" to civil rights groups and others of system changes centered on communities \"not by chaotic and kicking-in-the-door activities, but by the subject matter of education in self-discipline.\" He highlights that the book \"inspires hope out of the madness and confusion\" and its racial slurs are not offensive in the context of the book but rather utilized to loosely represent the era in which the book is set. Young states the novel is \"an act of humanity\" in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama-born author Mark Childress said, \"To Kill a Mockingbird gives white Southerners a way to understand our history and our racism. It is a novel that is so deeply influential that a prominent librarian recently said 'the book is our conscience; the movie was our black-and-white Bible.' Our Bible as a metaphor seems suitable because, like the Good Book, the story told in Harper Lee\u2019s classic novel changed the world. Nobody could argue with the dark inspiration of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, which is widely believed by historians to have ignited the U.S. Civil War. But To Kill a Mockingbird was about white people. Many whites in the South were good people; they didn\u2019t riot or tweet or dynamite churches. The novel showed them where the holes were in their own system in a way that thousands of treatises and tracts couldn\u2019t do, because it was popular art in which they were the children, not the adults.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 85, "wordsSpent": 892, "remainingCredits": 92482, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Low", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}
