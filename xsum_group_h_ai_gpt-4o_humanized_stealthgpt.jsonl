{"id": "xsum_12391532", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "So what is the levy? What's really at stake? And why raise the rate now? What is the bank levy? It is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that: Originally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May. The standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January. What's it for? The government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous. The tax will also raise a lot of money for the government. So will this help deal with the budget deficit? The Treasury hopes the tax will bring in \u00a32.6bn every year. That's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year. It's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five. What's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage? Traditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies. But during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets. Unlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again. A lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days. When the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts. This caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend. Unable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure. Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy? Bank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock. But since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs.", "text_ai_base": "What is the levy, what is at stake, and why is the rate being increased now? The bank levy is an annual tax on the debt value of UK banks, including deposited funds, with exceptions. Initially, the Treasury planned a lower rate of 0.05% for 2011, but in February, it opted for a standard rate of 0.075% starting in May. The rate was slightly raised to 0.078% in March and will increase again to 0.088% from January. The purpose of the levy is twofold: the government aims to deter banks from depending on risky borrowing methods, which contributed to worsening the 2008 crisis, and to generate substantial revenue. Can it help address the budget deficit? The Treasury estimates the levy will generate \u00a32.6 billion annually, which amounts to 2.1% of the forecast budget deficit by the Office for Budget Responsibility this year. It represents roughly 19% of the pre-tax profits reported by the five major UK banks in the 12 months leading to September, though the tax applies to more banks than just these five. What about the borrowing the government wishes to discourage? Traditionally, banks lend out money from the deposits made by individuals and businesses. However, over the last decade, banks have adopted new, complex methods to borrow trillions from global markets. Unlike regular deposits, there is no natural cap on this money since it can originate globally and circulate repeatedly among banks. A substantial portion of these debts was short-term, requiring banks to return to the markets for refinancing every few days. During the financial crisis, investors feared banks might default on their debts, triggering a market panic where investors stopped lending. This inability to refinance threatened even profitable banks with collapse. Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy? Bank runs typically conjure images of long queues of depositors withdrawing funds\u2014as seen with Northern Rock.

With a slight tweak, the rate is now 0.078%. And now the rate has been raised again to 0.088% from January. The prime purpose of the tax is to punish banks for relying on risky methods of borrowing that worsened the 2008 crisis, but it's also a cash cow for the government.

It also allegedly spied on European firms. Among individuals targeted was German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

US states take aim at NSA facilities The latest verdict, by the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, came after New York District Judge William Pauley had dismissed a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which argued that the way the NSA tracked million of calls contravened the US constitution. The 97-page ruling says that \"a provision of the USA Patriot Act permitting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect business records deemed relevant to a counterterrorism investigation cannot be legitimately interpreted to permit the systematic bulk collection of domestic calling records\".

Lethal yellowing, the same condition that devastated the iconic trees in Florida and Jamaica, also strikes at the heart of this 280sq km (108sq mile) island's culture and economy. Here, coconut products are used in everything from food and drink to beauty treatments and traditional medicine. Around 45% of Antigua's thousands of coconut palms have been lost to date, estimates Barbara Japal, president of the island's Horticultural Society. Street vendor Julian Rose is one of those affected. He has been selling coconut water for $3.70 (\u00c2\u00a32.40) a bottle for four years, but says the last 12 months have seen supplies nosedive by half - as has his income. \"I've kept my prices the same - people won't pay more,\" he says. The official advice states that palms showing signs of the contagious disease, characterised by premature shedding of fruit and yellowing fronds that eventually drop off, should immediately be cut down and burned to prevent the disease spreading. But the cash-strapped government's lack of resources has enabled it to run rampant, with the trees dying in droves since lethal yellowing was first identified in 2012. \"It affects tourism because, as we say, the 'palm is the charm' and it really diminishes what the seascape looks like,\" Mrs Japal tells the BBC. \"It's devastating to see them standing there looking like beheaded soldiers. It's shocking, it feels irreverent. \"Coconuts are used in so many aspects of daily life here too; people cook with them, put the oil on their skin and hair. And while it may not be part of conventional medicine, it's part of our tradition to use the oil to heal the skin and cleanse the body.\" Lethal yellowing is spread by a plant-hopping insect that Mrs Japal believes was probably brought into the country with imported trees. A ban on importing palms has been in place since 2012. \"We had so many plants brought in some years ago,\" Mrs Japal continues. \"We have a plant protection unit but when you have a container with 3,000 trees, who's going to inspect every one?\" She says underfunding had left staff's hands tied. \"There's no proper disposal or systematic removal of affected palms unless private individuals take action.\" There is currently no cure for lethal yellowing, although trees can be treated with quarterly injections of the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC). \"Local people are not using OTC; it's just too expensive,\" Mrs Japal adds.", "text_ai_base": "In tourism-reliant Antigua, a devastating disease has wiped out nearly half of the island's stately coconut palms, leaving the landscape littered with unsightly, headless trunks. Lethal yellowing, the same disease that ravaged coconut trees in Florida and Jamaica, poses a serious threat to both the culture and economy of this 280 square kilometer (108 square mile) island. Coconut products are integral to local cuisine, beauty treatments, and traditional medicine. Barbara Japal, president of the island's Horticultural Society, estimates that about 45% of Antigua's coconut palms have been lost. Street vendor Julian Rose is among those affected, having sold coconut water for $3.70 (\u00a32.40) a bottle for four years. Over the past year, his supply\u2014and consequently his income\u2014have been cut in half. \"I've kept my prices the same\u2014people won't pay more,\" he explains. The official guidance is to immediately cut down and burn any palm showing signs of the disease, which include premature fruit shedding and yellowing fronds that eventually fall off. Unfortunately, the government's limited resources have allowed the disease to spread unchecked since it was first identified in 2012. \"It affects tourism because, as we say, the 'palm is the charm,' and it really diminishes the seascape,\" Mrs. Japal tells the BBC. \"Seeing them stand like beheaded soldiers is devastating. It\u2019s shocking and feels irreverent. Coconuts play a huge role in everyday life here: people use them for cooking, and the oil is applied to skin and hair. While it may not be mainstream medicine, the oil is part of our tradition for healing skin and cleansing the body.\" Lethal yellowing spreads via a plant-hopping insect, which Mrs. Japal suspects arrived with imported trees. Since 2012, there has been a ban on importing palms. \"We had numerous plants brought in years ago,\" Mrs. Japal continues. \"We have a plant protection unit, but who inspects every container of 3,000 trees?\" She notes that underfunding has left the staff powerless. \"Affected palms aren't properly disposed of or systematically removed unless private individuals intervene.\" While there is no cure for lethal yellowing, trees can be treated with quarterly injections of the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC). \"Local people don't use OTC; it's just too expensive,\" Mrs. Japal adds.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "*In tourism\u2011reliant Antigua a terrible sickness killed almost half the island\u2019s lofty coconut trees, so now the scenery is dotted with ugly, head\u2011less trunks.* Lethal yellow, the same disease that wiped out coconut trees in Florida and Jamaica, it\u2019s now a threat to this 280\u2011sq\u2011km island\u2019s culture and its economy.

It certainly took the commodities markets (and me) rather by surprise when it agreed to cut production at a meeting in Algiers. In fact the group has a lot of work to do before it has a real and sustained impact on the price. But that decision was not what the market expected. Traders thought the result would be more disarray, as there was at a meeting of Opec and some other oil exporters in Doha back in April. This time they did manage to make progress. The context for the Algiers decision - and the unsuccessful attempts to agree action before - is crude oil prices are less than half what they were in June 2014. That hurts Opec member countries. Government finances and economic performance have taken a substantial hit. In Saudi Arabia for example, the government's finances were in surplus to the tune of 12% of annual income (GDP) in 2012. Last year there was a deficit of 16%. Angola's economy grew 7% in 2013. Last year it was 3%. Venezuela's figures are much worse, though it's far from being entirely due to the lower price of oil. That has however severely aggravated the economic damage done by the country's political crisis. Opec member countries have felt this financial pain with increasing intensity for almost two years now. Opec doesn't account for the whole market by a long way. There are very large oil producers that are not members, notably the United States, Russia, China and Canada. But the group, which currently has about 40% of the global market can move it by cutting production - and it does have a history of responding to low oil prices, by cutting production. In the past Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest player, has often led the effort. This time the situation was complicated by Iran's emergence earlier this year from international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Tehran was determined to take advantage and sought to recover its share of the market. For Opec, the trouble was that Saudi Arabia was unwilling to curb production without Iran doing likewise, a position also underpinned by the longstanding geopolitical tension between the two countries which are the leading powers in the Gulf. That tension was the reason for the failure in Doha in April. Things seem to have changed. Iran has boosted oil production already. It could go higher, but not as easily as was the case in the immediate aftermath of the lifting of sanctions. Saudi Arabia has softened its position.", "text_ai_base": "Perhaps it was indeed unexpected. The commodities markets\u2014and I myself\u2014were taken by surprise when OPEC decided to cut production at their meeting in Algiers. The group still faces challenges in achieving a meaningful and lasting impact on prices. However, the decision was not anticipated by the market. Traders had expected more disarray, similar to the meeting in Doha last April, involving OPEC and other oil exporters. This time, though, progress was made. The backdrop to Algiers\u2014and previous unsuccessful agreement attempts\u2014is the substantial drop in crude oil prices, now less than half what they were in June 2014. This decline has heavily impacted OPEC countries' finances and economic performance. For instance, Saudi Arabia's government had a surplus amounting to 12% of GDP in 2012, compared to a 16% deficit last year. Angola's economy grew by 7% in 2013, but last year it was only 3%. Venezuela's situation is even worse, though the country's issues extend beyond oil prices, compounded by a political crisis. For nearly two years, OPEC countries have experienced increasing financial strain. Although OPEC doesn't encompass the entire market\u2014countries like the United States, Russia, China, and Canada are significant non-member producers\u2014the group controls about 40% of the global market. Historically, it has influenced prices by cutting production in response to low prices. Saudi Arabia, the largest player in the group, has often led these efforts. This year, the situation was complicated by Iran's emergence from international sanctions related to its nuclear program, with Tehran eager to regain market share. The problem for OPEC was Saudi Arabia's reluctance to reduce production unless Iran did the same, a stance supported by longstanding geopolitical tensions between the two Gulf powerhouses. This tension was the reason for Doha's failure in April. However, circumstances have shifted. Iran has already boosted oil production and may increase it further, but not as easily as after sanctions were lifted.

The coalition government reduced the highest income tax rate from 50% to 45% in 2013. Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, criticised Mr Osborne's refusal to rule out a further cut. Asked on Sky News's Murnaghan programme if there were plans to cut income tax by 5% for those earning over \u00a3150,000, George Osborne said \"that's not our plan\". Challenged as to whether he would explicitly rule the move out, the chancellor replied: \"You can judge us by what we say we want to do. And what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to \u00a312,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions of people are better off. \"And when it comes to higher-rate tax payers, our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate to \u00a350,000. \"Those are our big tax commitments for the coming Parliament.\" When asked later if he would cut the top rate of tax, Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"It's not our policy. It's not our plan. \"Our plan is to raise to \u00a312,500 the basic rate threshold, so that we take another million people out of income tax altogether and cut tax for 30 million people. That's the plan.\" But Ed Balls said: \"When George Osborne cut the top rate of income tax from 50p down to 45p we know that he and David Cameron wanted to go further and actually cut it to 40p - which, if they were to do that, would mean hundreds of thousands more in tax cuts for the richest people in our society.\" He added: \"They need to tell us is that their plan - they won't rule it out, they should do so now.\" This election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat minister David Laws has accused the Conservatives of \"unbelievable cheek\" in taking credit for personal tax allowance rises. Mr Laws, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, said the prime minister and chancellor had failed to push for the move in talks with Lib Dems. His party will spell out plans to \"go further and faster\" in increasing the allowance in the coming days, he said. George Osborne said raising the level was one of his \"big tax commitments\".

On Sky News's Murnaghan programme, when asked about a perceived 5% tax rate reduction for those earning over \u00a3150,000, Osborne replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not our plan.\u201d When pressed to explicitly rule out the move, the chancellor said, \u201cYou can judge us by what we say we want to do. Our goal is to increase the tax-free personal allowance to \u00a312,500, so full-time workers on minimum wage won\u2019t have to pay income tax, benefiting millions. Our priority for higher-rate taxpayers is to raise the higher rate threshold to \u00a350,000. These are our key tax commitments for the next Parliament.\u201d Later, when questioned about cutting the top rate, Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated, \u201cIt\u2019s not our policy. We plan to raise the basic rate threshold to \u00a312,500, exempting another million from income tax and reducing tax for 30 million people.\u201d Ed Balls argued, \"When George Osborne reduced the top tax rate from 50p to 45p, we knew he and Cameron intended to lower it further to 40p. If they do, it means extra tax cuts for the wealthiest.\u201d He added, \u201cThey need to clarify their intentions and rule it out now.\u201d These discussions also cover income tax, national insurance, and business taxes. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat minister David Laws accused the Conservatives of claiming undue credit for personal allowance increases.

During the evacuation of Dunkirk, he was the chief engine room artificer on board the Hebe, a minesweeper deployed to Dover as a control vessel. The Hebe crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June. \"It was torrid, dangerous and nerve-wracking with all-day long German air attacks\", says Harold Biles who marked his 28th birthday during the height of the bombardment. \"The Hebe was lying about 200 metres off the beach at Dunkirk, and there was just a seething mass of soldiers. All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us. \"There was constant bombing and shellfire. We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep.\" In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England. \"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves.

He served as the chief engine room artificer during the Dunkirk evacuation aboard the Hebe, which was stationed in Dover as a control vessel. The Hebe made three crossings to Dunkirk during the turbulent period from 27 May to 4 June. \"It was torrid, dangerous, and nerve-wracking with constant German air attacks,\" recalls Harold Biles, who turned 28 amidst the bombardment. \"The Hebe lay about 200 meters off Dunkirk's beach, surrounded by thousands of soldiers. We were on the water, they were on the beach, desperately trying to reach us. \"Bombing and shellfire were relentless. Nightfall offered some respite and a chance to rest.\" In the early hours of 29 May 1940, HMS Hebe's captain dispatched a small boat to Dunkirk's beach to retrieve Lord John Gort, commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force, and transport him to England. \"As we sped back to Dover, I recall Lord Gort standing by the guardrail, steadied against the rise and fall of waves. He was striking in his red-trimmed uniform but stood motionless, head bowed. \"There was no celebration for evacuating 330,000 men and sparing them from Nazi POW camps. To him, it was defeat.

As the league closes in on an annual revenue of \u00a316bn ($25bn), expansion plans into Europe and specifically London, continue apace. And as Goodell tops up his bank balance with a yearly income in the region of \u00a326m ($40m), the professional game of American Football is more popular and yet, some would argue, more contemptible than ever. Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore's Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far-reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale: Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country. More than 17m attended the 256 regular season games, the highest figure since 2008, while television audiences hit record highs. Media playback is not supported on this device While youth participation figures are down over concerns surrounding long-term brain damage caused by concussion, NFL fans are embracing the game like never before, both within the United States and globally. The annual Harris Report, which tracks the popularity of American sports, says the NFL is still number one by a huge margin - double the popularity of Major League Baseball and College Football. A report released this week by the sports market research group Repucom also makes some interesting claims, notably that: Most of the television networks that broadcast the NFL had audiences tuning in in greater numbers than in 2013, while the figures for both Thursday and Monday Night Football were up significantly. More than 47m people watched the NFL's annual College Draft, yet not one pass was thrown or one tackle made.

Meanwhile, Commissioner Goodell earns approximately \u00a326m ($40m) a year, as American Football's professional scene grows both in popularity and controversy. In 2014, fifty NFL players were arrested for various offenses, ranging from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked illegally in a disabled space, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, charged with child abuse. Among these incidents were five cases of domestic violence, notably involving Baltimore's Ray Rice, caught on camera assaulting his fianc\u00e9e in an elevator. Goodell faced criticism over the NFL's handling of the Rice situation, which was followed by a comprehensive report led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, criticizing the league's management. The challenges have persisted into 2015, with already four new player arrests, including domestic violence and rape charges. Despite the turmoil, the NFL continues to thrive as a business. Public scandals, such as those involving Rice and Peterson, soon faded, and attendance at stadiums surged, with over 17 million fans attending the 256 regular-season games, the most since 2008. Television viewership has reached record levels as well. Though youth participation has declined due to concussion concerns, NFL fandom is stronger than ever, both domestically and internationally.

The official reason given was that he wanted to give the Thai people time to mourn his father before he became king.

Much of it is decorated with incongruous advertising pictures, black-and-white shots of men in sunglasses and designer stubble. UK Prime Minister David Cameron wants to take refugees directly from camps like this in the Middle East, rather than absorb the people who have already made the journey to Hungary, Greece or Italy. The logic is that it will stop people making the perilous voyage across the Mediterranean. It makes a lot of sense. But it may already be too little, and far too late. Taking 4,000 more people each year until 2020 will hardly dent the problem. The border with Syria is only a few miles across the hill rising above the camp. The people here can still hear the war they fled, as President Bashar al-Assad's bombs land on a besieged town. Life is definitely safer this side of the border. But it is not comfortable. There are rats, the drinking water is dirty, and while it is now stifling under the September Sun, in winter the snow is 3ft (1m) high and they freeze. More importantly, life is getting worse and the pressure to leave Lebanon is growing all the time. One man, Mzead al-Ali, tells me he is on the brink of following those who have made the perilous exodus, leaving his wife and four children, including two seven-month-old twins, behind in the camp, so he can send them money. His brother left three days ago for Turkey. They haven't heard from him since he went, and don't know if he is safe. His mother wants to talk about it but has to keep pressing her hands flat against her face, to stop the tears. This is not, according to the government here, a refugee camp but a temporary settlement, and there are thousands like it. Lebanon is a country of four million people, and it now hosts well over a million refugees from its war-riven bigger neighbour.

These makeshift walls often feature incongruous advertising images, such as black-and-white photos of men sporting sunglasses and designer stubble. UK Prime Minister David Cameron proposes to accept refugees directly from Middle Eastern camps like this, aiming to curb the dangerous Mediterranean crossings. This approach seems logical, though it might be too late and too limited. Welcoming 4,000 more people each year through 2020 is unlikely to significantly alleviate the situation. Just a few miles away, over the hills, lies the Syrian border, where residents still hear the distant bombings by President Bashar al-Assad on besieged towns. Although they find safety on this side of the border, comfort is elusive.

In 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality. An 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status\". Thousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities. As the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division. Weekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair. The church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches. Looking around the camp, one of several along Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, you might think that the parishioners have little to be thankful for. It is surely one of the poorest places in Latin America. A year ago thousands of returning Haitians arrived at Parc Cadeau. Some had been forcibly deported from the Dominican Republic, others left voluntarily to avoid confrontation with the authorities. Today hundreds of families remain on the dusty ranch, living in hastily erected shacks of plastic sheeting, cardboard and rope, trapped in near stateless limbo. Soinicier Giles is typical of many in the camp. He spent 22 years living as a farmer in the Dominican Republic, before being deported last year.

The children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself. They are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp. \"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish.

The first one to raise the alert was President Mauricio Funes himself, last April. \"We have information that they [the cartels] have entered El Salvador with exploratory purposes,\" President Funes said. Because of what he described as the \"effectiveness\" of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's policies, the cartels were looking at new bases for their operations, he added. Since then, security forces have been watching closely to see if criminal organisations like the Zetas - one of Mexico's most violent cartels - are deploying in Salvadorean territory. The cartels' possible collusion - or confrontation - with local gangs is also being monitored.

Some estimates say that about 15,000 young men and women belong to one of the gangs. In some families, a third generation of gang members is now developing. The maras have strong territorial control in some areas of the country and practice what they call \"social cleansing\" - they wipe out petty crime, but ask for money from locals in exchange for protection, and engage in widespread criminal activity. A retired gang member, who prefers not to be named, says that belonging to a \"mara\" gives young, poor Salvadoreans a sense of vindication against the larger society. \"People are scared, are afraid of what a gang member can do, like stealing or killing,\" he says. \"That is what being part of a 'mara' is about.\" The maras are not new to El Salvador, but an incident in June marked a turning point.

There are four investigations examining \"Trojan Horse\" claims that groups of hardline Muslims have been trying to take over schools in the city. A government source says that no options have been ruled in or out. The trust which runs Park View, one of the schools caught up in the claims, issued a statement on Thursday dismissing allegations of extremism as false. The education watchdog Ofsted and the Department for Education are expected to deliver reports in June on the next steps for schools which have faced these allegations. It is understood that ministers have approached heads of successful schools and academy trusts about taking over other schools where there have been concerns. This could include taking schools away from local authority control, converting them into academies - directly funded by central government - and putting them under the leadership of high-achieving head teachers. Groups of outstanding schools like the Perry Beeches chain in Birmingham may have a role. As some of the schools caught up in the Trojan Horse claims are already academies, it could mean schools being reassigned to other academy trusts. Birmingham City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on any \"proposed action\" until Ofsted's inspection reports had been published. \"We can say, however, that we are in regular contact with DfE and this action has not been discussed with us,\" said a council spokesperson. The GMB union warned: \"It is absolutely disgusting that the government is pre-empting the outcome of the investigation into these schools and planning to sell these schools on to their friends in the academy chains.\" Before the Trojan Horse claims, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had spoken publicly of his belief that the local authority might need to be broken up. Birmingham is the biggest local authority in England - and it is believed that private soundings have shown it would be difficult to find a private sector contractor willing or able to take on the running of such a wide range of services. But another option would be for some or all of the council's education and children's services to be hived off to an independent trust. This model has been used before where central government believed there was a need for radical intervention - such as in Hackney in London. Birmingham City Council's chief executive, Mark Rogers, was recorded at a meeting with school representatives last week, where he warned of a \"firestorm\" when the Ofsted reports were published, and telling his audience to prepare for \"significant structural changes\" within the education department.", "text_ai_base": "Some schools may be moved from council control and converted into academies due to the \"Trojan Horse\" investigations regarding claims that hardline Muslim groups are attempting to take over schools in the city. There are four ongoing investigations into these allegations. A government source stated that all options are still on the table. Park View, a school implicated in the claims, released a statement on Thursday denying accusations of extremism. The education watchdog Ofsted and the Department for Education are set to present reports in June outlining the next steps for schools facing these accusations. It is reported that ministers have engaged with successful schools and academy trusts about assuming control of schools with concerns, possibly transitioning them from local authority control into central government-funded academies led by accomplished headteachers. Outstanding school groups like the Perry Beeches chain in Birmingham might play a part. Since some accused schools are already academies, they may be reassigned to different academy trusts. Birmingham City Council stated it would withhold comments on any proposed actions until Ofsted's inspection reports are released. \"However, we can confirm that we maintain regular contact with the DfE, and this matter has not been discussed with us,\" a council spokesperson noted. The GMB union expressed outrage, stating: \"It is disgusting that the government is anticipating the investigation\u2019s results and planning to hand these schools to their associates in academy chains.\" Prior to the Trojan Horse claims, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw publicly suggested that the local authority might need restructuring. Birmingham is the largest local authority in England, and private consultations have suggested it would be challenging to find a private contractor capable of managing its extensive range of services. Alternatively, some or all of the council's education and children's services could be transferred to an independent trust, a model used before in Hackney, London, where central government had deemed radical intervention necessary.

Two researchers demonstrated the weaknesses by changing a flight booking and seat assignment for a reporter. The security investigators presented their findings at the Chaos Communications Congress in Germany. In a blog detailing their work Karsten Nohl and Nemanja Nikodijevic of Security Research Labs (SRL) said the computer systems behind the airlines' travel bookings system dated from the 1970s and 1980s. Though these have been updated with web services they lack security systems that would prevent abuse, they said. In particular, they added, the systems have no way to check, or authenticate, who is querying the system for flight details. Few of the reservation checking systems limit how many attempts can be made to query details. These flaws can be exploited, said the pair, because the codes used to identify travellers and their itineraries use a restricted character set. This makes it possible to bombard servers with queries to find out a person's details. \"Given only passengers' last names, their bookings codes can be found over the internet with little effort,\" they wrote. This access would let attackers steal personal information, divert frequent flyer benefits or use the data to lend credibility to phishing attacks. In some cases, said Mr Nohl, getting at a booking would let an attacker completely change flight details potentially letting them travel for free.

Airlines and travel agents should move quickly to protect traveller data, urged the two researchers.

Asmal, his family\u2019s statement says, was a \u201cloving, kind, caring and affable teenager\u201d who never showed any signs of \u201cviolence, extremist views or radicalisation\u201d. However, aged 17 and \u201cwholly unprepared for the rigours of life\u201d, he \u201cturned to the internet and social media\u201d and was \u201cexploited and brainwashed\u201d by unknown individuals whom \u201ctargeted and befriended [him] and engaged in a process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him\u201d. They continue: \u201cTalha was ordered to his death by so-called Isis handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work. \u201cWe are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us.\u201d A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: \u201cWe are aware of media reports with regard to the death of a British National in Iraq. \u201cThe identity of the individual has not been confirmed and we are unable to comment further at this time.\u201d Asmal had gone to Syria with another teenager from Dewsbury, Hassan Munshi. Munshi\u2019s brother Hammaad was 16 when he was arrested in 2006 after police found a guide to making napalm on his computer, prompting what Scotland Yard said was the most significant counter-terrorism raid since the 7 July bombings. He became the then youngest person to be convicted of charges under the Terrorism Act. British police said earlier this year that they believed at least 700 people had travelled to support or fight for jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq.

But what it also has is hundreds of students from the UK - and the number is rising. This is the university application season for UK students - and open day visits now include trips to Dutch universities, which are pitching themselves as if they were offshore Russell Group institutions. Since tuition fees rose to \u00a39,000 in England there have been repeated forecasts that students would head for cheaper European universities. Now it seems to be actually happening. Across the Netherlands, there are 2,600 UK students in universities this term - up by a third in a year. And independent school head teachers want Dutch universities to be included in the Ucas application form. The University of Groningen is a microcosm of this - up by 33% to around 300 UK students, for whom it has had to put on special open days. This 400 year-old university, second oldest in the Netherlands and in the top 100 of international rankings, now designates itself as an English-speaking institution. It is running more degree courses taught in English than in Dutch, with students from Germany, China, the UK and the Netherlands itself, all learning in English. For families from England attending the open day in Groningen, the question of tuition fees is never far from the surface. Phoebe Watkinson and her father Phil had travelled from Wirral. Phoebe said that as well as being less expensive, going to a European university would give her an \"edge\" in the jobs market. \"It shows a certain quality, it shows bravery to go to another country and it's not that far from home,\" she said. The distance does not seem daunting, she says, as it is as quick to get home from the Netherlands as from some other parts of the UK. Her father says he is from a generation when higher education was free - and he finds it \"difficult to fathom\" the level of debt being piled up. \"I would be extremely pleased if she came here,\" said Mr Watkinson. He says it would benefit her academically and socially as well as financially. \"If you ask most people what their primary driver was for looking at foreign universities, probably most of them would say straight off 'lower fees',\" he says. \"But I think there's a lot more to it than that.", "text_ai_base": "If any graffiti is spotted, it will likely be in perfectly punctuated English.

After the hike in English tuition fees to \u00a39,000, there were predictions that students would seek more affordable options overseas, and this trend appears to be unfolding. This term, 2,600 UK students are enrolled in Dutch universities, marking a 33% increase in a year.

She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. \"Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,\" he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: \"One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?\" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some \"age-memory\" might be transferred into the next generation. \"That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,\" says Prof Sinclair. \"A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.\" The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down.", "text_ai_base": "Veterinary surgeon Dr. Sandra Corr carries out a thorough physical examination on Daisy the sheep, checking for heat, swelling, crepitus, or lameness\u2014signs that might suggest disease or osteoarthritis.

Each of the 13 sheep undergoes the same rigorous tests, which they appear accustomed to enduring. Though not eager, they tolerate the joint manipulations with a resigned patience. Their calmness may stem from being some of the most closely monitored animals worldwide. Prof. Sinclair mentions the broader implications of the research, stating, \"The future of cloning science might depend on these results. A crucial question following Dolly\u2019s creation is: do these animals age normally, and how healthy are they?\" This inquiry centers on a fundamental concern with the cloning process\u2014because DNA is extracted from adult animal cells that have undergone multiple divisions, some \"age-memory\" could affect the next generation. \"This could imply that the clone might be biologically older than it appears,\" Sinclair notes. \"A newborn clone might look like a lamb but could suffer from age-related diseases prematurely.\" Dolly herself died relatively young for a sheep, at six-and-a-half years.

It is a collaboration with the National Galleries in London and Dublin. Edinburgh is the last stop for the works inspired by the man known as the \"bad boy\" of early 17th Century art. This is the first exhibition of works by Caravaggio and his followers ever to be shown in Scotland. Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was just 39 when he died in 1610. Four years earlier he had murdered a man after a quarrel over a game of tennis and spent the rest of his life as a fugitive. Christopher Baker, the acting director of the Scottish National Gallery, told BBC Scotland that Caravaggio was a \"revolutionary artist\". He said: \"You could see him as the archetypal bad boy artist who in his private life has a tempestuous time, who behaves appallingly, who is often in the courts and who is on the run having committed murder. \"In addition to all of that he is a great creative force. \"He produces these extraordinary pictures, which unsurprisingly, had an extraordinary impact and inspired other painters, who travelled to Rome and Naples from right across Europe and thought 'I need to do that, I want a piece of that as well'. \"That is the story this exhibition tells.\" One of the paintings in the exhibition, The Taking of Christ (1602), is from the National Gallery of Ireland, where it is on indefinite loan from the Jesuit Community in Dublin. It was rediscovered in 1990 in a Jesuits' residence in the Irish capital. Aidan Weston-Lewis, the curator of exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery, said it was \"frustrating\" to think that it was offered to the Scottish National Gallery for free in 1921 and turned down. He said it was the only painting by Caravaggio that has ever been in a Scottish private collection. It was bought by Scottish country gentleman William Hamilton Nisbet in Rome in 1802, directly from the Mattei family who had commissioned it 200 years earlier. The painting was on display at Biel House in East Lothian for 120 years. Mr Weston-Lewis said: \"His descendants bequeathed a large group of pictures from that collection to the Scottish National Gallery. \"We didn't have space for them all. \"They were paraded in front of the trustees at the next board meeting and some were selected and some weren't. \"Very sadly from our point of view this painting got away.", "text_ai_base": "The Beyond Caravaggio exhibition showcases works by the Italian artist and 30 other European artists influenced by him.

NHS England said consultation lengths were up to doctors and there were no national limits suggesting 10 minutes. However, the NHS Choices website does state that \"GPs spend an average of 8-10 minutes with each patient\" and advises patients to \"plan ahead to make sure you cover everything you want to discuss\". The BMA, which published a report on \"safe working in general practice\" earlier this month, called for a reorganisation and warned that GPs faced \"unsustainable pressure\" from increasing workload and staff shortages. The report said it was intended to \"stimulate discussion\" and put forward a model that could be used across the UK. Dr Nicola Hulme, a GP in Cheshire, said she found NHS England's comment about there being no national limit on appointment times \"insulting\". \"With the high levels of demand, we have to run 10-minute appointments,\" she said. \"To offer longer with the same number of appointments would extend our day to beyond the 12 hours we currently routinely work. \"I often run late so I can deal thoroughly with my patients' issues. \"Paperwork gets started routinely after 7pm.

Aged 70, the man who defeated Hillary Clinton at Tuesday's polls is one of America's most famous and colourful billionaires, with a net worth of $3.7bn (\u00c2\u00a32.9bn; \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.4bn), according to Forbes business magazine. Berlusconi, 80, served four terms as prime minister before his criminal convictions in 2013 and 2015. Forbes values him and his family at $5.9bn. Asked what they had in common, Berlusconi told Italian daily Corriere della Sera (in Italian): \"There are some obvious similarities even though my story as an entrepreneur is very different to Trump's, whom I've never met.\" The Italian politician did not go into detail but similarities he may have had in mind include: The combover: A hairstyle that refuses to lie down Berlusconi bandana hides mystery Berlusconi and the bunga bunga What are the allegations against Trump?

In the interview, Berlusconi stopped short of welcoming Mr Trump's victory but the centre-right politician explained why he thought Mrs Clinton had been defeated. Mr Trump, he argued, \"was elected by all Americans weary of an old political order\". This group had, he suggested, made a \"mistake typical of all the left around the world\" in \"thinking that \"'political correctness' was the way to keep close to people's needs\". A constitutional reform referendum due to be held in Italy on 4 December is being seen as a vote of confidence in the country's current Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi. He has threatened to resign if he loses the vote. Opinion polls suggest he risks a narrow defeat and that would boost Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Five Star's founder, ex-comic Beppe Grillo, has described Mr Trump's election victory as \"the apocalypse for information, TV, the big newspapers, the intellectuals, the journalists\". Will Trump-style revolt engulf Europe?", "text_ai_base": "Berlusconi commented to an Italian newspaper that Americans have chosen Mr. Trump, urging, \"now let him go to work.\" Both Berlusconi, a media mogul, and Trump, a real estate tycoon, transitioned from business to politics. Although legal troubles have surrounded Mr. Trump, unlike Berlusconi, he has not faced criminal convictions. At 70, the man who triumphed over Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's election is one of America's most recognized and vibrant billionaires, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $3.7 billion (\u20ac3.4 billion, \u00a32.9 billion). Berlusconi, at 80, served four terms as Italy's prime minister before criminal convictions in 2013 and 2015. Forbes values him and his family at $5.9 billion. When asked about their similarities, Berlusconi told Corriere della Sera that despite some clear parallels, his entrepreneurial journey greatly differs from Trump's, whom he has never met. He didn't elaborate but may have referred to their distinctive hairstyles or controversial personas. Italians have quickly noted resemblances between the new U.S. president and their former prime minister, even dubbing them \"Trumpusconi\" on social media. In the interview, Berlusconi refrained from outright celebrating Trump's win but explained why he believed Clinton lost. Trump, he argued, \"was chosen by Americans tired of the old political order,\" indicating a mistake common among left-leaning groups globally: confusing \"political correctness\" with addressing people's actual needs. Italy faces a constitutional reform referendum on December 4, viewed as a verdict on current Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's leadership. He has vowed to resign if defeated, a prospect polls suggest is narrowly possible, which could empower Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Its founder, ex-comedian Beppe Grillo, labeled Trump's election a turning point for media and intellectual elites.

{"id": "xsum_19570024", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "Hearing partially improved when nerves in the ear, which pass sounds into the brain, were rebuilt in gerbils - a UK study in the journal Nature reports. Getting the same improvement in people would be a shift from being unable to hear traffic to hearing a conversation. However, treating humans is still a distant prospect. If you want to listen to the radio or have a chat with a friend your ear has to convert sound waves in the air into electrical signals which the brain will understand. This happens deep inside the inner ear where vibrations move tiny hairs and this movement creates an electrical signal. However, in about one in 10 people with profound hearing loss, nerve cells which should pick up the signal are damaged. It is like dropping the baton after the first leg of a relay race. The aim of researchers at the University of Sheffield was to replace those baton-dropping nerve cells, called spiral ganglion neurons, with new ones. While there is excitement at the prospect of using stem cells to restore nerves in the ear this exact technique will not help the vast, vast majority of people with hearing loss. Most hearing problems are caused by damage to the tiny delicate hairs which convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. This research group have also converted embryonic stem cells into the early versions of the hair cells. However, injecting them into the ear to restore hearing will be no easy task. The hairs cells all need to be in the exact place and pointing in exactly the right direction. Prof Dave Moore said using stem cells to repair the hairs was \"almost an impossible task\" and that the far-fetched concept of growing and transplanting a replacement ear seemed more likely. They used stem cells from a human embryo, which are capable of becoming any other type of cell in the human body from nerve to skin, muscle to kidney. A chemical soup was added to the stem cells that converted them into cells similar to the spiral ganglion neurons. These were then delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils. Over 10 weeks the gerbils' hearing improved. On average 45% of their hearing range was restored by the end of the study. Dr Marcelo Rivolta said: \"It would mean going from being so deaf that you wouldn't be able to hear a lorry or truck in the street to the point where you would be able to hear a conversation.", "text_ai_base": "A UK study, published in the journal Nature, reports that hearing partially improved in gerbils when the nerves responsible for transmitting sound to the brain were rebuilt. Although achieving similar results in humans could dramatically enhance hearing\u2014from not being able to hear traffic to understanding conversations\u2014such a treatment remains a distant possibility. To engage in activities like listening to the radio or chatting with a friend, the ear must convert sound waves from the air into electrical signals the brain can interpret. This conversion occurs deep within the inner ear, where tiny hairs generate an electrical signal from vibrations. However, around 10% of individuals with profound hearing loss have damaged nerve cells, hindering signal transmission, much like a relay baton dropped after the first leg. Researchers at the University of Sheffield aimed to replace these relay-dropped nerve cells, known as spiral ganglion neurons, with new ones. There is much excitement about using stem cells to restore ear nerves, yet this technique won't benefit the majority of those with hearing loss. Most cases arise from damage to the delicate hairs converting mechanical vibrations to electrical signals. The research group has also transformed embryonic stem cells into preliminary forms of these hair cells. However, injecting them into the ear to restore hearing remains challenging, as the hair cells must be precisely placed and oriented. Prof Dave Moore remarked that repairing the hair cells with stem cells is \"almost an impossible task,\" suggesting it is more plausible to grow and transplant a new ear. The team used stem cells from a human embryo, capable of developing into any cell type, from nerves to skin, muscle to kidney. A chemical mixture converted these stem cells into ones resembling spiral ganglion neurons, which were then carefully injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils. After ten weeks, the gerbils exhibited an average 45% restoration of their hearing range. Dr. Marcelo Rivolta explained: \"This would mean transitioning from profound deafness, where even the sound of a truck on the street is inaudible, to the ability to hear a conversation.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "UK researchers, writing in the journal Nature, were able to restore partial hearing to gerbils by using human embryonic stem cells to rebuild the nerves which transmit sounds to the brain. Experts said that, if the technique were shown to work in people, it could greatly improve some people's hearing. However, it is a big challenge which will not be possible for years. To hear the world around them, people rely on hair cells in the inner ear to turn vibrations into an electrical signal which can be interpreted by the brain. However, in up to one in 10 people with profound hearing loss the hair cells are fine so the issue lies in the nerves which actually transmit the signal to the brain, a bit like starting a race and then dropping the baton after the opening leg. The team at the University of Sheffield reasoned that they could 'implant' new nerves to complete the race in these cases. The nerves in question are called spiral ganglion neurons. Previous studies have shown some restoration of hearing using stem cells, but they had used a different source of cells which would be unsuitable for treating people. Stem cells hold promise in many different fields of medicine. They can transform into any other type of tissue in the body, from nerve to muscle, to liver, to skin. On the nerves, there has been a lot of excitement in getting stem cells to reconnect the ear to the brain. However, this technology will not help the majority of people with hearing loss. Most cases are caused by damage to the delicate hairs that are used to convert the mechanical vibrations to an electrical signal. The team has also been able to turn embryonic stem cells into very early versions of these hairs, however, how to get the hair cells inside the inner ear and restore hearing is still a challenge. They need to face the right direction and be positioned in exactly the right spot. \"It is almost an impossible task,\" said Prof Dave Moore from the Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research. \"It is probably easier to make a whole new ear and put a new one in there.\" The scientists used stem cells taken from a human embryo. They can turn into any other type of cell. They were, using a carefully orchestrated mix of chemicals, turned into cells that were very similar to to the spiral ganglion neurons, and they were delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils.

Experts said that, if the technique were shown to work in people, it could greatly improve some people's hearing. However, it is a big challenge which will not be possible for years. To hear the world around them, people rely on hair cells in the inner ear to turn vibrations into an electrical signal which can be interpreted by the brain. However, in up to one in 10 people with profound hearing loss the hair cells are fine so the issue lies in the nerves which actually transmit the signal to the brain, a bit like starting a race and then dropping the baton after the opening leg. The team at the University of Sheffield reasoned that they could 'implant' new nerves to complete the race in these cases. The nerves in question are called spiral ganglion neurons. Previous studies have shown some restoration of hearing using stem cells, but they had used a different source of cells which would be unsuitable for treating people. Stem cells hold promise in many different fields of medicine. They can transform into any other type of tissue in the body, from nerve to muscle, to liver, to skin. On the nerves, there has been a lot of excitement in getting stem cells to reconnect the ear to the brain. However, this technology will not help the majority of people with hearing loss. Most cases are caused by damage to the delicate hairs that are used to convert the mechanical vibrations to an electrical signal. The team has also been able to turn embryonic stem cells into very early versions of these hairs, however, how to get the hair cells inside the inner ear and restore hearing is still a challenge. They need to face the right direction and be positioned in exactly the right spot. \"It is almost an impossible task,\" said Prof Dave Moore from the Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research. \"It is probably easier to make a whole new ear and put a new one in there.\" The scientists used stem cells taken from a human embryo. They can turn into any other type of cell. They were, using a carefully orchestrated mix of chemicals, turned into cells that were very similar to to the spiral ganglion neurons, and they were delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils. Within 10 weeks, the gerbils had, on average, a 45% restoration of hearing range.

Planes carrying grain, pulses and vegetable oil fly daily from the capital, Juba, or Gambella in Ethiopia and drop hundreds of tonnes of food stuff on drop zones near camps where people have fled. Even fuel for vehicles and generators is transported by air. The UN children's agency Unicef says the escalating crisis means that they have to increase supplies, staff and security officers. \"Malnutrition in Northern Bahr al-Ghazal has gone up threefold and so we have to have three times the amount of supplies to respond to the children's needs,\" says Mahimbo Mdoe, Unicef's representative in South Sudan. The situation, he says, is \"dire\" with up to six million children affected. He warns that unless things change, the situation could get worse for civilians, especially women and children, and it would also be harder for humanitarian workers to reach them.

Machrihanish is among five sites across Britain - three of which are in Scotland - hoping to be a spaceport. The UK government has previously said it wanted to establish a spaceport by the end of 2018. It launched a consultation in 2014 and two years ago it drew up a shortlist of potential sites. These also included Prestwick in South Ayrshire, Stornoway in the Western Isles, Newquay airport in Cornwall and Llanbedr airport in the Snowdonia National Park. In May last year, the government included plans for spaceport licensing in its Queen's Speech. It also opened up the competition in favour of an airport-style licensing system, meaning any suitable location could become a spaceport. The Department for Transport said this would help create \"viable business models at a range of locations\". This meant that Prestwick and Campbeltown are both vying to attract investment to prove they are \"best-placed\" to become the UK's first operational spaceport. Ministers said any future spaceport would be used as a base for space travel and tourism, as well as satellite launches.

He added: \"Our site offers enormous scope with a runway of more than 3,000 metres and large areas of land available for development, allied to a positive and supportive planning framework put in place by Argyll and Bute Council. \"Our safety case is very strong as the site is in a depopulated area and offers the ability to launch directly over the sea.\" Brendan O'Hara, the SNP MP for Argyll and Bute, said basing the spaceport in Kintyre was a \"no-brainer\".

And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world, and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism, scientists say. But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory. Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows, at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now. They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy, doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain, who is leading the research, says: \"There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth. \"It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born, because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain, and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong.\" The study - known as the Developing Human Connectome Project - hopes to look at more than 1,500 babies, studying many aspects of their neurological development. By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and at full term, the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth. And they plan to share their map with the wider research community. Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques, which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now. While in the womb, foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs, and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains. But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements, building up full three-dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion.", "text_ai_base": "By the time a baby takes its first breath, many crucial neural pathways have already been established.

Investigators believe Bilel A, aged 26, was either involved in planning the attack or at least knew about it. Police say they have arrested him on suspicion of benefit fraud as they do not have enough evidence against him. Federal prosecutors' spokeswoman Frauke Koehler told reporters on Wednesday that the suspect had known Amri since the end of 2015 and that the pair had met at a restaurant on the evening before the attack and had \"very intense conversations\". The suspect's home in an asylum shelter had been searched and communication devices taken away for analysis, she added. The man is believed to have used at least two false names in several German cities between April and November 2015. A former flatmate of Amri's is also being investigated as a potential witness. Amri twice tried to contact him on 19 December, although it is unclear whether or not they spoke. Over a fortnight after the attack, German prosecutors have said there is now no doubt that 24-year-old Anis Amri was behind the attack. And investigators across Europe have a clearer picture of what happened on the night of the attack and how Amri fled south to Italy. Police in Italy confirmed on Wednesday that the gun used by Amri to murder Polish driver Lukasz Urban was the same he fired four days later in Milan. Shortly before the attack, Amri is thought to have gone to Friedrich-Krause-Ufer, a street where he shot dead Mr Urban. He then went to a mosque and returned to the lorry to carry out the attack on Breitscheidplatz a few miles away. Amri was then seen on camera a short distance from the square at Zoo station, raising an index finger, a gesture linked to jihadist group Islamic State. What happens next is unclear, but it is thought that he escaped to the North Rhine-Westphalia area of western Germany.

On Wednesday, federal prosecutors' spokeswoman Frauke Koehler stated Bilel had known Amri since late 2015, and they had met for \"very intense conversations\" at a restaurant the evening before the attack. Bilel's home, located in an asylum shelter, was searched by authorities, who confiscated communication devices for examination. He reportedly used at least two false identities in several German cities between April and November 2015. Investigators are also examining a former flatmate of Amri as a potential witness. Amri attempted to contact this person twice on 19 December, though it remains unclear whether they spoke. More than two weeks after the attack, German prosecutors confirmed without doubt that 24-year-old Anis Amri was responsible.

Better mortgage deals have helped absorb some of the \"pent-up demand\", the trade body added. But prices are still likely to continue rising, according to Rics. Separately, figures from mortgage lenders show that the government's recently launched Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme seems to have reduced the size of the average deposit required of first-time buyers. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that in January, the average first-time deposit had fallen to 18%, from 20% in December. However, the number of loans to first-time buyers, and to those moving from a home they already own, fell back because of the normal seasonal lull in the market at this time of year. The number of mortgages granted to home buyers in January was 16% down from December, but was still 30% higher than in January last year, reflecting the upsurge in sales in the past 12 months. This lull in activity may continue according to Simon Rubinsohn, Rics' chief economist. \"The growth in buyer numbers that we've seen for some months started to slow down in February, as the surge in interest sparked towards the end of last summer began to level off,\" he said. \"While this certainly doesn't mean an end to the increasing activity we've been seeing recently, it does suggest that the pent up demand generated throughout the downturn is gradually exhausting itself.\" One other reason for the slowdown could have been last month's bad weather, especially the floods, making people less likely to view properties, Mr Rubinsohn added. But there are still too few properties coming on to the market, Rics said, which means prices are likely to keep going up. The cost of a home in the UK continued to rise during February, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous month, the organisation said. It said 45% more chartered surveyors saw prices rise rather than fall in February. According to its surveys, the cost of a home has now risen across the country for 11 consecutive months. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), released in February, the average price of a UK has now hit \u00c2\u00a3250,000 for the first time.

Dr. Roger Hawkes, executive director of the project, stated that the goal is to add \"scientific rigour\" to the claims about golf's health benefits. \"We've felt that we've underestimated golf's potential impact on health for several years,\" he remarked. \"We have a preliminary review that outlines existing knowledge, and we're planning to examine this research and identify knowledge gaps, so that in five years, we'll have solid evidence.\" Firming up this information through thorough research will provide valuable resources.

The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe. In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection. Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus. It can take Europe\u2019s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today\u2019s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost. That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes. The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece. The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy. \"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc. \"Here, we\u2019ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida. The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan. The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year. Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace. The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight. More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth. There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade. OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.", "text_ai_base": "The network will initially consist of at least 600 spacecraft, with the potential to expand to over 2,000. Its goal is to provide global broadband connectivity from orbit, with a particular focus on connecting schools. Such an extensive constellation necessitates significant advancements in satellite manufacturing, especially for Airbus. Europe's leading space company typically spends months and hundreds of millions on building specialized platforms, but the OneWeb initiative demands high volume and low-cost production. This requires innovative assembly line techniques similar to those used in automotive and aircraft manufacturing, aiming to produce three units per shift at under a million dollars each. Airbus CEO Tom Enders admits he initially considered the OneWeb concept unrealistic. \"Traditionally, everything in space has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work flawlessly, with the most expensive materials, etc. We have had to think differently, focusing on being commercial and cost-effective, which is crucial for the OneWeb business model,\" he explained to BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have launched their first assembly line in Toulouse, France, with two additional lines planned for a new factory complex in Florida. The standout feature of these lines compared to conventional satellite cleanrooms is the trolley robot that transports satellites between work stations. But the transformation goes beyond automation; it involves suppliers and components adjusting to a new production scale. The first 10 satellites from the Toulouse line are scheduled for launch in April next year, with additional batches following in November. The launch frequency will then ramp up significantly. Establishing the OneWeb constellation demands the most extensive rocket campaign in spaceflight history, involving over 20 Soyuz launches to deploy clusters of 32-36 satellites at 1,200 km above Earth. By the end of 2020, nearly 300 satellites should be operational, with over 600 a year later and more than 800 by mid-decade. OneWeb and Airbus are contending with other firms like SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat, and others seeking regulatory approval for similar mega-constellations.

The order is for high number, low cost - playing quite literally on assembly line principles familiar to automotive and aircraft plants, to turn out three units every shift at less than a million dollars a pop. At first, Airbus CEO Tom Enders thought the OneWeb pitch was ludicrous. \"It's all 'gold-plated' in space; it has to be, there's no compromise - and the most expensive materials, etc, etc. We\u2019ve had to change that tremendously; step back and get commercial, get cheap, which is imperative for the multinational economics of the OneWeb project,\" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have married the first of three assembly lines in Toulouse, southern France. The other two will eventually move to an adjacent factory complex in Florida. \"The biggest innovation you can see in this factory compared with any other satellite cleanroom, is our trolley robot; that\u2019s what ferries the satellites around work stations,\" said Airbus Chief Engineer Arnaud de Rosnay. But it is not just about automation: \"It\u2019s a whole ecosystem. From the supply chain to parts, everyone has to learn to do it on another scale.\" The first 10 spacecraft off the French line are set to go to orbit in April next year. Another batch will then follow in November. After that, the launch rate will go ballistic.

At first, Airbus CEO Tom Enders thought the OneWeb pitch was ludicrous. \"It's all 'gold-plated' in space; it has to be, there's no compromise - and the most expensive materials, etc, etc. We\u2019ve had to change that tremendously; step back and get commercial, get cheap, which is imperative for the multinational economics of the OneWeb project,\" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have married the first of three assembly lines in Toulouse, southern France. The other two will eventually move to an adjacent factory complex in Florida. \"The biggest innovation you can see in this factory compared with any other satellite cleanroom, is our trolley robot; that\u2019s what ferries the satellites around work stations,\" said Airbus Chief Engineer Arnaud de Rosnay. But it is not just about automation: \"It\u2019s a whole ecosystem. From the supply chain to parts, everyone has to learn to do it on another scale.\" The first 10 spacecraft off the French line are set to go to orbit in April next year. Another batch will then follow in November. After that, the launch rate will go ballistic. To get the OneWeb constellation up and functioning will require the most concentrated rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight. More than 20 Soyuz vehicles will be tasked with putting clusters of 32-36 spacecraft at 1,200km above the Earth. By the end of 2020, roughly 300 satellites should be in operation, rising to more than 600 a year later, and 800-plus by mid-decade. OneWeb and Airbus have competition. Other companies, such as SpaceX, Boeing and ViaSat, not to mention various other entrepreneurs, are asking regulators for approval of their own mega-constellations. But not everyone is going to find the multi-billion-dollar capital needed to realise their plans in what is an untested marketplace, and Airbus is firmly of the belief that OneWeb has got the inside lane.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 81, "wordsSpent": 749, "remainingCredits": 195802, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Medium", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Back in 2013, British Prime Minister David Cameron promised that if his political party, the Conservatives, won the next general election, then he would let voters have their say on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. Last year, they won the election so it's all systems go. A referendum is a vote in which all adults can take part, normally giving a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of the votes wins. The European Union, or EU, is a group of 28 countries in Europe whose governments work together. It began after World War Two with the idea that the best chance of stopping another war was by countries working more closely together. It's a bit like a club. To join you have to agree to follow the rules and in return you get certain benefits. Each country has to pay money to be a member, which they mostly do through taxes. The EU uses the money to change the way people live and do business in Europe. It has its own parliament, which is made up of politicians called Members of the European Parliament. They are elected by people who live in European Union countries. One of the main jobs of the parliament is to change, approve or reject laws that apply to all EU countries. 1957: Belgium, France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg 1973: Denmark, Ireland and the UK 1981: Greece 1986: Portugal and Spain 1995: Austria, Finland and Sweden 2004: Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Cyprus 2007: Bulgaria and Romania 2013: Croatia One major reason the European Union was set up is trade: to make it easier for countries to buy and sell things to each other. Certain rules to do with immigration have been relaxed too - so people from EU countries can move around more freely inside the Union. EU laws affect many areas of our lives - like how many hours we're allowed to work in a week, health and safety rules, and even how many fish we're allowed to catch. For the 40 years that the UK's been a member of the EU, there's been a debate about our role within it. Some feel being part of this bigger club makes the UK richer and more important.

After winning the election last year, this promise is now moving forward. A referendum is a vote in which all adults can participate, typically answering a \"Yes\" or \"No\" question. The side with more than half the votes wins. The European Union (EU) is a coalition of 28 European countries whose governments collaborate. It was founded after World War Two, based on the belief that closer cooperation among countries could prevent another war. Joining is like becoming part of a club: members must adhere to rules but gain certain advantages. Each member contributes funds, mostly through taxes, which the EU uses to influence how people live and conduct business in Europe. The EU has its own parliament, composed of Members of the European Parliament who are elected by residents of EU countries. One key role of the parliament is to modify, approve, or reject laws applicable to all EU countries.

The EU was largely established to facilitate trade, simplifying buying and selling between countries. Immigration rules have also been eased, allowing freer movement within the Union. EU laws impact numerous aspects of life, such as work hours, health and safety regulations, and even fishing quotas.

But the central bank said it expected the economy to need only \"gradual\" increases in the short term.

Ms Yellen said the rate rise \"should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress that the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue\". Although inflation is still below the Fed's 2% target, it expects the rise in prices to pick up gradually over the medium term. \"The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\" the Fed statement said.

During a post-announcement news conference, Yellen noted it was premature to speculate on Trump's economic strategy without further details.

Dawid Malan , the 28-year-old Middlesex batsman who is in England's Twenty20 squad for Friday's match with Sri Lanka, scored 185 in the 88-run Duckworth-Lewis win against Sri Lanka on 21 July. And established international Sam Billings, who has played five ODIs and seven T20s, made 175 in Sunday's second Lion victory over Pakistan. \"They will raise the standard of English cricket as these young players come into the system and try to nail down their spot,\" Flower told the Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show on BBC Radio 5 live. \"These young players have to challenge for that place. They have played superb individual innings and quite amazing partnerships, that is going to capture the attention of the selectors.\" Flower, a former Essex and Zimbabwe batsman, was England's team director from 2009 to 2014 and was full of praise for Northants opener Duckett, who is only 21. \"He is a really talented young man,\" said Flower. \"None of us know exactly how the future is going to turn out, but there is no reason why he shouldn't have an excellent international career.\"", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 84, "wordsSpent": 548, "remainingCredits": 190507, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Medium", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

A festival marks the anniversary of her death and a Catholic mass is celebrated - a rarity in an Anglican cathedral. This is one of a number of unusual stories to be told in the BBC's People's Passion, which explores the purpose of cathedrals today. Katharine was cast aside by Henry VIII for being unable to provide the Tudor dynasty with a male heir. Stuart Orme, from Vivacity Heritage which co-organises the Katharine of Aragon Festival, said: \"She was revered for her piety and dignity. \"Many of the population had a good deal of sympathy for Katharine after the divorce and felt she had been hard done by.\" Despite living in reduced circumstances after the end of her marriage, she was given an elaborate funeral on 29 January 1536, involving four bishops and six abbots. Her tomb was of black marble, with gilded letters and decoration. Mr Orme said: \"But Oliver Cromwell's soldiers stole the gilding during the sack of the cathedral in 1643, while a dean of the cathedral used the marble for the floor of his summerhouse in the 1700s.\" It was not until the late 19th Century that a wife of one of the cathedral canons, Katharine Clayton, started a public appeal asking all the Katharines of England to donate to the replacement marble slab which can be seen today. The cathedral now marks the funeral date with the Katharine of Aragon Festival on the Friday and Saturday nearest the 29 January. A representative of the Spanish embassy is invited to a civic service on the Friday and a Catholic mass is held on the Saturday. Hundreds of children are encouraged to dress in Tudor costume, and learn how people lived in the early 16th Century from historic re-enactors.

Total sales fell 0.4%. Despite the drop, the UK's second-largest supermarket said it was continuing to make progress. Chief executive Mike Coupe said he was confident its strategy would enable it to \"outperform our major peers\". German discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which have expanded rapidly in the UK, have been undercutting Sainsbury's and its rivals, including Tesco, Morrisons and Asda. The supermarket chain has fought back by cutting prices on its everyday products rather than run promotions. This quarter, it said it had cut the prices of broccoli, onions, Margherita pizza and its own-brand nappies. Mr Coupe said this strategy was working with customers \"consistently choosing\" Sainsbury's over its rivals. He also said its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos-owner Home Retail Group, which was completed at the beginning of this month, would speed up its plans to allow shoppers to get their goods in different ways. Sainsbury's, which already has 15 Argos stores within its own shops, said it would open 200 digital collection points in its stores by the end of the year. The supermarket group said Home Retail Group's like-for-like sales in the second quarter to 27 August, before it took over the firm, rose 2.3%. In another attempt to win more shoppers, and amid the threat of online giant Amazon's move into grocery deliveries, Sainsbury's said it was expanding a test of its one-hour grocery delivery service in London called \"Chop Chop\" with orders delivered by bicycle. The retailer said it would \"give customers more options to shop with us whenever and wherever they want\". Sainsbury's has reported two straight years of falling profits, and analysts expect another drop in the 2016-17 financial year. In May, the supermarket said underlying profits for the year to 12 March fell to \u00a3587m from \u00a3681m in the previous year. Shares in the group have fallen 9% over the past six months. John Ibbotson, director of retail consultancy Retail Vision, said Sainsbury's simpler pricing strategy and abolition of multi-buy promotions was \"distinctly underwhelming\" in the current brutal market conditions, but said Argos could help the firm. \"Argos should boost Sainsbury's bottom line in the short-term as well as improve its internet offer and logistics capability. \"But integrating the two firms will be time-consuming and distracting, and in the current environment Sainsbury's cannot afford to take its eye off its core grocery business, even for a second,\" he added.

Despite these declines, Chief Executive Mike Coupe expressed confidence that their strategy would enable them to outperform major competitors. To counteract challenges from rapidly expanding German discount chains Aldi and Lidl, Sainsbury's has adopted a strategy of lowering prices on everyday products instead of relying on promotions. During this quarter, they reduced the prices of items like broccoli, onions, Margherita pizza, and own-brand nappies. Coupe claimed customers consistently prefer Sainsbury's over rivals. In a significant move, Sainsbury's completed a \u00a31.4bn acquisition of Argos-owner Home Retail Group, aimed at diversifying customer shopping options. Following this, Sainsbury's plans to open 200 digital collection points in its stores by the year's end. Home Retail Group reported a 2.3% rise in like-for-like sales in the second quarter leading to August 27th, prior to Sainsbury's acquisition. Facing competition from online giant Amazon's grocery delivery service, Sainsbury's is also expanding a test of its \"Chop Chop,\" a one-hour delivery service in London using bicycles, enhancing customer shopping flexibility. Sainsbury's has faced two consecutive years of declining profits, with analysts predicting another drop in the 2016-17 fiscal year. Underlying profits for the year ending March 12 fell from \u00a3681m to \u00a3587m. Over the past six months, the group's shares have declined by 9%. John Ibbotson, director of Retail Vision, critiqued Sainsbury's simpler pricing strategy and elimination of multi-buy promotions as \"distinctly underwhelming\" in the current tough market. However, he projected that Argos could positively impact Sainsbury's bottom line and enhance its internet offerings and logistics. He cautioned, though, that integrating the two companies would be demanding, and emphasized the importance of maintaining focus on Sainsbury's core grocery business.

Sainsbury's is also under pressure from online giant Amazon after the expansion of the online retailer's AmazonFresh grocery delivery service. Sainsbury's is also expanding a trial of its one-hour delivery service in London to give customers even more flexibility when they shop.

Investigations at the atomic scale indicate the cement ought to retain this ability for at least 2,000 years. The Sheffield University team believes the new mix is up to 50% better than previously proposed barrier solutions. At some point the government will choose the location of an underground store for the hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of waste built up over more than 60 years of nuclear operations. A lot of this material will be immobilised and backfilled using cement. This cement will need to block the passage of radioisotopes far into the future.

Their optimum cement - known currently simply as No7 - contains blast-furnace slag. The sulphides this introduces react with water to produce sulphate mineral phases that are exceptionally good at sorbing technetium-99. \"It's a high-yield fission product; it's only found in nuclear reactors; it's very mobile in the environment - but what we found is that our cement will actually lock tight this technetium-99 into its structure and prevent it being transported into the environment,\" explained Dr Corkhill. The team's investigations show No7 to be a much better performer than the currently proposed cement barrier, called Nirex Reference Vault Backfill. But this is not the end of the story - further mixes are being investigated to find even more effective solutions. The cement work has been discussed here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) - as has the long-duration experiment facility at Diamond.

Neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016.\" Monday's game marks the start of England's qualifying for the tournament in France, which will see 24 teams compete at a European Championships for the first time. Media playback is not supported on this device After playing Switzerland, Hodgson's side will play a further nine Group E games over the course of the next 13 months as they look to secure their place at the finals. The top two in each group will qualify for the tournament automatically, along with the best third-placed side. The eight other third-place sides will then contest play-offs. England's last competitive game was the goalless draw in a dead rubber against Costa Rica in Brazil in June, which saw them go out at the group stage after defeats to Italy and Uruguay. Hodgson, who was appointed England manager in 2012 and led them to the quarter-finals of the European Championships that year, admits the pain of the World Cup still lingers. However, he claims arguably the most testing fixture in England's Euro 2016 group does not mean a completely fresh start as he looks to build towards the European Championship finals in two years' time. \"We are not in an embryonic stage,\" he added. \"We are carrying on, despite the massive blow of the World Cup.

Asked whether he was now seeing the nasty side of being England manager after post-World Cup criticism, Hodgson said: \"There is no nasty side. I love this job. It's a magnificent job.

Automatic qualification is granted to the top two teams in each group, along with the best third-placed side. The remaining third-place teams will compete in play-offs. England's previous competitive encounter ended in a goalless draw against Costa Rica in Brazil last June, eliminating them from the group stage after losses to Italy and Uruguay. Hodgson, appointed in 2012 and having led England to the Euro quarter-finals that year, acknowledges the lingering disappointment from the World Cup. Still, he asserts that this challenging fixture in the Euro 2016 qualifiers isn't an entirely fresh start, as he prepares for the upcoming European Championship finals. \"We\u2019re not in the early stages of development,\" he noted. \"We're progressing, despite the World Cup setback.

The PIDG said it had revised its travel policy, which had seen board members claiming for more expensive flexible business class tickets. But Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the Department for International Development (DfID) was to blame for not keeping a tight enough rein on spending. \"It's outrageous that 15 flights were booked from 2011, each costing over \u00a35,000,\" said Mrs Hodge. \"Only this month has PIDG revised its travel policy. DfID should get a grip on administrative costs like this.\" The PIDG was founded in 2002 by four countries - the UK, Switzerland, Holland and Sweden - to back private investment in infrastructure projects in developing countries, including roads, telecoms, sanitation, housing, agriculture, power and industry.

UK funding for the agency was increased fivefold by the coalition government in 2011, in line with its policy of encouraging private investment in the developing world.

Ms Sturgeon confirmed to the BBC that talks are under way with Gibraltar. Northern Ireland could also potentially be included in the discussions. \"I can imagine a situation where some parts of what is today the member state United Kingdom are stripped out and others remain,\" Mr Picardo told Newsnight. \"That means that we don't have to apply again for access, we simply remain with the access we have today, and those parts that leave are then given a different sort of access, which is negotiated but not necessarily under Article 50,\" he said, referring to a provision in the Lisbon Treaty that sets out how a member state can voluntarily leave the Union.

I'm not sure that many of us would quite know what to do when handed a giant vegetable in front of a pack of photographers. But it won't be surprising to see it all over the newspapers and stuck in people's memories. And it was a reminder that before Mr Corbyn even tries to win the battles he will certainly face this week - over nuclear weapons, over how to balance the country's books, or over the way Labour makes its decisions - his team's priority must be, get through the week without mishap. For party conferences are strange, intense, microclimates where the what is said on the stage, however carefully crafted or considered, can be subsumed by our old friends, \"events\", however silly. And sometimes those are the moments that shift opinion, or express a truth political parties don't want to contemplate. And occasionally, they are the moments senior politicians lose control. In 2003 I remember seeing Conservative aides grimace during the then leader Iain Duncan Smith's speech, as he promised the \"quiet man\" was \"turning up the volume\". That week, everywhere Conservatives had been huddled in corners wondering how to unseat him. His strangely delivered speech contributed to his ultimate exit. In 2006 I remember Cherie Blair's unguarded, and then denied remark, whizzed round the conference centre in 2006, when she cried out \"it's a lie\" when Gordon Brown heaped praise on her husband. Nothing expressed the levels of bitterness between the two camps so well. In 2008, it wasn't just the rather silly picture of him clutching a banana that put David Miliband onto the front pages, but that he'd been overheard talking of avoiding a \"Heseltine moment\". His leadership ambitions were what made the conference banana moment worth printing. The year before, when Sir Menzies Campbell was already under attack for lacklustre leadership of the Liberal Democrats, I recall the uncomfortable press visit to an environmentally friendly house outside Bournemouth, where aides allowed him to be photographed while inspecting an organic toilet.

Many of us would be unsure of how to react when handed a giant vegetable in front of a crowd of photographers.

Such moments can change perceptions or reveal truths that political parties might prefer to ignore, and at times, they lead to senior politicians losing control. I recall back in 2003, watching Conservative aides cringe during a speech by their leader, Iain Duncan Smith, as he vowed the \"quiet man\" would \"turn up the volume.\" Throughout that week, Conservatives convened in corners, pondering how to replace him, with his awkward speech contributing to his eventual exit. In 2006, Cherie Blair's spontaneous and later denied remark, \"It's a lie,\" when Gordon Brown praised her husband, rapidly circulated the conference center, exposing the deep bitterness between their factions.

The previous year, Sir Menzies Campbell was already under scrutiny for lackluster leadership of the Liberal Democrats. I vividly remember the awkward media visit to an eco-friendly house near Bournemouth, where aides allowed him to be photographed examining an organic toilet. That moment epitomized the shortcomings of his party apparatus, and weeks later, he departed. For Labour this week, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \"marrow moment\" may quickly fade from memory.

Despite being part of England's squad for the recent T20 series against South Africa, Overton didn't play, yet his crucial spell here shifted the momentum. With Liam Dawson (53) and Adams establishing a steady opening partnership, Overton edged out Adams and had Rossouw caught by Steven Davies, marking Rossouw's fifth duck in his last eight County Championship innings. Dawson was soon dismissed lbw by Lewis Gregory (3-51), and despite James Vince's 47, Hampshire's batting crumbled under Leach's precise left-arm spin. Securing a batting point, Hampshire skipper George Bailey declared, but Marcus Trescothick (10 not out) and newcomer Eddie Byrom, unbeaten on one, comfortably reached stumps under the floodlights. Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson commented to BBC Solent, \"The crowd numbers haven\u2019t changed yet. It\u2019s early days, and it might eventually work.

It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. \"Think of your car in the 1970s\", David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. \"The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. \"We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology.\" Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. \"It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds\", David says.", "text_ai_base": "Once again, you sympathize with the families of those who perished and those who survived the disaster aboard these flights. Such tragedies seem relentless. Within a year, two Malaysian aircraft have vanished, along with 537 passengers. The AirAsia incident on its December route to Singapore claimed 162 lives. It's not just the crashes themselves; it's the alarming fact that entire planes are suddenly plummeting without warning. Given this, one might assume air travel is becoming increasingly perilous, but this is a misconception. When you consider the number of accidents and fatalities relative to the vast numbers flying today\u20143.2 billion passengers last year\u2014we are actually in a golden era of aviation safety. Safety analysts at Ascend report that 2014 was nearly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, an improvement over the previous year's rate of one accident per 1.91 million flights. This statistic excludes the Malaysian airliner lost over Ukraine, where 298 lives were claimed, as it is classified as a war loss rather than an accident. Even if you include that incident, the year fares relatively well historically. The Aviation Safety Network documented 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the prior year. These figures are grim, yet pale compared to 1972 when 2,370 passengers died\u2014and far fewer people flew back then, possibly only a quarter of today's numbers. Why has flying become safer? Primarily, technological advancements. David Learmount from Flightglobal illustrates, \"Think of a car in the 1970s\u2014the brakes, handling, lack of safety features. Aircraft follow a similar pattern.\" While aerodynamics were well understood by the 1940s, technological advancements have made significant impacts. Every new aircraft generation surpasses the previous in safety through better computers, designs, and materials. Yet, there's another critical aspect contributing to this safety increase: each tragedy educates designers further. A couple of decades back, Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) was the leading cause of aviation fatalities\u2014a seemingly innocuous term describing catastrophic outcomes when aircraft inadvertently collide with unseen terrain during landing, often due to nearby hills. The introduction of the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System marked a turning point in preventing such incidents. \"It's akin to a sat nav that guides flights through hills and mountains, even in cloudy conditions,\" David explains.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Again, you feeling sympathy for the families, both those who lost a loved one and those who survived that disaster on the flights.

Ascend\u2019s safety analysts say 2014 almost the safest year ever (just one fatal crash every 2.38 million flights, which is better then last year\u2019s one per 1.91 million flights). Therefore the Malaysian jet that went down over Ukraine (298 people lost) is not counted here because it\u2019s recorded as a war loss not an accident.

Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.

The downturn began in 2013 when McLaren lost its edge in chassis design despite having the best engine. Currently, while they've regained form with the car, the Honda power unit remains problematic. This situation starkly contrasts their historic partnership with Honda\u2014a collaboration that once marked the pinnacle of their success in F1. In 1988, with legends Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, McLaren dominated by winning 15 out of 16 races, outshining even Mercedes' later achievements. They continued this dominance for four more years, then faced a significant downturn similar to today's, before bouncing back with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Remarkably, the team's last constructors' title was at the start of those victories with the 'Flying Finn.' In 2007, they almost recaptured former glory when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were teammates, finishing the season tied for points, just a single point behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. However, after being caught with Ferrari's technical documents, McLaren was disqualified from the constructors' championship and fined $100 million. Another scandal followed two years later, dubbed 'lie-gate,' after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan misled stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to Hamilton's public apology and Ryan's dismissal. Victory was frequent until 2012, with Hamilton and Jenson Button winning seven races, but aside from Hamilton's 2008 title, championships became elusive\u2014and now wins are scarce. McLaren's current struggles aren't entirely unexpected.

Mr Morales, who has been in power since 2006, and his supporters wanted him to be able to run for another term. With almost all the votes counted, the \"No\" camp had a narrow but irreversible lead over those favouring another term for Mr Morales. This means the constitutional ban on serving more than two consecutive five-year terms remains in place. Despite the constitutional ban on serving more than two consecutive terms, President Evo Morales was allowed to run for a third term in 2014. The constitutional court argued that the ban did not apply to Mr Morales' initial term because it had taken place before the new constitution came into effect. Mr Morales will now not be able to stand in presidential elections in 2019. But he is expected to continue serving out the remainder of his term, which ends in 2020. When provisional results suggested a win for the \"No\" campaign, Mr Morales said that \"the fight will continue\" and his administration would follow through with its plans. Critics within his party hope he will start training up a potential successor, while opposition politicians see it as a chance to challenge the governing parties. Mr Morales said he had \"lost a battle, but not the war\". There were celebrations in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, an opposition stronghold. Many opposition politicians and some within Mr Morales's party said the outcome was a victory for democracy. Former President Carlos Mesa said it showed that \"no one is indispensable\". Samuel Doria Medina, who lost three times to Mr Morales in presidential elections said that Bolivia had won. \"They [the government] called this referendum and the people told them 'no',\" he tweeted. Mr Morales won the presidential election with 61% of the vote last year. There is still widespread support for Mr Morales and his economic programme but many felt a change to the constitution was a step too far. Some within the ranks of his own party also felt it was time for new, younger politicians to be given a chance to run.

Published in the Lancet Psychiatry, their analysis of 61 separate studies suggests nicotine in cigarette smoke may be altering the brain. Experts said it was a \"pretty strong case\" but needed more research. Smoking has long been associated with psychosis, but it has often been believed that schizophrenia patients are more likely to smoke because they use cigarettes as a form of self-medication to ease the distress of hearing voices or having hallucinations. The team at King's looked at data involving 14,555 smokers and 273,162 non-smokers. It indicated: The argument is that if there is a higher rate of smoking before schizophrenia is diagnosed, then smoking is not simply a case of self-medication. Dr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's, said: \"It's very difficult to establish causation [with this style of study], what we're hoping that this does is really open our eyes to the possibility that tobacco could be a causative agent in psychosis, and we hope this will then lead to other research and clinical trials that would help to provide firmer evidence.\" Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk. The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking. The researchers said nicotine altered levels of the brain chemical dopamine, which has already been implicated in the psychosis. Prof Michael Owen, the director of the Institute of Psychological Medicine at Cardiff University, said the researchers had made a \"pretty strong case\" that smoking may increase the risk of schizophrenia. \"The fact is that it is very hard to prove causation without a randomised trial, but there are plenty of good reasons already for targeting public health measures very energetically at the mentally ill.\" The charity Rethink Mental Illness said: \"We know that 42% of all cigarettes smoked in England are by people with mental health problems, and so any new findings about the link between smoking and psychosis is a potential worry. \"However, longer-term studies are needed to fully understand this potential link.\"", "text_ai_base": "The team at King's College London suggests that smokers are more likely to develop schizophrenia and at a younger age.

Experts said the study - which can not prove smoking is a cause - was \"timely\" but that further investigation was still required. The association between smoking and schizophrenia is well known. People with the disorder are more likely to smoke than other people and more likely to smoke heavily, too. But it had been widely assumed that patients with schizophrenia were using cigarettes as a form of self-medication to control the symptoms. But the team at King s say there is enough evidence to suggest smoking increases the risk of developing the disorder. Guidance Schizophrenia is often described as psychotic illness. It can cause symptoms ranging from disturbing hallucinations to slurred speech or flattened emotions. People who smoke are more likely to develop schizophrenia and at an earlier age, according to the research team, which analysed data from 14,555 smokers and 273,162 non-smokers. If there was nothing more to the relationship than self-medication, then people with schizophrenia would be no more or less likely to be smoking when diagnosed than the rest of the population.

In their report, the team said: \"Daily tobacco use is associated with an increased risk of psychosis and an earlier age at onset of psychotic illness. \"The finding that psychosis onset is earlier in smokers than in non-smokers, suggests that smoking may have a causal role.\" Dr James MacCabe, of King's Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, told the BBC: \"It's very difficult to answer if smoking is a cause, it could be that it comes before. \"But we think there is enough evidence in this study that we should start thinking seriously whether tobacco could actually be a causative agent in psychosis. \"It's not proof at this stage, the evidence is just there as the smoking rates are higher. \"We think it is possible and plausible that there is a causal link between smoking and schizophrenia, but a lot more research will be needed to understand it.\" More studies The most important question then is: \"Will stopping smoking lower the risk?\" Dr MacCabe said: \"That's a really interesting question and the honest truth is we don't know.\" Research in more than 17,000 patients showed that smokers developed the disorder a year earlier than those who never smoked. But the vast majority of smokers do not go on to develop schizophrenia, while some patients develop it regardless of whether they smoke.

They say it is time to consider whether cigarette smoke makes the brain more vulnerable. Lancet Psychiatry's analysis of 61 separate studies hints that nicotine in cigarette smoke may be altering the mind. Experts said the study - which can not prove smoking is a cause - was \"timely\" but that further investigation was still required. The association between smoking and schizophrenia is well known. People with the disorder are more likely to smoke than other people and more likely to smoke heavily, too. But it had been widely assumed that patients with schizophrenia were using cigarettes as a form of self-medication to control the symptoms. But the team at King s say there is enough evidence to suggest smoking increases the risk of developing the disorder. Guidance Schizophrenia is often described as psychotic illness. It can cause symptoms ranging from disturbing hallucinations to slurred speech or flattened emotions. People who smoke are more likely to develop schizophrenia and at an earlier age, according to the research team, which analysed data from 14,555 smokers and 273,162 non-smokers.

The couple, who live in Newham, acted after accusing Kristy of controlling and adversely influencing a young boy, the jury was told. They originally came from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where witchcraft is called Kindoki, and exorcisms are carried out in some churches. In 2010, Unicef reported 20,000 children accused of witchcraft were living on the streets of DR Congo's capital Kinshasa. In the DR Congo, accusing a child of being possessed is a criminal offence, a law that has been in place for several years. But in 2008 I travelled to Kinshasa to see if it was making any difference and, at that time, the answer was not at all. Which is why I found myself in one of the city's slums late at night knocking on the door of tin-roofed shack that doubled as a church. Pastor Tsimba let me in and showed me three children who he had diagnosed as having Kindoki. The youngest was probably six, the oldest no more than 12. They had been in the church for days, deprived of food and forced to work. Their parents were paying for the privilege. The only light came from flickering candles and storm lamps. The pastor began to shout and pray. One by one he brought the children up to the front of the church. He ordered them to lie down and, still shouting and chanting, began slapping their stomachs, one, two, three times. Each harder than the last. Then he took a candle and poured burning hot wax on them, leaving them grimacing and squirming but making almost no sound. Their eyes were wide and staring. Finally, as a bizarre conclusion to the ritual, Pastor Tsimba produced a length of pipe and held it hard against their belly buttons. One after another, he made a play of sucking hard on the pipe and in triumph then spat a lump of meat he claimed to have sucked out of them into a bowl. The meat he claimed had been been fed to them by a witch, infecting them with Kindoki. The children, bewildered and quiet, were now in his words \"delivered\". I alerted a social worker to the plight of the children. An extraordinary and dedicated man, he said he would do all he could to help them.

But the year marked an important milestone when - aged just 22 - he broke the 800m, one mile and 1,500m world records within the space of just 41 days. He was the first person to hold all three records at the same time. He also won Sports Personality of the Year. 1980 - First Olympic medals Coe will always be remembered for his Olympic success. In 1980, amid intense rivalry with fellow British runner Steve Ovett, he won gold in the 1,500m in Moscow. He took silver in his preferred race - the 800m - finishing second to Ovett. 1984 - Second Olympic Gold Despite spending months fighting illness, Coe returned to the Olympic track in Los Angeles four years later and became the first man to win successive 1,500m golds, beating fellow Briton Steve Cram into second (Ovett failed to finish the race). Coe was beaten into second again in the 800m by Joaquim Cruz. 1992 - Enters Parliament After retiring from athletics in 1990, Coe pursued a career in politics and was chosen to fight the Falmouth and Camborne constituency for the Conservatives at the 1992 election. Coe beat the Liberal Democrat candidate by more than 3,000 votes and took his place in Parliament. He lost the seat in 1997 when Tony Blair's Labour Party swept to power. He briefly returned to politics as chief of staff to William Hague, when he was Leader of the Opposition. 2005 - Helps secure Olympics for London Despite London lagging in third place behind Paris and Madrid in early stages, the UK capital secured the games under Coe's leadership. Sports commentators said a speech he made, shortly before the vote, helped turn the race in London's favour. \"This is almost entirely on a different planet to winning the gold medals,\" Coe said at the time. He went on to become Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and is said to have been a key player in organising the Queen's appearance in the James Bond scene in the Games' opening ceremony. 2015 - Elected president of the IAAF Despite one of the most impressive CVs in athletics history, Lord Coe suggested his election as IAAF chief topped all his achievements.

Despite fierce competition with his fellow Brit, Steve Ovett, Coe won gold in the 1,500m and claimed silver in his favored 800m race, where he finished behind Ovett. Four years later, in 1984, Coe overcame illness to return to the Olympic track in Los Angeles.

Coe remarked that organizing the Olympics was \"on a different planet\" compared to winning medals. He became Chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympics and Paralympics and significantly contributed to the Queen's appearance in the James Bond scene during the opening ceremony.

Police and the military have sealed off my home. I am unable to leave. Nobody is allowed to come in to see me. I am also under an electronic arrest. My house has no internet connection,\" Mr Besigye said. \"The regime here is showing its true nature, a nature of naked force. \"There's no electoral process. It's a creeping military coup.\" This was the fourth election Mr Besigye fought against his one-time ally President Museveni who has ruled Uganda for 30 years. Mr Besigye used to be Mr Museveni's personal doctor when the two were waging a guerilla warfare together in the country's jungles. He was reportedly put under house arrest to prevent him from trying to declare the tally of votes he had received, independent of the electoral commission. Mr Museveni, 71, seized power in 1986 and was widely credited for restoring order and achieving steady economic progress in Uganda. But he now stands accused of becoming increasingly authoritarian. Uganda presidential vote marred by violence, opposition cries of fraud Among those who congratulated Mr Museveni was Tanzania's President John Magufuli, who described Thursday's election as transparent. John Mahama, the president of neighbouring Ghana, on Sunday also congratulated Mr Museveni, his spokesman said. Mr Museveni's nearest rival, former prime minister Amama Mbabazi, meanwhile tweeted: \"Currently under house arrest. Simply a tactic to keep me from declaring my voice\" and did not elaborate. In a tweet, the National Resistance Movement announced its victory and said that President Yoweri Kagita Museveni's \"opponents continued to inform the public that they didn't present any alternative\".

Mulbah broke the deadlock in a goalmouth scramble on 58 minutes and completed the rout after Sarkoh punished a blunder from Algeria goalkeeper Malek Asselah.

Based on a photo in Mao's Little Red Book, the portrait series is among the most famous images of the 20th Century. The auction of this work is expected to fetch as much as $15m (\u00a312.1m). This particular Mao portrait was sold in 2014 in London for \u00a37.6m ($9.4m) and the current owner, who is not identified, has now put it up for sale with Sotheby's in Hong Kong, with the auction expected on 2 April. Warhol began his series of silk-screen portraits of Mao in 1972 when ties between then cold-war foes China and US began to thaw after the historic trip to Beijing by US President Richard Nixon. The photograph that Warhol used for the portrait was one that adorned the inside cover of the so-called Little Red Book, itself an symbol of Chinese communism and a work of propaganda. More than a billion copies are thought to have been published, making the book one of the most widely produced of all time. During Mao's reign it became virtually mandatory to own and carry a copy. Warhol's Mao series led to almost 200 portraits in similar versions and sizes and follows the artist's similar earlier works on Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley in the 1960s. Picking Mao was a departure from his trademark of elevating a banal commodity (as he did with Campbell soup) or illuminating glamour (as he did with Marilyn Monroe). Chairman Mao was a political leader both deeply revered and feared and certainly an unlikely subject for the bold colour contrasts of the Pop Art movement. But it remains a delicate issue in China to this day. In a 2013 exhibition, the first comprehensive survey of Warhol's art in China, the Mao portraits were nowhere to be seen. The debate in Chinese media at the time was around whether the images were showing respect or mockery. Yet Chinese investors are increasingly buying Western art. They are thought to make up one fifth of the world's buyers of art. Downward pressure on the yuan and caps on capital outflows are only adding to the appetite for investing on the global art scene. So Warhol's portrait of China's former Communist leader may yet find its way to China through the workings of global capital markets. Reporting by the BBC's Andreas Illmer.", "text_ai_base": "The portraits transformed the founder of China's Communist Party into a pop art icon, reminiscent of Warhol's takes on Marilyn Monroe and Campbell's soup cans. Originating from a photo in Mao's Little Red Book, this portrait series stands as one of the 20th century's most iconic images. The forthcoming auction is anticipated to reach up to $15 million (\u00a312.1 million). This particular Mao portrait was sold in 2014 in London for \u00a37.6 million ($9.4 million), and the anonymous current owner is now offering it through Sotheby's in Hong Kong, with the auction set for April 2. Warhol initiated his Mao silk-screen portrait series in 1972, coinciding with the U.S. and China's warming relations following President Nixon\u2019s historic Beijing visit. The photograph Warhol employed was featured on the Little Red Book's inside cover, a symbol of Chinese communism and propaganda. Over a billion copies have been published, making it one of the most widely distributed books ever. During Mao's rule, owning and carrying a copy was nearly compulsory. Warhol's series yielded almost 200 variations and sizes, paralleling his earlier works on Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley in the 1960s. Choosing Mao marked a shift from Warhol\u2019s focus on mundane commodities or glamorous subjects. Chairman Mao was a revered yet feared political figure, an unusual choice for Pop Art\u2019s bold colors. Today, it remains a sensitive subject in China. In 2013, a major Warhol exhibition excluded the Mao portraits, sparking debate in Chinese media over whether they represented respect or satire. Nevertheless, Chinese investors are increasingly purchasing Western art, constituting about one-fifth of global art buyers. Economic pressures like the yuan's decline and capital control measures are fueling interest in international art investments. Thus, Warhol's depiction of Mao might eventually find its place in China via global markets.

Warhol began his silk-screen portrait series around Mao Zedong in 1972 - shortly after the US and China began to mend relations following President Richard Nixon's ground-breaking visit to Beijing. The photo Warhol used was printed on the back flap of the inside cover of the Little Red Book, the \"bible\" of Chinese communism and propaganda. More than a billion of its copies are thought to have been printed, making it one of the most printed books in history. During Mao's reign it was said to be close to compulsory for every Chinese to carry one around with them. From those Mao beginnings, Warhol went on to create almost 200 variations of the portrait in different versions and sizes, much like his paintings of Marilyn Munroe and Elvis Presley in the 1960s. But with Warhol choosing Mao, it was the first time he depicted an everyday object or a glamorous pop icon. Read more the Campbell soup can that started it all He was a highly admired yet equally feared political figure - and obviously a very unusual motif for brightly coloured Pop Art. And he's a similarly unusual motif today, still somewhat of a taboo in China. In 2013, Mao portraits were omitted from a major Warhol retrospective on display in Beijing and Shanghai. The move led to an open debate on whether the artworks signalled admiration for infamous affection for the pop culture or mockery of the founder of Communist China. Getty Images More than a billion copies of Chairman Mao's Little Red Book were printed across China \"'Is Warhol mocking, ridiculing or praising the communist leader?'\" one article asked.. Ultimately, it was too sensitive to be openly displayed. And yet, more and more Chinese investors are buying Western art, regardless of the theme.

It will go under the hammer there on 2 April. Warhol began his silk-screen portrait series around Mao Zedong in 1972 - shortly after the US and China began to mend relations following President Richard Nixon's ground-breaking visit to Beijing. The photo Warhol used was printed on the back flap of the inside cover of the Little Red Book, the \"bible\" of Chinese communism and propaganda. More than a billion of its copies are thought to have been printed, making it one of the most printed books in history. During Mao's reign it was said to be close to compulsory for every Chinese to carry one around with them. From those Mao beginnings, Warhol went on to create almost 200 variations of the portrait in different versions and sizes, much like his paintings of Marilyn Munroe and Elvis Presley in the 1960s. But with Warhol choosing Mao, it was the first time he depicted an everyday object or a glamorous pop icon.

And he's a similarly unusual motif today, still somewhat of a taboo in China. In 2013, Mao portraits were omitted from a major Warhol retrospective on display in Beijing and Shanghai. The move led to an open debate on whether the artworks signalled admiration for infamous affection for the pop culture or mockery of the founder of Communist China.

Luke McGrath and Taqele Naiyaravoro swapped tries in the third quarter. With winger Naiyaravoro sin-binned, Leinster edged ahead with a penalty try and McFadden landed a late penalty. The visitors, boosted by six returning Scotland internationals and seeking a first away win over Leinster since 2011, broke the deadlock in the 13th minute, with a multi-phase attack that finished with the 19-year-old prop Fagerson muscling over from close range. Weir's conversion was quickly followed by McFadden's first successful penalty. A second right-sided kick from the winger closed the gap to one by the 21st minute, rewarding Aaron Dundon for a well-won ruck penalty and accurate line-out throw in the build-up. Weir then punished Leinster for collapsing an advancing maul, punching over a fine 43-metre strike. He repeated the trick from the opposite left wing as Mike McCarthy infringed at a maul six minutes before the interval. Leinster missed a chance to close out the first half with a third penalty, McFadden wobbling an injury-time effort wide after Pat MacArthur saw yellow for a 'reckless' forearm-led tackle that ended Dundon's involvement in the game. The home side made their numerical advantage count on the resumption. Scrum-half McGrath's blindside switch led to Garry Ringrose racing up the right touchline and following a bout of forward pressure, McGrath stretched over for McFadden to convert. Leinster were only level for six minutes, the Scots hitting back with a terrific spell of attacking and a power-packed finish to the right of the posts by big Fijian Naiyaravoro. But the hosts took the lead for the first time through the penalty try. Replacement Isaac Boss exploited a gap and Isa Nacewa's well-weighted kick set up a foot race between McFadden and Naiyaravoro. The latter was deemed to have deliberately slapped the ball over the end-line as the pair lunged for the ball. After consulting with the TMO, referee Ian Davies awarded the penalty try and sin-binned the Fijian, with McFadden's conversion splitting the sides on the scoreboard.

The visiting team, strengthened by the return of six Scotland internationals and aiming for their first away victory over Leinster since 2011, broke the deadlock in the 13th minute. This came after a series of phases ended with 19-year-old prop Fagerson pushing over from close distance. Weir converted the try, and shortly after, McFadden succeeded with his first penalty. Another penalty from the winger narrowed the lead by the 21st minute, crediting Aaron Dundon's efforts during a ruck penalty and precise line-out. Weir capitalized on another Leinster mistake, slotting a brilliant 43-meter penalty following a maul collapse. He repeated a similar kick six minutes before halftime after Mike McCarthy was penalized at a maul. Leinster missed an opportunity to score a third penalty when McFadden\u2019s attempt drifted wide following a yellow card issued to Pat MacArthur for a reckless tackle that sidelined Dundon. Resuming play, Leinster leveraged their numerical advantage; scrum-half McGrath initiated a play that saw Garry Ringrose sprint up the touchline, culminating in McGrath's converted try by McFadden. However, the scores were level for just six minutes. The Scots responded with strong attack sequences, culminating in Naiyaravoro's powerful try. Leinster regained the lead with a penalty try; substitute Isaac Boss found an opening leading to Isa Nacewa's kick, which Naiyaravoro was judged to have intentionally knocked over the line, leading to his sin-binning after a TMO review.

It comes after Lochte lied about being robbed at gunpoint by a policeman after a night out during the Rio Olympics. Lochte, a 12-time Olympic medalist, has earned millions of dollars through endorsements. Speedo, the biggest sponsor of the four, said: \"We cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for.\" Lochte, aged 32, said he respected Speedo's decision, and thanked the company. \"I am grateful for the opportunities that our partnership has afforded me over the years,'' he said. Speaking on US talk show Today, Lochte said: \"I made a mistake and I definitely learned from this. They put on a great Games... and my immature, intoxicated behaviour tarnished that a little.\" Ralph Lauren, which has removed some of Lochte's images from its website, said its sponsorship of the swimmer had been only for the Rio Olympics and would not be renewed. Ralph Lauren and Airweave both stressed that they would continue their support of the US Olympic and Paralympic teams. Syneron-Candela said: \"We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners.'' Speedo said it would donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte's sponsorship fee to the charity Save The Children's Brazilian operation. The value of Lochte's Speedo sponsorship has not been disclosed. The contract reportedly expires this year after 10 years. The US business magazine Forbes calculated that in the year of the 2012 London Olympics, Lochte earned about $2m in sponsorships from companies such as Gillette, Nissan, AT&T and Gatorade. Lochte's performance at Rio did not reach the heights of his London triumph, but Forbes estimated his endorsements would still have been between $1m-$2m. The saga started when Lochte and three team-mates returned to the Olympic village after a late night out in Rio. They tried, unsuccessfully, to use the locked toilet at a garage and urinated outside instead. After first claiming that he and his three team-mates had been robbed by bogus policemen, Lochte back-tracked and admitted he had, while still drunk, \"left details out\" and \"over-exaggerated some parts of the story\". Despite the evidence against him, including CCTV footage, he has however denied that he actually lied in his initial account to Brazilian police. Lochte's behaviour has been met with disdain in the US and he has been widely pilloried in the US media. On 19 August the New York Post carried a front-page headline describing him as the \"Ugly American\", along with the slogan \"Liar, Liar, Speedo on fire\".", "text_ai_base": "Following Ryan Lochte's false claim about being robbed at gunpoint during the Rio Olympics, skin care company Syneron-Candela and Japanese mattress maker Airweave issued announcements.

On a US talk show, he admitted, \"I made a mistake and learned from it. My immature, intoxicated behavior tarnished the Games.\" Ralph Lauren, which had a short-term sponsorship with Lochte for the Rio Olympics, removed his images from its website and won't renew the contract. Both Ralph Lauren and Airweave continue to support the US Olympic and Paralympic teams. Syneron-Candela emphasized their high standards for employees and partners. Speedo decided to donate $50,000 from Lochte's sponsorship fee to Save The Children's Brazilian program. Although the exact value of Lochte's Speedo deal is undisclosed, the contract ends this year after a decade. Forbes estimated Lochte earned roughly $2 million in endorsements during the 2012 London Olympics. Despite a less stellar performance in Rio, Forbes expected his endorsements to range between $1 million and $2 million. The controversy began when Lochte and teammates returned to the Olympic village after a late night and, unable to access a locked toilet at a garage, urinated outside. They initially claimed they were robbed by fake police but later, Lochte admitted to exaggerating the story while intoxicated. Although evidence, including CCTV footage, contradicts his account, Lochte denied lying to Brazilian police.

French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron proposed drafting a new mission statement for the EU and putting it to a referendum across all member states. \"We've never had the courage to organize a true European referendum in its real sense,\" he said at a conference. \"We would first build this new project with European peoples and then submit this new roadmap, this new project, to a referendum [across the bloc].\" The first summit of EU leaders without British representation is set for Wednesday, the day after Mr. Cameron's discussions with members.

Police in Ferguson, Missouri, were criticised for being heavy-handed in dealing with protests sparked by the shooting of Michael Brown in August. The funds requested by Mr Obama would be spread over three years and some of the money will go towards purchasing 50,000 body cameras for police officers as well as resources to reform law enforcement departments. Body cameras can provide evidence of encounters between police and civilians, particularly in disputed cases such as the Ferguson shooting.

He complied. Perhaps unsurprisingly considering the \"important squad meeting\" was a day-trip to the city's Oktoberfest beer festival. With the skipper alongside them, the first-team squad made so merry that one of their number failed to make the midnight flight home. European rugby officials were not amused, however.

The suggestion that Saracens should be the template for others did not seem justified by the north London's club history. True, they had been denied their first Premiership title the previous season only by a dramatic late Dan Hipkiss try. But for many years Sarries had been a middling club, rarely competitive when the going got tough and rarely threatening to win anything. Eight months after the Oktoberfest jaunt, they won their first Premiership title. Three years further on and they were within two games of a Heineken Cup and Premiership double, facing Toulon and Northampton on successive Saturdays. Defeat by the French side on Saturday denied them the first of those, but success in the second remains within their grasp. Before taking up his role with Saracens, Edward Griffiths was chief executive of the South African Rugby Union. He has been credited with ensuring that the 1995 World Cup-winning Springboks side learned all the verses of the new national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, and coming up with the slogan 'one team, one country'. The 'cult of Saracens' - as some have dubbed their way of doing things - is certainly taken seriously now with Griffiths as its charismatic, unorthodox high priest.

The hospital involved has categorically rejected the family's claims. The woman's burial has been postponed while further investigations are carried out. Milluzzo was admitted to Cannizzaro hospital in the Sicilian city of Catania on 29 September after suffering complications and going into premature labour in her 19th week of pregnancy. She had had fertility treatment at another health centre. She was in a stable condition in hospital for more than a fortnight but on 15 October her blood pressure and temperature dropped and her condition worsened. According to the family's lawyer, one of the foetuses was suffering breathing problems. The lawyer alleges that the gynaecologist refused to abort the foetuses in order to save the mother and said: \"As long as it's alive, I will not intervene.\" No action was taken while the troubled foetus was still alive and hours later both had died, the lawyer said. Overnight, the mother's condition deteriorated and she contracted an infection. On 16 October she was transferred to intensive care, where she died. Angelo Pellicano, the head of the Cannizzaro hospital, said the lawyer was wrong. \"There was no conscientious objection on behalf of the doctor that intervened in this case because there was no voluntary termination of the pregnancy, but (the miscarriage) was forced by the grave circumstances,\" he told the Ansa news agency. \"I rule out that a doctor could have told the family what they say he told them.\" Sources told Ansa that the doctor had not been registered as a \"conscientious objector\".

So we do not think the doctor was negligent,\" he said. It emerged earlier this year that the proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures. Italy is a predominantly Catholic country. But in southern Italy the proportion was even higher and in Sicily it was 87.6%.

Aston Villa defender Neil Taylor will also miss the match in Belgrade, potentially facing a three-match suspension following a challenge that resulted in Republic captain Seamus Coleman needing surgery for a fractured right leg.

It would mean more time for sport, but unions worry too many core curriculum subjects could dilute their importance. The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he wanted to look into how schools can increase levels of physical activity in children and young people. By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Although the need for more exercise is clear enough, it isn't just a simple matter of adding PE as a core subject. Pupils in Wales already have as core subjects Welsh, English, maths and sciences. They are the areas the government has decided should have most time and resources allocated to them. And teaching unions fear the more you add to that core, the less of a priority they each become. More than one-third are either overweight or obese, costing the Welsh NHS more than \u00a370m a year. The current core subjects in schools in Wales are English, Welsh (as a first language), mathematics, and science, while physical education is a foundation subject. Having PE elevated to a core part of the curriculum would mean more time devoted to it, as well as extra resources and more training for teachers. Schools would also need to give greater priority to provision for PE. As a result: \u2022 Teachers would be required to be competent to deliver the subject on completion of their initial teacher training. \u2022 Well qualified, specialist teachers would be needed to work with schools to ensure high-quality provision. \u2022 Standards and provision in physical education would be rigorously reviewed in school, both by the educational consortia and by schools inspectorate Estyn. \u2022 Progress would be regularly measured. The move to give PE more status in schools would be a bold move but an important one, according to the group. In its report, the group, which also included the chair of Sports Wales Laura McAllister, said: \"Given the Welsh government's commitment to making physical literacy as important a development skill as reading and writing, the group felt that changing the status of physical education is the only credible and secure way of ensuring this.\" But while teaching unions support the idea, they are worried that too many subjects on the core curriculum could dilute their importance. Dr Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, said it was important to decide on \"what small core we want\". \"We certainly want literacy and numeracy in there,\" he said. \"We may well want physical education in there too, that's for the government to decide.", "text_ai_base": "A committee led by Paralympic champion Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has proposed that Wales could be the first nation to elevate physical education (PE) to a core subject within its national curriculum. This shift would allow more time for sports in schools, but teaching unions express concerns that expanding the core curriculum might undermine the focus on existing subjects. The Welsh government has stated it will consider this recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews is keen to explore ways to boost physical activity among children and young people. Arwyn Jones, the BBC Wales education correspondent, notes that increasing exercise opportunities is essential, but simply adding PE to the core curriculum involves more complexity than it might seem. Currently, the core subjects in Wales are Welsh, English, mathematics, and science, which the government prioritizes with dedicated time and resources. Teaching unions worry that adding to the core could dilute each subject\u2019s priority. With over one-third of young people in Wales being overweight or obese, straining the NHS with costs exceeding \u00a370 million annually, promoting PE is increasingly vital. If PE becomes a core subject, schools would need to allocate more time, resources, and teacher training to it. Enhanced focus on PE would require teachers to demonstrate proficiency during initial training, bring qualified specialists into schools, and undergo rigorous assessment by educational consortia and Estyn, the schools inspectorate. Continuous monitoring of progress would also be necessary. Despite the boldness of this proposal, the group believes it's a crucial step. The report, which includes input from Sports Wales chair Laura McAllister, states that the Welsh government\u2019s commitment to physical literacy necessitates elevating PE's status as essential as reading and writing. However, while supportive, teaching unions caution against overcrowding the core curriculum. Dr. Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, emphasizes the need for a clear focus: \"We should decide on a small core. Literacy and numeracy are priorities; including PE may be wise, but it\u2019s ultimately the government\u2019s decision.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Lead member, Paralympic athlete Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, said Wales could be the first country where PE is a core subject.

Now scientists in Spain are trying to make that work easier by getting a computer to do it. The technology is being designed to automatically edit a whole game down to the key moments. The people behind it at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been working on it for a few years and have just published 18 pages of exactly how it works. Arnau Raventos is the lead professor on the project. He tells Newsbeat they have \"been working with the local television companies in Spain in order to try to make the job easier for the person who manually does the summaries currently.\" Without having to read the full report (we did that for you) - in short - it analyses what are known as key-frames. So, every part of the match is looked over by the computer to spot tell-tale signs of when something interesting is happening. That might be lots of players grouped together, lots of zoomed-in action, extra noise from the crowd or the sound of the referee's whistle. Arnau calls them \"occasions\". \"We want to find specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal is an occasion.\" We thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that. There is a long way to go though. The technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in. In a test on five matches, the technology detected 70 per cent of the total goals. \"We need to be sincere,\" says Arnau. \"We need to say that at the moment it's not possible to perform a complete automatic summary just yet. It's difficult to detect all the goals.\" \"However, we think it's very easy to discard those moments that are not important. For example, the panoramic views.

However, scientists in Spain are working to streamline this process by developing a computer capable of doing the task. This technology aims to automatically edit games by identifying crucial highlights. Researchers at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been developing this system for several years and have recently published an 18-page report detailing its mechanics. Arnau Raventos, the lead professor on the project, shared with Newsbeat that they are collaborating with local television companies in Spain to simplify the job for those who currently edit game summaries manually. Here\u2019s a brief overview of how it works: the system analyzes what are known as key-frames. The computer examines every segment of the match to detect indicators of significant events, such as clusters of players, zoomed-in action, heightened crowd noise, or the sound of the referee\u2019s whistle. Arnau refers to these instances as \"occasions.\" He explains, \"We aim to identify specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal qualifies as an occasion.\" For instance, suppose a defender falls in the penalty box\u2014everyone gathers, a whistle blows, faces fill the shot, and a penalty occurs. Theoretically, this technology should capture such moments. Nevertheless, the system is still in development, and even casual football fans might find its current limitations frustrating, as it hasn't yet consistently detected the exact moment a goal is scored. In trials across five matches, the technology identified 70% of the goals. \"We need to be honest,\" says Arnau. \"Currently, it's not feasible to create a fully automatic summary that catches every goal.\" Despite this, the technology effectively discards non-essential moments, like panoramic views, which simplifies the editor\u2019s task.

David Cameron has said it would be \"literally decades\" before Turkey was ready to join the EU. And he has said the UK has a veto over it happening, saying the agreement of every other EU member - as well as 28 national Parliaments - was necessary before a new country could join.

He said: \"With the terrorism threat that we face only growing, it is hard to see how it could possibly be in our security interests to open visa-free travel to 77 million Turkish citizens and to create a border-free zone from Iraq, Iran and Syria to the English Channel. \"It is even harder to see how such a course is wise when extremists everywhere will believe that the West is opening its borders to appease an Islamist government.\" Mr Gove said Turkey's \"democratic development\" had gone into \"reverse\" under President Erdogan. He added: \"We and the European Union should be protesting in the clearest and loudest possible manner at this erosion of fundamental democratic freedoms. \"But instead we and the European Union are making concession after concession to Erdogan.\" The prime minister has previously accused Leave campaigners of making \"a very misleading claim about Turkey\" and the EU.

Professor Leigh Sparks, who wrote the report, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was an imbalance in the type of food promoted in shops. \"If you look at the environment in store in retailing, then most of the promotions are pushing the products that are less healthy for consumers,\" he said. \"A lot of the products have been supersized as well - boxes of crisps, bags of crisps are good examples of that.\" He said that manufacturers needed to make changes to the composition of their products, while retailers should provide more information for consumers and change their \"balance of promotions\". \"I think retailers are increasingly aware of the issue and they're looking at what they can do,\" he added. \"But most of the voluntary schemes that have gone on so far have not had the impact because of this overwhelming tide in terms of unhealthy promotions as well.\" The report also backs the idea of a sugar tax. FSS senior dietary adviser Dr Gillian Purdon said: \"The report supports Food Standards Scotland views and recommendations for the need to extend sugar tax beyond soft drinks, to reformulate products to reduce sugar fat and salt, to resize portions, address less healthy food promotion and to provide clearer consumer information on products in both the retail and out of home sectors. \"This report will help us to develop new approaches to improve the balance of food offered and promoted by the retail sector. \"It is clear that a combination of measures will be needed overall to enable healthier eating. Regulation of promotions of high fat, salt and/or sugar food and drink within retail stores and out of home premises should be taken forward as a priority.\" Previous research by FSS indicated about 50% of less healthy food choices are purchased on promotions. For healthier foods, the figure is about 30%. The report added: \"We conclude that the current context for consumer choice in-store is affecting the health and diet of consumers in Scotland. \"Voluntary and self-regulatory approaches or relying on consumers to make 'good' decisions are not having sufficient impact.", "text_ai_base": "A report commissioned by Food Standards Scotland revealed that in-store promotions are skewed heavily towards foods high in salt or sugar. Academics from Stirling University, who authored the report, have advocated for a \"retail revolution\" to facilitate healthier consumer choices.

Food Standards Scotland (FSS) highlighted that Scottish obesity rates, now at 30%, could rise to 40% by 2030. Professor Leigh Sparks, the report's author, discussed the issue on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland, citing an imbalance in the types of foods promoted in stores. \"In retail environments, most promotions favor products that are less healthy for consumers,\" he said, noting the prevalence of supersized items like large boxes and bags of crisps. He suggested manufacturers should alter product compositions, while retailers need to offer better consumer information and adjust their promotional strategies. \"Retailers are increasingly aware of the issue and are exploring solutions,\" he added. \"However, voluntary schemes have yet to make a significant impact due to the dominance of unhealthy promotions.\" The report also supports the implementation of a sugar tax. FSS senior dietary adviser Dr. Gillian Purdon emphasized the report aligns with FSS's views on extending the sugar tax beyond soft drinks, reformulating products to lower sugar, fat, and salt, resizing portions, addressing unhealthy food promotion, and improving product information in both retail and dining establishments. \"This report will aid in developing methods to enhance the offering and promotion of healthier food by the retail sector,\" she stated. \"To foster healthier eating, a combination of measures is required. Regulation of promotions on high-fat, salt, and sugar food and drink in both stores and dining venues should be prioritized.\" Previous FSS research indicated that about 50% of purchases of less healthy foods are made during promotions, whereas the figure is roughly 30% for healthier options. The report concluded, \"The current setting for consumer choice in-store impacts the health and diet of Scottish consumers.

At least officially, he is not a citizen of the country he calls home. He was born and raised in Nepal and plays for the national team. He has an Indian father and a Nepali mother, so getting citizenship should not be a problem according to the law of the land. But his efforts to acquire Nepalese citizenship so far have been futile. \"It's been almost eight to nine years that I've been trying to get my citizenship. I'm still facing problems.

Bridging India's identity divide A life without identity Identity in pictures A game changer? Pakistan's identity management In Nepal, you can usually apply for citizenship at the age of 16 as long as your father or mother is able to sign the official document, according to the Nepali Citizenship Act of 2006. But in practice, women in this patriarchal society still face a lot of discrimination when passing down citizenship to their children, specially in the absence of the father or if the father is not a Nepali citizen. A lack of citizenship document can make your life tough - you cannot get a driving licence, open a bank account, pursue higher education or carry out legal transactions. And according to the United Nations, the number of people grappling with this problem is far from small. \"We estimate from the numbers we've seen that this is quite a big problem,\" says Robert Piper, the UN Resident Humanitarian Co-ordinator. \"In the Election Commission's findings, more than 2 million people they interviewed - people just from the villages, not the urban areas - were actually unable to show their citizenship documents,\" adds Mr Piper.

Bhagwati Chettri, 55, a Nepali, was abandoned by her husband several years ago.

However, cultural biases in Nepal often result in women facing significant hurdles when transferring citizenship to their children, especially if the father is absent or not a Nepali citizen. Without citizenship documents, individuals are barred from obtaining a driver's license, opening a bank account, pursuing higher education, or conducting legal transactions.

They aim to foster an environment of equality and diversity while educating teachers on the use of social media to indoctrinate young people into extremist ideologies. Hanif notes that the seminars will enhance understanding of radicalisation and extremism. He aims to help head teachers \"identify situations\" and address them properly without causing undue alarm. Young people often spend a significant amount of time online, where they may encounter extremist ideas without opposing viewpoints. These seminars will aid schools and parents, who often are unaware of their children's online activities, to recognize warning signs and appropriately address concerns. They will equip school leaders with counter-narratives against extremist propaganda. Hanif will be joined by Sara Khan, a counter-extremism campaigner and co-founder of the organization Inspire, as well as ASCL's parliamentary specialist, Anna Cole. Khan states that the seminars will clarify what is expected from schools under the law, as many misconceptions exist about the statutory requirements for schools and students. Cole emphasizes the importance of early intervention and risk assessments to prevent the criminalization of young people, advocating for an open culture where diverse views and ideas can be freely discussed.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) is introducing seminars in most major towns and cities in England to discuss new legislation and how schools and colleges should address radicalisation.

{"id": "xsum_39627689", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "During a visit to Birmingham on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn is expected to say a 17% increase in Carer's Allowance would help around one million people in the first year of a Labour government. Under the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from \u00a362.70 to \u00a373.10 a week. Ministers say they will spend an extra \u00a32bn on social care over three years. Carer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week. Eligible carers cannot earn more than \u00a3116 a week after tax. Mr Corbyn said he believed it \"would be a good thing to do\" to help carers, \"usually women\" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home. \"Caring for people is stressful,\" he told the BBC. \"In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.\" In his speech later, the Labour leader will claim \"Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting \u00a34.6bn from council care budgets\". \"Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,\" he will say. \"The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers \u00a3132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support. \"That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of \u00a310 a week. \"We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain. \"This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.\" According to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost \u00a3538m by 2020/21. This would be covered by scrapping the expected \u00a3650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth \u00a31m free of death duties. But the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance. Luke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \"Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do. \"That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional \u00a3450 a year for carers since 2010.", "text_ai_base": "Jeremy Corbyn is set to announce during his visit to Birmingham on Tuesday that a Labour government would increase Carer's Allowance by 17%, benefiting around one million people in its first year. This proposal aims to raise the weekly allowance from \u00a362.70 to \u00a373.10. The government plans an additional \u00a32 billion investment in social care over three years. Currently, Carer's Allowance supports about 6.5 million UK residents who care for elderly, disabled, or seriously ill friends or relatives for a minimum of 35 hours weekly, earning no more than \u00a3116 after tax. Mr. Corbyn views the increase as a means to assist carers, primarily women, who often resign from their jobs to care for elderly family members at home. He told the BBC that while caring can be rewarding, it shouldn't lead to financial hardship or isolation. In his upcoming speech, the Labour leader will blame \"Britain's social care crisis\" on Downing Street's \u00a34.6 billion cut to council care budgets, resulting in unpaid carers shouldering more responsibility. He will emphasize that the care provided by these carers saves taxpayers \u00a3132 billion annually, and that these often unrecognized heroes deserve not just praise, but essential financial support. Labour believes that a \u00a310 weekly boost to Carer's Allowance is both moral and economically sound. Corbyn advocates funding this increase by reversing the Conservative cut on inheritance tax, which only benefits Britain's wealthiest. He sees this move as a pivotal step toward modernizing the social care system and bolstering support for family carers. Labour estimates adjusting Carer's Allowance will cost \u00a3538 million by 2020/21, funded by canceling the anticipated \u00a3650 million inheritance tax cut for estates up to \u00a31 million passed between married couples without death duties. The Conservatives, however, argue Labour\u2019s promise to uplift the allowance is financially unfeasible. Luke Hall, a Conservative member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, acknowledges the significant societal contributions made by carers and asserts the current government\u2019s efforts, which have already increased Carer's Allowance by \u00a3450 annually since 2010.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Jeremy Corbyn will confirm on a visit to Birmingham on Tuesday that a Labour government would enhance Carer\u2019s Allowance by 17% to reach more than one million carers in the first year of payment.

Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks.

Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively.

Scientists propose that repairing or replacing some of these cells might mitigate long-term damage. In this study, an international team treated animals with heart attacks by applying a collagen patch soaked in a protein called Fstl1, which naturally occurs in healthy hearts but depletes in a key heart layer post-attack. Two weeks after application, the hearts developed new muscle cells and blood vessels, and showed improved pumping ability.

Those strong people make really good board members because they have strong views and they're not afraid to think differently than other people, which has served Facebook well.\" But one expert questioned whether the decision to keep on Mr Thiel - who was one of Facebook's early investors - was sustainable in the long-term. \"Facebook has always fundamentally seen itself as a technology company, but is now having to deal with the public position - and also the ethics and responsibilities - of being a publisher,\" media consultant Steve Hewlett told the BBC. \"Imagine that this person were sitting on the board of The Times or the BBC - that would look like an obvious conflict of interest.

Last week, the venture capitalist revealed to the New York Times that he had subsequently funded a team of lawyers to find and help \"victims\" of other Gawker articles sue the firm - an act he described as \"philanthropic\". One case resulted in a jury ordering Gawker to pay Hulk Hogan $140m (\u00c2\u00a397m) after it decided the publication of a sex tape featuring the ex-professional wrestler amounted to an invasion of privacy. Gawker is appealing against the ruling, which threatens its future.

There was also no deal granting India overland access across Bangladesh to its land-locked north-eastern states. But there was good news for tens of thousands of \"stateless border people\". The two countries agreed \"to put in motion\" a deal that allows about 50 Bangladeshi enclaves inside India to be integrated within Bangladesh and about 100 Indian areas inside Bangladesh to become part of India. Officials say that under the terms of a protocol between the two leaders - the details of which will be worked out at a later date - residents of these areas will have the right to decide whether they want to become Indians or Bangladeshis. BBC Bengali editor Sabir Mustafa says that the failure to reach agreement over sharing water from the Teesta river is a big setback for Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, who has staked much of her personal reputation on securing a deal. By Sabir Mustafa BBC Bengali editor There is little doubt that relations between the two countries are at their closest since the early 1970s when India helped Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan. But the warmth in relations is also serving to mask a growing unease in both countries about the nature of the relationship. There are worries that the Indian leadership may have invested all its goodwill in one political party in Bangladesh, namely the Awami League led by current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. As a result, whenever the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP comes to power, relations could take a nose dive. There is also concern in Bangladesh that Sheikh Hasina appears too eager to accommodate Indian demands. The visit lost much of its lustre when the Indian side made it clear at the last minute there would not be any agreement on the sharing of a major river. It has also taken some of the gloss off the first visit to Bangladesh by an Indian prime minister for 12 years. All the two sides could agree on this issue was a commitment to revisit it at a later date. Prime Minister Singh told reporters after the talks that \"substantial progress has been made on sharing water of common rivers\". He said further discussion was needed. It is widely thought that the deal fell through because of last-minute objections to it from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was reported to believe that India was in danger of supplying too much water to Bangladesh.", "text_ai_base": "The two countries were unable to sign an agreement on sharing river water due to objections from the chief minister of West Bengal, India.

However, this warmth is overshadowing a growing unease about the relationship's nature. Concerns exist that India's leadership might be aligning too closely with Bangladesh's Awami League, led by PM Sheikh Hasina.

BBC Bengali editor Sabir Mustafa says that the failure to reach an agreement on the sharing of water from the Teesta river is a blow to Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina, who put her political reputation on the line to get the agreement. \"The relations between the countries are now at their best since the early 1970s, when India helped Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan,\" Sabir Mustafa says. \"But that bonhomie is hiding growing discomfort over the contours of the new relationship. \"The concern is that the current Indian leadership might be building a relationship based more on an alliance with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League rather than the state of Bangladesh. \"If the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) comes to power or forms part of a coalition, as now seems likely, that could sour the relationship. \"There is also growing discomfort in Bangladesh over what is seen as Sheikh Hasina's undue willingness to accommodate Indian demands.\" Some of the gloss was taken off the visit - the first by a sitting Indian prime minister for 12 years - after India indicated at the last moment that a major agreement on sharing river water would not be reached. Instead, they agreed merely to look at the issue again in future. Mr Singh said after the talks that \"substantial progress has been made on the sharing of water of common rivers\" but that \"these issues will need to be pursued further\". Most analysts say the deal did not come off because of last-minute objections from the chief minister of the Indian state of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee.

Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.", "text_ai_base": "Kepler-452b orbits a star at a similar distance to Earth\u2019s orbit, although its radius is 60% larger than Earth\u2019s.

Lewes Crown Court heard that rather than having Asperger's syndrome he had an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that was undiagnosed for years. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Roderick Ley made the assessment after the stabbing. Mr Lock, a retired solicitor, was stabbed after crashing at about 16mph into the back of Mr Daley's car on the A24 in West Sussex on 16 July. He was forced to brake suddenly after Mr Daley made an emergency stop. The great-grandfather, who had recently been given the all-clear from prostate cancer, died at the scene. The trial has heard how Mr Daley, formerly of St Elmo Road, Worthing, had been suffering from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had \"pleaded\" with experts to section him. On Monday, Dr Ley told jurors: \"It's clear that the diagnosis of Asperger's was wrong. \"He has an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that was undiagnosed for many, many years.\" He said Mr Daley was not psychotic every moment of every day, and he would often \"downplay\" his symptoms. However, Dr Ley agreed that he exhibited \"narcissistic\", \"histrionic\" and \"self-centred\" traits, adding that it was unlikely he would ever have complete resolution of his illness. Another expert, consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph, said he was satisfied on all the evidence he had seen that Mr Daley was not psychotic at the time of the killing. Jurors also head from Mr Daley's father, who said his son had never been a violent person. John Daley described him as a \"nice guy\" who was affectionate to his family and animals. He said Mr Daley was \"scrupulously honest in all his dealings with others, honest to a fault in that he finds it difficult to lie about things\". He told the court that he first became worried about his son's mental health when he reported hearing voices. Mr Daley said he started a journal, partly to keep track of his son's treatment. \"The second reason for having the document was, as time went on, it was clear that Matthew's life expectations were draining away and I didn't want to be in my 80s and look back saying, 'What did I do'?\" The trial continues.", "text_ai_base": "Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but acknowledges attacking Donald Lock, 79, in Findon near Worthing last July, claiming diminished responsibility.

Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Roderick Ley assessed him after the incident. Mr. Lock, a retired solicitor, was stabbed after his car collided at approximately 16 mph with the rear of Daley's vehicle on the A24 in West Sussex on July 16. Daley had made an emergency stop, forcing Lock to brake suddenly. The great-grandfather, who had recently been declared free of prostate cancer, died at the scene. During the trial, it was disclosed that Daley, previously residing on St Elmo Road in Worthing, had suffered from mental health issues for a decade, with his family repeatedly urging experts to commit him for treatment. Dr. Ley informed jurors, \"The diagnosis of Asperger's was incorrect. He has a long-standing paranoid schizophrenic illness that went undiagnosed for years.\" Dr. Ley noted that Daley wasn't constantly psychotic and tended to \"downplay\" his symptoms. He also displayed \"narcissistic,\" \"histrionic,\" and \"self-centered\" traits, making full recovery unlikely. Another specialist, Dr. Philip Joseph, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that Daley was not psychotic at the time of the stabbing based on all the evidence. Jurors also heard from John Daley, Matthew's father, who described his son as a \"nice guy\" fond of his family and animals and someone \"scrupulously honest,\" struggling to lie. Concern about his son's mental health arose after Matthew began hearing voices, prompting John to start a journal to document his son's treatment and concerns for his future. \"I didn't want to look back in my 80s wondering, 'What did I do?'\" John stated.

The Police Federation of Northern Ireland ( PFNI) called described the move as \"astounding and very worrying\".

According to the department, there were 180,825 enrolments at FE colleges in 2013/14, but by 2015/16 that figure had fallen to 153,817. One of the six FE colleges, Belfast Metropolitan College (BMC), had a particularly steep decline in its enrolment in just one year. The number of enrolments at BMC alone fell from 36,685 in 2014/15 to 28,514 in 2015/16 - a decline of 22.3%. When approached to explain why this was the case, they declined to comment. NUS-USI President Fergal McFerran expressed alarm at the \"staggering drop\" and called on the executive to make a \"significant increase in the funding allocation for tertiary education and student financial support in the new budget\". The college with the lowest rate of decline was South Eastern Regional College where enrolments fell by 8.3% - from 35,832 in 2013/14 to 32,858 in 2015/16. FE colleges provide a range of courses for a range of learners including: Sources working in the FE sector told the BBC that the decline in enrolments could be down to a range of factors, including budget constraints leading to cuts to courses and staff. In 2015/16 over 400 staff in the FE sector were offered voluntary redundancy. Some also said that leisure, recreational and hobby courses - or non-regulated courses - had been reduced in recent years, leading to a drop in enrolments from life-long learners. The DfE figures indicate that there has been a consequent drop in the number of enrolments to non-regulated courses over the three years. In 2013/14 there were around 39,000 enrolments to recreational courses compared to around 24,500 in 2015/16.

Soon after the media picked up the case, President Ghani spoke with Jahangir and promised him that \"the case will be investigated properly and perpetrators will face justice\". The victim herself told the BBC: \"I want justice to save other women from such a fate.\" In the wake of the publicity, the Afghan government will be under pressure to investigate the incident properly and ensure some kind of resolution. But there are also hopes that the stand taken by Jahangir and his wife will embolden other victims of sexual crime, and have a lasting affect on how such cases are dealt with. Jahangir, a policeman, told the BBC eight men were arrested after the incident, but six have now been freed because of their political connections. He says he and his family had to flee to the capital, Kabul, fearing for their lives. He has threatened to kill himself unless that changes: \"If they are not put on trial, I'll have to commit suicide to escape the tensions I'm suffering from. There's no other way.\" Jahangir went public with the threat on Afghan television. He later met the country's interior ministry to press his case.

The concern reflects the view held by many - though by no means all - economists that leaving the EU would undermine the UK's economic performance. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU. There would be a period of uncertainty about access to the EU market for British exporters while new arrangements were negotiated. The ultimate result could be that it would be harder to sell to the EU market. It is argued that foreign investment could be hit by the uncertainty. This would be going on at a time when the UK has a large deficit in what is called \"the current account deficit\" - which is trade in goods and services plus some international financial transactions. The deficit has to be financed by loans and foreign investment in financial assets. Unease about the economic outlook could mean that foreign investors would only provide the finance for the deficit if sterling were cheaper. There is of course another view, reflected by Economists for Brexit that the UK would prosper outside the EU. For the short term however, it is more likely to be the majority view that moves markets and sterling in particular. Our reporting on the currency markets usually focuses on what's called the spot rates, the exchange rate that an investor pays to buy currency immediately. But they can also buy options, which are rights to buy or sell a currency (or other types of financial asset) in the future at a price fixed in advance. It's a way of getting insurance against a move in the exchange rate. If the move you are worried about doesn't happen you don't exercise the option.

Additionally, foreign investment may suffer due to this uncertainty, worsening the situation as the UK faces a large current account deficit, which encompasses trade in goods and services along with some international financial transactions. This deficit requires financing through loans and foreign investment in financial assets, and apprehensions about economic prospects might lead foreign investors to demand lower sterling prices to finance the deficit.

Cavendish, 31, began his campaign with a hard-fought sixth-placed finish in the scratch race, after Denmark's Lasse Norman Hansen, the London 2012 Olympic champion and Roger Kluge took the top two spots by gaining a lap on the field. In the individual pursuit, Cavendish recorded a time of four minutes 16.878 seconds and caught reigning world champion Colombian Fernando Gaviria Rendon in the process. That temporarily gave the Manxman the outright lead, before Hansen set a new Olympic record of 4:14:982, beating Sir Bradley Wiggins' time set in 2008, to win his second event in a row. However, Hansen dropped from first to sixth overall after he was the first rider to fall out of the elimination race which sees the rider in last position at the end of every second lap ejected from the race. Cavendish was looking comfortable as other riders dropped out but he was ejected, despite not being the last rider over the line, when he overtook a rider while off the inside of the track, and was awarded seventh place.

Wales' James won a silver medal in the keirin on Saturday and maintained her good form on Sunday as she set a new Olympic record during the sprint qualification. James recorded a time of 10.721 seconds to beat the 10.724 set by fellow Briton Victoria Pendleton at the 2012 Olympics in London. That saw James become the fastest qualifier and she comfortably beat Olga Ismayilova of Azerbaijan by a margin of 0.165 secs to move into the quarter-finals, which take place from 14:00 BST on Monday.

The fact is the campaign has become a succession of tightly controlled photo opportunities... by all the main parties. This has become the hi-vis, hard hat election. It's been the predictable campaign gear for both David Cameron and George Osborne. No walkabouts. No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters. But there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support. Election hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election. Magazine Monitor: Where did the word 'hustings' come from? There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity. I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal. Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans. They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the \"noise\" of national campaigning. That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities. On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South. There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools. But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university? The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years. It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students. One angry voice in the audience shouted: \"That's outrageous and disgraceful\". It got backing from the Greens. \"That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market,\" said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley. There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff. A precise solution perhaps required a precise response. But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one. \"It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party,\" she told the questioner. And Labour's Dame Margaret? \"We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating.", "text_ai_base": "At the heart of the media's frustration lies the tightly controlled nature of modern political campaigns, dominated by carefully staged photo opportunities from all major parties. This election season could be dubbed the \"hi-vis, hard hat campaign,\" particularly for figures like David Cameron and George Osborne, who have avoided spontaneous interactions with the public to prevent unexpected challenges from voters. Yet, there is an intriguing aspect of this election that offers a glimpse of authentic, unfiltered politics: the election hustings. These events have been a notable success this general election season. The origin of the term 'hustings' piques curiosity, and according to research by a Christian charity, a record number of these events have been hosted in churches. Having attended several hustings, I can attest that their effectiveness stems from the direct and often personal nature of the debates. Voters actively engage politicians, cutting through campaign sound bites to address overlooked issues. This dynamic was evident at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ Church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience largely consisted of African Caribbean community members. Politicians from all parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, present to defend her 6,000-vote Labour majority, fielded questions on immigration, Europe, and education. One question, however, resonated deeply: Why are African Caribbean graduates three times more likely to be unemployed six months post-graduation? Research by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, involving 2,500 students over two years, revealed the disparity in opportunities offered to black students versus their white counterparts. An outraged audience member declared, \"That's outrageous and disgraceful,\" drawing support from the Green Party. Green candidate John Devine, seeking election in Derbyshire's Amber Valley, responded, \"That indicates some form of discrimination in the job market.\" There was a call for employers to be legally required to audit their hiring practices. This complex issue required a nuanced response, yet Evonne Williams, the Conservative candidate for Derby South, carefully avoided commitment, saying, \"It's something we haven't considered, but I'm happy to take it back to the party.\" As for Labour's Dame Margaret, she promised to review the Equalities Act to determine if it requires modernization and updates.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Campaigns nowadays tightly controlled, every major party only puts on staged photo\u2011ops, therefore the media\u2019s frustration is clear.

Study by the Bow Group think\u2011tank and Elevation Networks, which followed 2,500 students for two years, showed black students get far fewer chances than white peers; therefore the gap is obvious.

His experience tallies with that of French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, who described being backed up against the metal door, and getting no response to passengers' desperate calls for help. The drama unfolded on board a high-speed train travelling from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday. Mr Robinson realised something was wrong shortly after the Thalys train went through Brussels. He saw three members of the train's staff run through his coach, carriage 11, which was the next compartment along from carriage 12, where the gunman emerged. \"They said nothing. They were a man followed by two women,\" he says. \"They looked scared, they didn't alert us to anything, they ran to the end of my carriage and used their key to open a service door. Then they locked the door after them.\" Carriage 11 was in the front half of the train and the locked door allowed staff access to a service area, which was off limits to passengers. Then other people started running through from carriage 12. Some were covered in blood, others said they had seen a man with a gun shooting people. \"There we were, with nowhere to go. There were probably 20 to 30 of of us, including the French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade and his family. We didn't know anything.\" Anglade, who injured his hand as he tried to activate the train's alarm, has also spoken about members of train staff locking themselves in a private cabin, complaining that they could have led passengers to a luggage area in another part of the train. He told Paris Match (in French) \"We shouted for the staff to let us in, we yelled 'open!' There was no response.\" Agnes Ogier, the boss of Thalys, has said there will be an internal investigation and the staff involved will be asked to \"explain their behaviour during this dramatic event\". Jamie Robinson says after 10 terrifying minutes a man entered their carriage and explained there had been a man with a gun but the situation was now under control. Afterwards he learned this was Anthony Sadler, one of the American passengers who helped overpower the attacker. \"The relief just exploded. We were all in such painful shock,\" he recalls. After learning they were safe Jamie Robinson and other passengers in his coach remained where they were, in numb silence, until they reached Arras station where the suspect, Ayoub El-Khazzani, a 25-year-old Moroccan, was arrested.", "text_ai_base": "Jamie Robinson, a medical researcher, shared with the BBC's World Have Your Say programme that train staff abandoned passengers by locking themselves in a service room.

The incident took place on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris on a Friday. Mr. Robinson noticed trouble right after the Thalys train passed through Brussels, observing three train staff members hurrying through his coach, carriage 11, adjacent to carriage 12, where the gunman appeared. \"They said nothing. A man was followed by two women,\" he recalls. \"They seemed frightened, did not alert us, ran to the end of my carriage, opened a service door, and locked it behind them.\" Carriage 11 was at the front of the train, and the locked door led to an area off-limits to passengers.

Some of Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric cast doubt over long-standing US alliances, including with Japan. The meeting was Mr Trump's first face-to-face with a world leader since winning the presidential election. The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy. The president-elect has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr Abe strenuously supports as a means of countering China's growing economic strength. The deal was approved by the Japanese parliament, despite the likelihood that it would be cancelled when Mr Trump takes office. Mr Trump has also said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil, and has floated the idea that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korean missiles. The meeting was reportedly arranged when Mr Abe rang the president-elect to congratulate him, mentioning that he would be passing through New York on the way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Abe said: \"We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time. We held it in a very warm atmosphere. \"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations the alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence.\" The Japanese leader gave few details of the meeting but added the two agreed to meet again for deeper talks on a wider range of issues. Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who have emerged as key advisers to Mr Trump since his surprise election victory, also met Mr Abe at Trump Tower.

Climbers need to cross the glacier, including the treacherous Khumbu Icefall, to climb the mighty peak. The accelerated meltdown of glaciers in the region is causing concern against a backdrop of rising global temperatures. Scientists say the warning is the first of its kind for Khumbu, although other glaciers in the Himalayas have seen an increase in the number of lakes formed. Such newly formed glacial lakes can overflow causing flooding, and with it loss of life and damage downstream. This is the first scientific team to visit the region after the devastating earthquake last April. \"A decade or so ago, there were individual ponds on the Khumbu glacier but in the past five years or so they have begun to get larger and join up,\" said Ann Rowan, who led the field study team from the universities of Sheffield and Leeds. Dr Rowan's team has been studying the behaviour of debris-covered glaciers, focusing on Khumbu. \"Particularly, on the left hand side of the lower reaches of the glacier, there is a series of about seven or eight large ponds that are now starting to link and form a big chain,\" she told the BBC. \"There is water flowing from the upper part of the glacier through the series of these ponds and that is going to encourage them to join up. \"At present, the glacier appears to be disintegrating, and may form a few large and potentially hazardous lakes on the glacier surface.\" Dr Rowan's team has studied satellite images of the Khumbu glacier dating back 15 years and has also conducted three ground surveys since 2009. The scientists found that parts of the lower region of the debris-covered glacier have been shrinking because of loss of ice underneath. This has allowed the formation and expansion of water bodies. The study says measurements for the past 15 years show that the surface of the debris-covered glacier has been declining at the rate of two metres per year. Unlike the usually smooth-iced glaciers elsewhere, many in the Himalayan region are debris covered, meaning they are coated by a layer of sand, gravel and rock. Scientists say since the upper parts of many Himalayan glaciers are losing ice mass due to rising temperatures. The supply of ice to the lower part of the glacier is therefore decreasing, causing the shrinkage.", "text_ai_base": "Ponds on the surface of the Khumbu Glacier in the Himalayas have expanded and merged into larger bodies of water.

But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before? William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season. The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time.

But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House. \"The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,\" Mr Seale said. \"It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school.

Immigration minister James Brokenshire said he hoped the DFT system would resume within weeks. It is thought about 800 applicants are affected - and can now seek bail. Of those, it is estimated that about 100 may have to be released. The system, introduced in 2000, accelerates legal hearings and appeals while keeping the individual detained. It is used in cases which officials believe can be decided quickly. Last month the Court of Appeal ordered the Home Office to halt the system immediately after an earlier High Court hearing concluded it contained \"structural unfairness\". High Court judge Mr Justice Nicol put a \"legal stay\" - a temporary delay - on his ruling on 12 June, following a case brought by campaign group Detention Action. This meant the fast-track system remained in operation until the government had exhausted all opportunities to appeal. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said officials were worried their procedures were not as robust as they should be. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the system had \"come under significant legal challenge\". \"Risks surrounding the safeguards within the system for particularly vulnerable applicants have also been identified to the extent that we cannot be certain of the level of risk of unfairness to certain vulnerable applicants who may enter DFT. \"In light of these issues, I have decided to temporarily suspend the operation of the detained fast-track policy. \"I hope this pause to be short in duration, perhaps only a matter of weeks, but I will only resume operation of this policy when I am sure the right structures are in place to minimise any risk of unfairness.\" The decision to suspend the process means those asylum seekers detained and awaiting hearings will be reassessed at a \"senior level\" to see if they can be released from detention to continue their asylum application in the normal way. Mr Brokenshire added: \"Those who meet the general criteria for detention will not be directly affected by the decision to suspend DFT. \"Many are already detained under these powers, for example because they are at risk of absconding and face imminent removal. \"Only if detention can no longer be justified outside a DFT process will applicants be released to continue their asylum claim in the regular asylum system.\" He said applicants who face removal to a safe third country, pose a risk to the public or are foreign offenders are \"still liable to be detained or remain detained\".

The late New York governor Mario Cuomo said \u201cYou campaign in poetry. You govern in prose\u201d. In Scotland the 2014 campaign for freedom which never quite dared to speak its name, was conducted mostly in prose. Pure utility\u2014what the late Professor Sir Neil McCormick called \u201cutilitarian nationalism\u201d\u2014that is, a drive to independence based on the proposition that this condition was most likely to make Scotland more prosperous. The independence battle was not fought to honour those who fought at Stirling Bridge or Bannockburn nor to revenge those who lost at Flodden or Culloden, but to improve the lot of the people of Scotland. In the event, Yes lost. In the wet, muddy flood golden early morn of autumn 2014, Scotland woke and saw that it wasn\u2019t happening. There was a definite, not overwhelming vote to stay in the Union, as against leaving. The final percentage split was Yes (to independence) 44.7%. No 55.3%. Why? To some people amongst \u201cthe 45\u201d as the defeated side quickly mythologised itself, there was \u2013 or had to have been \u2013 some betrayal, a conspiracy of substantial effort and money, weighted with political \u201cEstablishment\u201d gravity and the might of the British security apparatus, to strong-arm a credulous population into voting to stay. The message was negative, reinforced by a mostly hostile press, they insist. But in truth, many of those who voted No, to stay in the Union, appeared to feel rather positive about the Union. Some, many even, were sentimental and downright emotional about it. Some felt pained, even embarrassed and rocked by the idea of ending a three-century relationship. When asked, the Union partisans often said they would miss it if it was gone.", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 83, "wordsSpent": 807, "remainingCredits": 105040, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Medium", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

On Thursday morning, the Daily Mail devoted an entire page to an editorial taking umbrage, to put it mildly, with a Guardian cartoon suggesting the attacker at Finsbury Park mosque may have been indoctrinated by reading that paper and The Sun. I tweeted about that battle here. But the issue that most interests me is that Facebook and Google have been getting it in the neck for not doing more to remove far-right material online glorifying the attack. In recent months, political pressure has mounted on these two tech giants, as well as other smaller firms, to ensure that the internet is not a \"safe space\" for terrorists. That old political instinct that Something Must Be Done has kicked into overdrive. At a recent press conference, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron committed not only to working together on this issue, but introducing fines if companies didn't act faster to remove hateful material. It is interesting that this political pressure has been re-applied in the light of an attack by a white man on Muslims. It suggests that the scope of material on the web that could meet with popular disapproval is vast. Will an anti-Semitic attack prompt demands that Facebook and Google act on anti-Semitism? Could a rise in sectarian hatred in India prompt demands in that country for, say, Hindu nationalist content to be removed? Perhaps so. Which means this is a good time to remind you of the complexity of this issue and why, though I certainly don't instinctively take the side of the most powerful companies in the world, it's important to be clear about the implications of turning our Something Must Be Done ire against them. First of all, we have to separate the issue of encryption from the broader one about hateful content. At times, leading British politicians haven't seemed to grasp the difference. Messaging apps like WhatsApp are attractive to terrorists because they are protected at both ends: security services can't easily infiltrate them. But if you undermine that protection by creating a so-called back door to encryption, that is an invitation to all sorts of nasties - from foreign powers to cyber-criminals - to take advantage. On the issue of what to do about hateful material, the problems with clamping down on it are several, and both practical and philosophical. Practically speaking, the sheer volume of content is impossible to manage, probably even with Artificial Intelligence.", "text_ai_base": "To illustrate, someone on Twitter commented on The Times's front page, noting: \"He's white, so let's highlight that he's jobless, a lone wolf, and has mental health issues.\" The Times was far from the only publication facing such criticism.

The political instinct that Something Must Be Done has surged dramatically.

This pressure has re-emerged following an attack by a white man on Muslims, suggesting a broad scope of web content could face disapproval. Will an anti-Semitic attack lead to demands for Facebook and Google to address anti-Semitism? Could rising sectarian tensions in India lead to calls for the removal of Hindu nationalist content? Possibly. It's crucial to grasp the complexity of this issue and consider the consequences of directing our demands for action toward these powerful companies. First, we must distinguish between the issue of encryption and the broader one of hateful content\u2014a distinction some British politicians have overlooked. Messaging apps like WhatsApp appeal to terrorists because they offer end-to-end encryption, making infiltration by security services difficult.

Republican voters may be \"idiots\", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population \"swing\" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. \"The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy,\" he writes. \"Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations.\" Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. \"We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win,\" Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. \"Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan.", "text_ai_base": "The Republican Party is deeply divided. The rhetoric from its members is often too inflammatory. While some might claim Republican voters are \"idiots,\" the general public tends to be more discerning. The US electoral map favors candidates who win key high-population \"swing\" states, making it challenging for Republicans. Consider this: a recent survey of three critical swing states\u2014Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\u2014shows a virtual tie between the two prospective nominees. These states, which hold a combined 67 electoral votes, supported Democrat Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. If added to the states Mitt Romney won in 2012, the total rises to 273 electoral votes\u2014three more than needed to secure the presidency. Furthermore, a national tracking poll released on Wednesday shows Donald Trump closing in on Hillary Clinton, causing significant concern among Democrats. However, more rational voices point to the fact that the Reuters/Ipsos national poll, showing Clinton at 41% versus Trump\u2019s 40% with 19% undecided, was conducted online. The Quinnipiac swing-state poll also heavily sampled white voters, who tend to lean Republican, suggesting that Trump's support might not be growing as much as it appears. Election analyst Nate Silver cautions against jumping to conclusions based on these polls, reminding us that the election will have many ups and downs, and polls can be unpredictable. Although political analysts obsess over every poll, the indication that Trump is competitive with Clinton should question early predictions of a landslide for the Democrats. Trump has a path to the presidency. While it's improbable, it exists. This potential path hinges on the Rust Belt\u2014states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, with its rapidly expanding Hispanic population, sides with Clinton, Trump could win if he takes those states.

Mr Bayrou has run three times for president, winning more than 18% of the vote in the 2007 election.

Ms Le Pen, he said, posed a \"major and immediate threat for our country and Europe\".

Jones said he was going up to Murrayfield to set the tone and leave with the win. He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games. The tactics were more route one, using the forwards. Centre Jonathan Joseph didn't really get the ball and the wingers mainly got it from kick returns so there is still a bit of finesse for England to put around the back line. The stats showed that England's set-piece was very good. Captain Dylan Hartley's line-outs were brilliant (England only lost one of their 15) and they were clinical. Jones has said he wants a strong set-piece game and he wants a strong, abrasive pack. They delivered that against Scotland. England also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them. From that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more. Media playback is not supported on this device His centre partner Owen Farrell wasn't in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn't his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time. I am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball. Farrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try. I would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England. I would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, \"I need to be in the game more\". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that. Henry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt.

However, Centre Jonathan Joseph rarely received the ball, and the wingers mainly handled it from kick returns, indicating England still needs to refine their backline strategy. Statistically, England's set-piece performance was excellent. Captain Dylan Hartley's line-out execution was nearly perfect, with only one miss out of 15 attempts. Jones's vision of a robust set-piece game and an abrasive pack came to fruition against Scotland. England also capitalized on both clear-cut opportunities to score tries, which is promising, though Joseph likely wants more involvement. Media playback isn't supported on this device. Owen Farrell, his center partner, also wasn't prominent, and full-back Mike Brown didn\u2019t perform as expected. Improvement will come with time. I'm not entirely convinced by the pairing of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside center. When two specialized number 10s split their focus on game organization, they don't engage enough directly; Farrell carried the ball only three times and Joseph four against Scotland. This shows the midfield isn't operating at full potential, although their combination did lead to Jack Nowell's try. Ideally, an inside center capable of both playmaking and posing an individual threat would suit better than having a fly-half in that role temporarily. A player eager to be more involved, like Henry Slade\u2014though currently injured\u2014would be perfect.

The 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph. It revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith. Pembrokeshire council said \"it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice\". Smith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012. During that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings. Allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home. The report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith \"displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time\". Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy. He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child. He also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children. The report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer. The fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application. The report said the head of service had \"replied in very positive terms\". A formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to \"highlight any concerns\" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes. The head of service left the section blank. It was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined. The panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer. \"By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action,\" the report said. \"It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005\" and \"only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer\".", "text_ai_base": "An investigation into Pembrokeshire council's interactions with Michael Smith reveals that his foster carer application was halted merely by chance.

Smith, based in Haverfordwest, worked as a youth employee for the council from May 2001 to January 2012 and faced three disciplinary hearings during his tenure. Allegations included allowing a child to sit on and drive his Land Rover, letting a child ride without a seatbelt, and hosting at his home a young person reported missing by their foster carer. The report, created by an independent social worker, indicated that Smith exhibited numerous grooming behaviors while employed by Pembrokeshire council, although no direct abuse allegations surfaced during that period. Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct, and in September 2013, police launched an investigation following accusations of sexually abusing a boy. In July 2014, Smith was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a child under 13, inciting sexual activity, and taking indecent photographs. He also admitted to possessing 1,136 indecent images of children. In 2010, Smith applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer. The fostering team sought the Head of Youth Service\u2019s input on his application. The report noted that the head responded \"very positively.\" A reference form sent to the head asked to \"highlight any concerns\" with Smith's employment, including disciplinary proceedings and their outcomes. The head left this section blank. It wasn\u2019t until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that a member remembered Smith had been previously investigated for inappropriate behavior and disciplined. This recollection led the panel to deem Smith unsuitable for foster care approval. The report noted that by omitting crucial information, the panel might have mistakenly believed there were no concerns or disciplinary actions against Smith. It was only by chance that a panel member recalled the 2005 safeguarding investigation, preventing Smith from becoming a foster carer.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Examining Pembrokeshire council\u2019s dealings with Michael Smith \u2014 his foster\u2011carer request?

Jung is the second winner of the Grand Slam, emulating Pippa Funnell in 2003. \"I think we need a bit of time to realise this very special moment. It's a very big situation,\" he said. Zara Tindall achieved the Olympic qualification mark on her way to a 23rd-place finish aboard High Kingdom, the horse that took the Queen's granddaughter to team silver at London 2012. Team GB places will not be announced until July but Tattersall has hit the qualifying standard, alongside Tindall, Kristina Cook (seventh on Star Witness), Izzy Taylor (eighth on Allercombe Ellie) and Ben Way, who came 12th on Galley Light. Jung led after each discipline - dressage, cross country and showjumping - and finished with 34.4 penalty points, a record low at Badminton Park. Ostholt was on 43.4 and Tattersall had 44.6. Tattersall - who had previously finished no higher than 16th at Badminton - made a firm case for Olympic selection. She flawlessly cleared all 13 obstacles in the showjumping finale, as did Ostholt and Jung, ensuring the places stayed the same as at the end of Saturday's cross country. Such was Jung's lead, he could afford to knock down two poles on his final run but sailed through unblemished to earn a standing ovation from a sell-out crowd.

It means the firm has far greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe. Clustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google\u2019s \u201ccaptain of moonshots\u201d, Astro Teller, told reporters. \"We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,\u201d he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously. \u201cReal users\u201d will be able to use the system in the \u201ccoming months\u201d, he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place. Rural ambition Google\u2019s aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas. Rather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons. The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction. By using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time. Last last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months. Spin off Over the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas. Last month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work. Mr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more \u201cmature\u201d moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in \u201cno rush\u201d to make Project Loon a stand-alone business. \u201cThe service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,\u201d he said. \"Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go. That has made the prospects of Loon even better than we had anticipated.\u201d Falling out of the sky One key hurdle for the company to overcome is the reliability of its balloons. To date, the record for continuous balloon flight has been 190 days.", "text_ai_base": "The Project Loon team, part of the company's X research lab, announced advancements in machine learning that allow them to predict weather patterns. This leap means the firm can better control the paths of its balloons, enabling them to target specific regions instead of navigating the globe. By clustering fewer balloons, the project becomes more cost-effective, as Google's head of ambitious projects, Astro Teller, explained. \"We can now experiment and provide service to a specific area with around ten, twenty, or thirty balloons,\" he noted, rather than needing hundreds. Teller mentioned that \"real users\" could start accessing the system in the \"coming months,\" although he didn't disclose where the initial rollout would occur. Google aims to connect the nearly four billion people worldwide who currently lack internet access, especially in remote rural areas. Rather than building extensive infrastructure to mirror the connectivity of the developed world, the company is testing a method of delivering internet from large, tennis-court-sized balloons in the stratosphere, about 11 miles up. The balloons can change direction by adjusting altitude to ride different weather streams. Utilizing machine-learning algorithms, Google believes they have found a way to predict weather conditions with enough precision to keep balloons stationary over a small area for extended periods. Last year, they successfully maintained a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months. Over the past year, Google has faced increasing pressure from shareholders to reduce spending on its more extravagant projects. Recently, the company spun off its self-driving project into a new company, Waymo, and increased efforts to commercialize the technology amid criticism of its slow profitability. Mr. Teller remarked that Project Loon is one of the company's more \"mature\" ambitious projects. While they are working on agreements with telecom firms, Google is in \"no rush\" to make Project Loon an independent business. \"The service has a much better chance of being profitable, which excites us,\" he said. \"Things have gone much better than we thought possible, improving Loon's prospects.\" However, a significant challenge remains: the reliability of the balloons.

As Mats Hummels told BBC Scotland afterwards, this was not Germany back to their all-conquering best, but at times against a very good Poland side, they came very close. This was particularly true of the offensive aspect of their play. They swarmed forward, time after time, their incisive passing opening up gaps in the Poland defence. After 20 minutes in the Commerzbank Arena, they had battered the Poles seemingly into submission and the 2-0 scoreline at that point looked like it might become five or six by the end. Thomas Muller, scorer of the first goal, was one of several Germany players on song in that opening period, his languid style belying a sharpness and intelligence that more often than not leads him to be in the right place at the right time in the opposition's box. In Karim Bellarabi, the Bayer Leverkusen winger, Germany appear to have added yet another attacking weapon to their already considerable arsenal. Given his international debut in the defeat by Poland last year, he has become a regular in Joachim Low's line-up and on Friday night showed why. Linking on the left with another relative newcomer - the Cologne full-back Jonas Hector - he gave Lukasz Piszczek, the experienced Borussia Dortmund defender, the run-around, creating Muller's goal and causing havoc. Alan Hutton, or whoever is given the nod by Gordon Strachan at right back, will require support from players in front of and beside him if Germany are not to run amok. Much has been made of the lack of playing time some of Scotland's starters against Georgia had under their belts for their clubs. In the German ranks, a similar issue seemed not to affect Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Gotze. The midfielder has started just two of Manchester United's six competitive matches this season, with Gotze starting just once in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich. Yet both men played significant roles in overcoming Poland. Gotze - nominally playing as a striker - drifted to find space, allowing Muller to fill the gaps left behind. He scored twice - the first a finish from the edge of the box after dancing past Polish defenders on the left of the penalty area - and also struck the post as he sought to reward Low's loyalty in the face of Pep Guardiola's continuing quandary about how best to accommodate him at Bayern.", "text_ai_base": "Germany's uninspiring performance in Tbilisi was concerning, but the match in Frankfurt following their 1-0 victory over Georgia compounded worries about Monday\u2019s potential outcome. According to Mats Hummels' comments to BBC Scotland, Germany hadn't returned to their peak form yet, but against a strong Polish team, they came close. This was especially evident in their attacking play. Germany relentlessly pressed forward, their sharp passes exposing weaknesses in Poland's defense. Within 20 minutes at the Commerzbank Arena, Germany seemed to have overwhelmed the Poles, making the 2-0 lead appear as if it could easily multiply to five or six by game\u2019s end. Thomas Muller, who scored the opening goal, was in fine form during this period, his seemingly laid-back approach masking a keen intelligence that consistently finds him in the right positions in the opponent's box. With Karim Bellarabi, the Bayer Leverkusen winger, Germany has found yet another attacking asset. Despite his national debut during a loss to Poland last year, he has since become a regular in Joachim Low's lineup, proving his worth on Friday night. Teaming up on the left with another new addition, Cologne full-back Jonas Hector, Bellarabi outmaneuvered Lukasz Piszczek, the seasoned Borussia Dortmund defender, contributing to Muller\u2019s goal and creating chaos in the process. This implies that whoever Gordon Strachan chooses at right back, possibly Alan Hutton, will need support to prevent Germany from dominating. Concerns over some of Scotland\u2019s starters lacking club playtime were noted, but similar issues didn't hinder Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Gotze. Schweinsteiger had only started two of Manchester United\u2019s six competitive matches this season, while Gotze started just once in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich. Nevertheless, both were pivotal in Germany's victory over Poland. Playing as a striker at times, Gotze moved to find space, allowing Muller to exploit openings. He scored twice\u2014once from the edge of the box after skilfully evading Polish defenders\u2014and even hit the post, demonstrating why Low steadfastly supports him despite Pep Guardiola\u2019s ongoing dilemma about his role at Bayern.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "If that showing in Tbilisi worried, then the subsequent fixture Germany played after their 1-0 win over Georgia added to the anxiety about what might be in store on Monday. \"We are not at the top again,\" Germany central defender Mats Hummels warned BBC Scotland in March. They might not have hit top gear on Friday against a very good Poland team, but there were moments when Germany threatened to get close, particularly in the final third. Time and again they surged forward with crisp passing that continually cut the Poles open like a knife through butter. It seemed no exaggeration after 20 minutes in the Commerzbank Arena to think of Germany as a team that would put Poland firmly in their place with the 2-0 lead they had racked up looking like it could double to four or five by full time. Thomas Muller, scorer of the first goal, was among a cast of players who were purring at that stage. With his laconic gait, wide-eyed style and upright running, the forward can appear almost nonchalant in the manner in which he goes about his work. It could not be further from the truth. No other German player is as wily, cunning or smart when it comes to making runs to arrive in the right place in their opponents' penalty area. In Karim Bellarabi, the Bayer Leverkusen wide man, Germany have found another string to their attacking bow. He may have made his international debut last year in a shock defeat by Poland, but has been a feature since in the Joachim Low's selections, and showed his quality on Friday. The 25-year-old, dovetailing down the left flank with another recent recruit in Cologne full-back Jonas Hector, got the better of Poland's venerable Borussia Dortmund defender Lukasz Piszczek, complicating the build up to Muller's goal.

{"id": "xsum_30414955", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "This is demonstrably false. Far-right parties failed to pass a 5% barrier to enter parliament, although if they had banded together, and not split their vote, they would have probably slipped past the threshold. Only one government minister has links to nationalist parties - though he is in no way a neo-Nazi or fascist. And the speaker of parliament, Volodymyr Groysman, is Jewish. He has the third most powerful position in the country after the president and prime minister. But Ukrainian officials and many in the media err to the other extreme. They claim that Ukrainian politics are completely fascist-free. This, too, is plain wrong. As a result, the question of the presence of the far-right in Ukraine remains a highly sensitive issue, one which top officials and the media shy away from. No-one wants to provide fuel to the Russian propaganda machine. But this blanket denial also has its dangers, since it allows the ultra-nationalists to fly under the radar. Many Ukrainians are unaware that they exist, or even what a neo-Nazi or fascist actually is, or what they stand for. This hyper-sensitivity and stonewalling were on full display after President Petro Poroshenko presented a Ukrainian passport to someone who, according to human rights activists, is a \"Belarusian neo-Nazi\". The Ukrainian leader handed out medals on 5 December to fighters who had tenaciously defended the main airport in the eastern region of Donetsk from being taken over by Russian-backed separatists. Among the recipients was Serhiy Korotkykh, a Belarusian national, to whom Mr Poroshenko awarded Ukrainian citizenship, praising his \"courageous and selfless service\". The president's website showed a photo of Mr Poroshenko patting the shoulder of the Belarusian, who was clad in military fatigues. Experts who follow the far right have strongly objected to President Poroshenko's decision. They say Mr Korotkykh was a member of the far-right Russian National Unity party and also a founding member of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS) in Russia. According to Ukrainian academic Anton Shekhovtsov, the NSS's main goal \"is to prepare for a race war\". Mr Shekhovtsov said the Belarusian had been charged for involvement in a bombing in central Moscow in 2007, and was detained in 2013 in the Belarusian capital Minsk for allegedly stabbing an anti-fascist activist. He was later released for lack of evidence. Even though the details involved accusations rather than facts, if true they were damning, said human rights activist Halya Coynash. Top Ukrainian officials then rejected as defamatory any claims that Mr Korotkykh had neo-Nazi ties. \"Counter-intelligence has no information that could prevent him from receiving Ukrainian citizenship,\" said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security services.", "text_ai_base": "The claim that Ukraine is free of far-right influence is clearly incorrect. While far-right parties did not manage to surpass the 5% threshold required for parliamentary entry, they might have succeeded if their votes hadn't been fragmented. Presently, only one government minister has connections to nationalist parties, yet he is neither a neo-Nazi nor a fascist. Furthermore, Volodymyr Groysman, the Jewish speaker of parliament, holds the country's third highest-ranking position. Despite these facts, Ukrainian officials and much of the media often claim politics in Ukraine are entirely devoid of fascism\u2014another misconception. Consequently, the issue of far-right presence in Ukraine remains sensitive, with officials and media avoiding the topic to prevent giving Russian propaganda any leverage. However, ignoring the problem can be risky, as it allows ultra-nationalists to operate unnoticed and leaves many Ukrainians unaware of what neo-Nazis or fascists believe. This sensitivity was evident when President Petro Poroshenko granted Ukrainian citizenship to an individual accused of being a \"Belarusian neo-Nazi\" by human rights activists. On December 5th, Poroshenko awarded medals to those who defended the Donetsk airport from Russian-backed forces, including Serhiy Korotkykh, whom he praised for his \"courageous and selfless service.\" A photo showed Poroshenko with Korotkykh, dressed in military attire. Experts on the far right criticized Poroshenko's decision, noting Korotkykh's involvement with far-right groups like the Russian National Unity party and the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS), which aims to incite a race war, according to academic Anton Shekhovtsov. Though Korotkykh faced charges for a 2007 Moscow bombing and a 2013 stabbing in Minsk, he was released due to insufficient evidence, though activist Halya Coynash argued the accusations, if true, were grave. Ukrainian officials, including security services head Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, dismissed claims of Korotkykh's neo-Nazi affiliations as slanderous, asserting no counterintelligence information precluded his citizenship.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "The counter claim that there is no far right in Ukraine is equally false.

There are Jews as in Russian-speaking Jewish speaker of parliament Volodymyr Groysman who is the third highest statesman in the land. Nonetheless, Ukrainian officials and most media then argue - incorrectly - that there is no fascism at all in Ukrainian politics. The presence of a far right is therefore a sore point for Ukrainian officials and media who prefer not to discuss the subject so as not to provide ammunition for Russian Information Warfare dis-information.

The outbreak has been running all year, but the latest in a stream of worrying statistics shows 40% of all the deaths have been in just the past three weeks. So what can we expect in the months, and possibly years, to come? Crystal-ball gazing can be a dangerous affair, particularly as this is uncharted territory. Previous outbreaks have been rapidly contained, affecting just dozens of people; this one has already infected more than 3,900. But the first clues are in the current data. Dr Christopher Dye, the director of strategy in the office of the director general at the World Health Organization, has the difficult challenge of predicting what will happen next. He told the BBC: \"We're quite worried, I have to say, about the latest data we've just gathered.\" Up until a couple of weeks ago, the outbreak was raging in Liberia especially close to the epicentre of the outbreak in Lofa County and in the capital Monrovia. However, the two other countries primarily hit by the outbreak, Sierra Leone and Guinea, had been relatively stable. Numbers of new cases were not falling, but they were not soaring either. That is no longer true, with a surge in cases everywhere except some parts of rural Sierra Leone in the districts of Kenema and Kailahun. \"In most other areas, cases and deaths appear to be rising. That came as a shock to me,\" said Dr Dye. The stories of healthcare workers being stretched beyond breaking point are countless. A lack of basic protective gear such as gloves has been widely reported. The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has an isolation facility with 160 beds in Monrovia. But it says the queues are growing and they need another 800 beds to deal with the number of people who are already sick. This is not a scenario for containing an epidemic, but fuelling one. Dr Dye's tentative forecasts are grim: \"At the moment we're seeing about 500 new cases each week. Those numbers appear to be increasing. \"I've just projected about five weeks into the future and if current trends persist we would be seeing not hundreds of cases per week, but thousands of cases per week and that is terribly disturbing. \"The situation is bad and we have to prepare for it getting worse.\" The World Health Organization is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response.", "text_ai_base": "Healthcare workers are visibly overwhelmed, and the response to the outbreak has been criticized as \"lethally inadequate.\" The situation is showing signs of considerable worsening.

But, following the global economic downturn in 2008, and increasingly volatile commodity prices, the country's reliance on diamonds has come into question. For the first time Botswana finds itself cash strapped, in negative growth, and having to go to international donors. The country is looking to diversify its economy by strengthening existing sectors like tourism and cattle farming, and investing in burgeoning industries spawning from technology and entrepreneurship. Yet diamonds by far outshine any other industry in Botswana, accounting for one-third of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues. However, production has peaked, and experts believe reserves of the precious stone may run out by 2030. Unemployment is also on the rise, with official jobless rates nearing 20%, and an estimated 45% of Botswana's population living below the poverty line. Economic growth was also negative in 2009, and the industrial sector shrank by 30%. Signs of labour unrest have also began showing following public sector strikes in recent years. As Linah Mohohlo, who has been governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, put it in a recent interview with BBC Africa Business Report: \"It is a serious concern to government, for many years now strategies have been put in place to diversify the economy away from mining.\" In many ways Botswana is seen as becoming a victim of its own making. Policies have favoured and protected the diamond industry, and strategies and institutions that assisted and protected its growth for decades have made implementation and expansion of newer, alternative industries difficult. The strong role of the state in the economy, plus bloated bureaucracy, often also makes it difficult for investors to enter the market. Most contracts are also government sponsored, making it hard for entrepreneurs to set up shop and compete. Despite being in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa, and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe makes it a bit of a rough neighbourhood. In response Ms Mohohlo says she's more worried about competition from the country's neighbours, especially for foreign direct investment, and says Botswana needs to \"sharpen its pencils\". The manufacturing industry, for example, has \"not done what we expected it to do\", she says. The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining. In addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge.", "text_ai_base": "Widely regarded as the least corrupt country on the continent, Botswana boasts the longest-standing multiparty democracy and one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, after the 2008 global economic downturn and increasing volatility in commodity prices, concerns have emerged about the country's dependence on diamonds. For the first time, Botswana is experiencing financial constraints, negative growth, and the need to seek help from international donors. In response, the nation is aiming to diversify its economy by bolstering existing sectors such as tourism and cattle farming, while investing in emerging industries driven by technology and entrepreneurship. Despite these efforts, diamonds remain the dominant industry, contributing one-third to the GDP, 70% to export earnings, and one-third to government revenue. Nevertheless, diamond production has hit its peak, and experts estimate reserves could be exhausted by 2030. Unemployment is rising, with official rates nearing 20%, and about 45% of the population living below the poverty line. In 2009, economic growth was negative, and the industrial sector contracted by 30%. Signs of labor unrest have appeared following recent public sector strikes. Linah Mohohlo, who has served as governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, expressed concerns in a BBC Africa Business Report interview, noting that the government has long been focused on diversifying the economy away from mining. Botswana is seen as partly a victim of its own policies, which have prioritized and protected the diamond industry, making it challenging to develop and expand newer, alternative industries. State involvement in the economy and bureaucratic hurdles also deter investors from entering the market, as most contracts are government-sponsored, limiting entrepreneurial ventures. Although situated in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe create challenges. Mohohlo is particularly concerned about competition with neighboring countries for foreign direct investment, urging Botswana to improve its competitiveness. The manufacturing sector, for instance, has not met expectations, contributing only about 5% to GDP, despite employing more workers than the mining industry. Furthermore, Botswana faces the challenge of its small domestic market of two million people and competing with South Africa.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Most people see Botswana as Africa\u2019s most honest nation\u2014its democracy barely changes, and the economy?

Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two? The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to \"taking an egg out of omelette\"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \"wanted to serve\" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a \"third way\" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage.

Officials at the Bank generally believed Carney had two choices: either remain until 2021 or leave as initially planned in 2018. However, Carney introduced a third option: extending his term, but only by one year. This decision seemed like an awkward compromise. Was Mr. Carney feeling political pressure to avoid extending until 2021, or was he discouraged by the bleak economic forecasts for the UK post-Brexit, prompting a desire to leave? Another possible factor was how his family, particularly reluctant about another three years in the UK with him often traveling for global summits, felt about the situation. This seemed to be the deciding factor. When he took office in 2013, it was almost unimaginable that the UK would soon be negotiating its exit from the EU, a process Pascal Lamy, the former WTO head, compared to \"taking an egg out of an omelette.\" That changed on June 23, complicating matters for Carney. Leaving in 2018 would mean departing in the midst of Brexit negotiations. Should he then extend his term to the typical eight-year period expected of governors to reassure nervous markets? Carney recognized the job's evolving challenges, even telling confidants he \"wanted to serve\" longer, which led to media predictions that he'd fulfill the eight-year term.

Some were worried about candidates imposed on them from outside Wales - candidates like former Tory MPs Mark Reckless and Neil Hamilton. Mr Gill won't be drawn on individuals.

They think the whole selection should've been run fully in Wales, so they want him step down. He's been in Wales doing UKIP work for eleven years, walked every street and knows almost all the members. **I see our members\u2014quality, passion, ability\u2014and I've always backed them.** Other\u2011party critics, they shout that UKIP is anti\u2011Welsh and might doubt that claim; still, the critics inside the party are the ones who pose a far tougher problem. Since the NEC kept the candidate decisions hidden, critics not in those meetings must take Mr. Gill\u2019s word, therefore. Sure, some people don't like me; therefore I say my supporters they far outnumber the ones who don't. He claims the folks who attack him do it for personal reasons\u2014maybe they just flipped their stance on running\u2014as if the idea that he doesn\u2019t speak for the rank\u2011and\u2011file were pure nonsense. Even though the candidate list looks tangled compared to other parties, Mr. Gill asks\u202f-\u202fcan UKIP be the distinct choice? He says yes, it\u2019s a different alternative; therefore it stands apart. Even though he\u2019s an MEP, he doesn\u2019t feel part of the political class. Therefore, unsurprising\u2014people today just don\u2019t trust politicians. Therefore, who these days claims they is part of political class? I popped over to their tiny B&B on Anglesey; therefore he and Jana are busy raising five children while hosting guests. Therefore, he sometimes wonders, can he dodge the backlash from those who keep urging him to quit? *Naturally I feel that way: after all I'm just human, so part of me does.*", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 91, "wordsSpent": 729, "remainingCredits": 92618, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Medium", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

The 66-year-old war veteran and his wife Vimbai kissed their way into the Book of African Records, after scooping the top prize in a competition organised as part of Valentine's Day celebrations. The couple, who have been married for eight years, won \"The Longest Kiss in Africa Challenge\", locking lips for a record 10 minutes and 17 seconds, beating the previous African record by five minutes and 17 seconds. Though the Chinotimbas' passion didn't quite match that of the world record holders from Thailand, who kissed for 58 hours, 35 minutes and 58 seconds. Later in the year, one Nigerian MP gave an example of just how far women still have to go in the battle against abusive language and gender equality. After a row during a closed door session of the Senate in July, Dino Melaye allegedly threatened to beat up and \"impregnate\" a female colleague, Oluremi Tinubu. Mr Melaye later denied saying this, releasing a statement that shocked some commentators: \"Biologically, it is even impossible to impregnate Tinubu because she has arrived at menopause.\" According to Nigeria's Punch newspaper, Ms Tinubu said she would forgive the comments, but would remain defiant in public life in socially conservative country. \"I am not championing a cause for women. I am only standing in my space and if my space is encroached upon, I have to fight back. \"Rosa Parks wasn't an activist; she just decided to sit in her space and not give up her space anybody in a bus. And that sent a message.\" Despite the various ways in which women are denied basic human rights across Africa, they are allowed to vote. But during past elections in Zambia, women wearing nail varnish were not allowed to cast their ballot unless they first wiped their fingernails clean. Officials complained that the nail varnish prevented them from applying the indelible ink correctly. However, the situation changed this August when Zambia went to the polls in an election that led to a fresh term for President Edgar Lungu. A few days before the votes were cast, the country's electoral commission posted on social media, saying women with \"painted nails and/or false nails\" could exercise their democratic right. In a peculiar move towards gender equality, Cameroon's parliament in June debated a new law which would see men who commit adultery sent to jail.

Mr Davutoglu told a meeting of Turkish newspaper editors that, following Turkey's military action, there were now \"new conditions\" in the regional conflict. \"The presence of a Turkey that can use its force effectively can lead to consequences which can change the game in Syria, Iraq and the entire region; everyone should see that,\" the Hurriyet Daily News quoted him as saying. Turkey - a Nato member - has requested Tuesday's meeting based on Article 4 of the organisation's founding treaty, which allows members to request such a meeting if their territorial integrity or security is threatened. \"When Turkey requests for such a meeting I think it's very right and very timely to have a meeting where we address the turmoil and the instability we see in Syria, Iraq and surrounding and close to Nato borders of Turkey,\" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC. Mr Davutoglu said Turkey was prepared to work with the Syrian Kurdish PYD group - which has links to the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) - provided it did not pose a threat to Turkey and severed relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. However, the raids against the PKK in northern Iraq effectively ended a two-year ceasefire. Turkey's dangerous game Who are the PKK? Turkish press warning over air strikes In recent days, Turkey has also arrested hundreds of people suspected of supporting IS or the PKK. Police raids on suspected IS and PKK members in the city of Istanbul triggered three days of rioting in the Gazi district. At least one activist and a policeman have been killed. The US has called on both Turkey and the PKK to avoid violence, but said Turkey had the right to defend itself against attacks by Kurdish rebels. In a statement on Monday, the YPG said Turkish tanks had shelled the Kurdish-held village of Zormikhar inside Syria late on Sunday evening and an hour later one of its vehicles \"came under heavy fire from the Turkish military east of Kobane in the village of Til Findire\". It said: \"Instead of targeting IS terrorists' occupied positions, Turkish forces attack our defenders' positions. This is not the right attitude.", "text_ai_base": "Ahmet Davutoglu noted that airstrikes targeting IS positions near the Syria-Turkey border and Kurdish PKK separatists in Iraq could significantly change the dynamics of the conflict.

NATO is set to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to address the situation. On Monday, the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), the armed branch of the main Syrian Kurdish party, called on Turkey to halt its attacks on Kurdish units in Syria. In a meeting with Turkish newspaper editors, Mr. Davutoglu said that Turkey's military actions have created \"new conditions\" in the regional conflict. \"With Turkey capable of using its force effectively, the game could change in Syria, Iraq, and throughout the region; everyone should recognize this,\" he was quoted as saying by the Hurriyet Daily News. As a NATO member, Turkey has invoked Article 4 of the organization's founding treaty, which allows members to request consultations if their territorial integrity or security is under threat. \"Turkey's call for this meeting is very appropriate and timely, as we need to address the chaos and instability surrounding Syria, Iraq, and Turkey's NATO borders,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC.

He became a fixture in new Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier's starting line-up this season, repaying the Frenchman with four goals. Now, days before vying to win his third Scotland cap after being included in Gordon Strachan's squad for Sunday's opening World Cup qualifier in Malta, Burke has switched to the German Bundesliga after RB Leipzig paid the English Championship club \u00a313m for his services. Here's five things you should know about the teenager tipped to be the football superstar for which Scotland has long been yearning. Born in Kirkcaldy on 7 April 1997, Burke was brought up in England and joined Nottingham Forest's youth academy at the age of eight. He signed a professional contract shortly before being handed his first-team debut by Stuart Pearce as a late substitute in a 3-1 Capital One Cup defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 24 September 2014. A one-month loan to Bradford City was to follow and two outings in English League One defeats contributed to an inauspicious start to his career. However, on his return to Forest, he gradually established himself as a fixture in the Championship club's first-team squad under fellow Scot Dougie Freedman last season. With his bulging thighs and broad shoulders holding up a 6ft 2in frame, Burke would not look out of place among the bulked-up wingers who these days grace the fields of top-class rugby union. And, by the time he scored his first Forest goal in December's 1-1 draw for Cardiff City, he had elbowed compatriot and namesake Chris Burke out of the picture at the City Ground. Burke the elder, the former Rangers, Cardiff City, Birmingham City and Scotland winger now on trial at Kilmarnock, was subsequently taking his more diminutive frame to Championship rivals Rotherham United on loan before being released at the end of the season. Burke had still featured more from the Forest bench - 18 out of 31 appearances - than the starting line-up, but that did not deter Strachan from calling him into the Scotland squad for the first time in March. Strachan has suggested it was a happy coincidence that Burke had impressed for Forest while the head coach was on a scouting mission to watch striker Tony Watt in action for Charlton Athletic.

He also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.

It means virtually all of their profits are being handed over to councils, with some energy schemes now making a loss, BBC Wales has heard. The Welsh Government said it was aware and considering the case for specific assistance. The British Hydropower Association accused ministers of \"sitting on their hands\" while Community Energy Wales said it was \"ripping the guts\" out of projects. Community energy schemes are often small enterprises run by volunteers, designed to generate income for their area. But the way business rates are calculated means hydro schemes are hit hard: Business rates in England and Wales are calculated by an independent body - the Valuation Office Agency - but the Welsh Government is in charge of how they are raised here. The British Hydropower Association has written to Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford to ask for support. Chief executive Simon Hamlyn said: \"Community hydro schemes are suffering and those businesses will say we can't afford to pay these rates and they'll abandon these schemes and that's the last thing we want.\" Keith Jones, director of Community Energy Wales, said the average increase was 300%. \"No-one could foresee this coming, we didn't even put it down as a risk in our business plans that such a blunt instrument would be used to get more money out of us.\" Mr Jones said the Scottish government had extended a 100% business rates relief for community energy schemes while in England they were capping the increase at \u00a3600. Gavin Gatehouse helps run the Ynni Anafon hydro scheme in Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd, which has seen its monthly rate rise from about \u00a3900 to more than \u00a32,000. It took five years to set up and could generate up to \u00a340,000 of disposable income per year for projects in the area. A charity has been formed so groups and individuals can apply for grants, but this increase means there will be less money to hand out. The community hydro at Bethesda is predicting it will now make a loss. \"It's very frustrating and I'm very angry about it,\" Mr Gatehouse said. \"We'll be seeing a huge proportion of our profit eaten away to substitute for lack of government provision of grants to local authorities.\" Mr Drakeford has said more than \u00a3210m of rate relief was being provided for 2017-18 to businesses including community energy projects. \"We are going to prepare a new scheme for rate relief for small business from 2018 onwards.", "text_ai_base": "After a recent reassessment, some have experienced tax increases as high as 900%, a situation many are calling \"ridiculous.\" This hike means nearly all profits from some energy schemes are being turned over to councils, leading some to operate at a loss, according to BBC Wales. Aware of the issue, the Welsh Government is contemplating specific assistance. However, the British Hydropower Association has criticized ministers for inaction, and Community Energy Wales remarked that these changes are severely damaging projects. Typically small and volunteer-run, community energy schemes generate local income. However, the method for calculating business rates is disproportionately affecting hydro schemes. These rates in England and Wales are determined by the Valuation Office Agency, with the Welsh Government controlling the rates' implementation in Wales. The British Hydropower Association has requested support from Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford. Simon Hamlyn, the chief executive, stated that community hydro schemes are struggling, and businesses might abandon them due to unaffordable rates, which is a scenario they want to avoid. Keith Jones, director of Community Energy Wales, noted a typical increase of 300%, adding that they hadn\u2019t foreseen such a drastic financial tool in their business plans. Meanwhile, the Scottish government has offered 100% business rates relief for community energy schemes, and England has capped the increase at \u00a3600. Gavin Gatehouse, involved with the Ynni Anafon hydro scheme in Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd, says their monthly rate has jumped from around \u00a3900 to over \u00a32,000. The project, which took five years to establish, could generate up to \u00a340,000 in annual income for regional initiatives. A charity was established to provide grants, but this increase limits available funds. The Bethesda community hydro scheme also anticipates losses. \"It's very frustrating and I'm very angry about it,\" Mr. Gatehouse expressed. \"Our profits are being drastically reduced to compensate for insufficient government grants to local authorities.\" Mr. Drakeford noted that over \u00a3210 million in rate relief was allocated for 2017-18 to support businesses, including community energy projects.

The Welsh Government was aware of the problem and was considering targeted help. But the British Hydropower Association accused ministers of doing nothing, while Community Energy Wales told the BBC that the changes were \"crippling\" projects. Community energy schemes are generally on a small scale and run by groups of volunteers, with money raised going into the local community. But the system for assessing business rates is having a disproportionate effect on hydro schemes. Rates in England and Wales are set by the Valuation Office Agency, the Welsh Government having powers over the rates in Wales. The British Hydropower Association has asked Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford for help. Its chief executive Simon Hamlyn said: \"Community hydro schemes are now really struggling. \"People who are running businesses have now said, 'Well we just can't afford it, so we're just going to walk away from the scheme.' \"We do not want to do that.\" Community Energy Wales director Keith Jones said the rise on most hydro schemes was 300%. \"No business plan we've ever looked at features hitting them with effectively a huge tax,\" he said, adding the increase was \"crippling\" projects. The Scottish government has given 100% business rates relief to all community energy schemes, while England has seen the rise capped at \u00a3600.

The Welsh Government was aware of the problem and was considering targeted help. But the British Hydropower Association accused ministers of doing nothing, while Community Energy Wales told the BBC that the changes were \"crippling\" projects. Community energy schemes are generally on a small scale and run by groups of volunteers, with money raised going into the local community. But the system for assessing business rates is having a disproportionate effect on hydro schemes. Rates in England and Wales are set by the Valuation Office Agency, the Welsh Government having powers over the rates in Wales. The British Hydropower Association has asked Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford for help. Its chief executive Simon Hamlyn said: \"Community hydro schemes are now really struggling. \"People who are running businesses have now said, 'Well we just can't afford it, so we're just going to walk away from the scheme.' \"We do not want to do that.\" Community Energy Wales director Keith Jones said the rise on most hydro schemes was 300%. \"No business plan we've ever looked at features hitting them with effectively a huge tax,\" he said, adding the increase was \"crippling\" projects.

But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered \"almost jokingly\" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: \"According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. \"This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. \" At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. \"That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes,\" Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours.

However, the era of the home-grown inventor might still thrive. David Williams and John Dingley, consultant anesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, experienced their eureka moment while tinkering in their garages with glue guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they joked about creating something similarly economical and user-friendly for the medical field. Given Dr. Williams\u2019s experience in remote areas, he recognized the importance of equipment that functions independently of constant power sources. In Zambia, he saw entire operating theaters unused due to a lack of spare light bulbs or reliable power. Motivated by this, they aimed to invent essential medical tools within a tight budget. After a week of modifying conventional medical equipment with power tools, they created the ShakerScope prototype\u2014a light source adaptable for examining the eyes, ears, and throat, without the need for batteries. Dr. Patrick Finlay of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers remarked, \"According to the World Health Organization, 95% of medical devices fail in developing countries. Designers in the West often overlook global conditions. This kind of invention is essential. Normally, you need three different battery-powered instruments for such exams. For low-income countries, this is impractical.\" The ShakerScope operates with a powerful movable magnet surrounded by a wire coil. As Michael Faraday discovered in 1831, moving the magnet induces an electric current in the coil. Shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds generates enough current to light the device for three minutes. \"While this may seem brief, it's adequate for most ear and eye exams or inserting tracheal tubes,\" Dr. Williams stated. Once charged, the device can maintain its power for weeks, and its light-emitting diode lasts up to 10,000 hours. The team also designed interchangeable heads, enabling conversion into multiple devices.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "Today it is common to imagine novel inventions emerging from anonymous Eurekas and popping out of nondescript laboratories teeming with young scientists after many grant applications.

She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. From the start of her time as prime minister Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. When she came to power in 1979 she wanted to make big changes to how the country was run - and she transformed Britain. One of her biggest changes was that she wanted private companies and people, and not officials, to run government-owned things like British Gas and BT (British Telecom). She believed that private companies would run the services better. Thousands of ordinary people were able to buy their council houses, giving them more of a stake in society. Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business. The PM became a hero to many when in 1982 she sent British Troops to defend the Falklands. The tiny islands eight thousand miles away in the South Atlantic sea had been invaded by Argentina. Although hundreds of lives were lost, the victory was celebrated on the streets back home. Read more: Tributes to Margaret Thatcher But though she had many supporters, some of the changes she introduced were very unpopular and there were protests and riots on the streets. In 1984 thousands of miners protested for a whole year against her plans to shut down lots of coal mines and cut lots of jobs. And in 1990, there was fighting on the streets of London because of a new tax - called the poll tax - that people thought hit poor people harder than the rich. Margaret Thatcher was thought to have survived on just four hours sleep a night - and got the nickname \"the Iron Lady\" for being tough and sticking to her decisions. In 2012 a big movie was made of her life, called The Iron Lady. Was Lady Thatcher an inspiration to girls? After 11 years in power - and winning three elections - she'd been prime minister for longer than anyone else in the 20th century.

Her ceremonial funeral with full military honors took place on April 17. From the moment she became prime minister, Thatcher sparked debate. Upon coming to power in 1979, she aimed for significant changes in the nation's governance, leading to a profound transformation of Britain. One of her major initiatives was shifting control of government-owned entities like British Gas and BT (British Telecom) to private companies, believing they would manage these services more efficiently. She enabled thousands of ordinary people to purchase their council homes, giving them a greater stake in society. Her leadership helped the City of London emerge as a global hub for banking and business. Thatcher became a hero when she dispatched British troops to defend the Falklands Islands in 1982, after Argentina invaded the tiny archipelago located 8,000 miles away in the South Atlantic. Although the conflict resulted in hundreds of casualties, the victory was celebrated back home. However, despite considerable support, some of Thatcher's policies were highly controversial, leading to protests and riots. In 1984, thousands of miners opposed her plans to close numerous coal mines and eliminate many jobs by protesting continuously for a year. Similarly, in 1990, the introduction of the poll tax led to clashes in London, as critics argued it disproportionately affected the poor rather than the wealthy. Thatcher, famously known as the \"Iron Lady\" for her resilience and firm decision-making, reportedly survived on just four hours of sleep a night. Her life story was brought to the silver screen in 2012 with the movie \"The Iron Lady.\" After 11 years in power and winning three elections, Thatcher was the longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century.

Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. \"Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation,\" he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs. If Beavercrest were to close, children from the town would have to spend up to 90 minutes in a bus commuting to one of three other schools in the area. It has 195 students but has a capacity for 319, according to a recent report by the local school board. \"We all realise that something needs to happen and something needs to change, but whatever happens needs to benefit the students,\" he said.

Chapman's, which was founded in 1973 by his parents, is one of the largest ice cream manufacturers in Canada and has doubled its workforce over the past six years, he said.

In a press conference hours later, National Security Adviser HR McMaster said Mr Trump's revelations where \"wholly appropriate\". This was always going to be the most effective response, as the president has broad powers to declassify whatever he deems necessary. As the old Richard Nixon line goes: \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal\". The president's explanation is not absolution, however. A wave of the hand on Twitter isn't going to make this story go away any time soon. Here are five reasons why. Let's get the impeachment question out of the way first. Shortly after the Washington Post story detailing the allegations broke, there were cries of \"treason\" from Mr Trump's more vociferous critics and calls for immediate removal from office. The charge that Mr Trump, through ignorance or boastfulness, casually disclosed highly classified intelligence for no reason may not be a criminal offence, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't create a political controversy that could, in a worst-case scenario for the president, end in his impeachment. The process for impeachment for \"high crimes and misdemeanours\" as outlined in the US constitution is a political act. A simple majority of the House of Representatives can impeach, initiating a trial in the Senate and a two-thirds vote necessarily for removal. As the writers of Lawfare Blog point out, Mr Trump's opponents could accuse him of violations of his oath of office to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the US Constitution - a catch-all category cited in the three previous times a president has been seriously threatened with impeachment. Just because it's possible, however, doesn't mean it's likely. And again, it has nothing to do with the law and everything to do with politics - and how the story plays out from here. Like Indiana Jones looking at a chamber full of snakes, many in the Trump White House must be muttering to themselves: \"Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?\" Allegations of cosier-than-desired relations with the US geopolitical adversary have bedevilled Mr Trump since the early days of his presidential campaign. He's been questioned about the praise he's lavished on President Vladimir Putin, some of his aides are caught up in the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the US 2016 election, his attorney general was forced to recuse himself because of an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and his first national security adviser was fired for obfuscating about his Russia ties (and is one of the people under FBI investigation to boot).", "text_ai_base": "In a series of Tuesday morning tweets, the president described any release of intelligence information as a strategic effort to further U.S. national security priorities. Later that day, National Security Adviser HR McMaster defended Mr. Trump's actions as \"wholly appropriate\" during a press conference.

As the old Richard Nixon quote suggests, \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\" However, the president\u2019s justification doesn\u2019t make the issue disappear, and a Twitter statement alone won\u2019t quell the controversy.

After the Washington Post reported the allegations, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest critics accused him of \"treason\" and demanded his immediate removal from office.

Some in the Trump White House might be echoing Indiana Jones\u2019 famous lament: \"Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?\" Claims of overly close ties with America's geopolitical rival have dogged Mr. Trump since his presidential campaign began. He has faced scrutiny over his praise for President Vladimir Putin, some aides are involved in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, his attorney general recused himself over an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and his first national security adviser was dismissed for misleading about his Russian connections (and is now under FBI investigation).", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "On Tuesday mornings he posted a string of tweets, saying any intel leak? just a strategic push to move U forward. **National security priorities: what truly matters?** Later that day HR McMaster, the National Security Adviser, called Trump\u2019s actions wholly appropriate; therefore he defended them at the press conference.

The funding shake-up will also remove local authorities from the process, with cash going directly to heads. Labour has accused the government of \"dodging difficult questions\" about who will lose funding in the changes. Mrs Morgan says schools need funding that \"genuinely matches their need\". She says the plans will ensure money goes \"straight to the frontline\", but it will mark a further reduction in the link between local authorities and schools. On Monday the education secretary has taken the next step towards introducing a new school funding formula in 2017-18, after complaints about local anomalies and spending gaps. For example, pupils in Rotherham each receive \u00a3500 per year more in funding than those in Plymouth, even though they have similar levels of disadvantage. In December, MPs led by former Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart presented a petition calling for change, saying the best-funded areas received up to \u00a36,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded received \u00a34,200. The government has a manifesto pledge to create a more consistent way to distribute more than \u00a340bn per year of the core schools budget - and says it wants to end funding rates based on \"oddities of history\". Further details were announced in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, with the promise of a national rate for each pupil, with extra funding for those with additional needs. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, backed the principle of a fairer redistribution of funding. He also supported a \"big shift\" in more money going directly to schools. But he warned that there would be both \"winners and losers\" under a new funding regime and there was still \"scant detail\" about how this would be decided. There have been warnings that some schools will lose out, particularly in inner London. Christine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said the proposals would \"impose huge funding cuts on many schools unless additional funding is made available. Schools are already suffering real terms cuts to per pupil funding\". Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of a change to funding arrangements. \"However simply redistributing the current pot of money is not enough on its own to address the significant real-terms cuts currently hitting school budgets. Greater investment is needed,\" said Mr Trobe. The Department for Education says the current system is out of date and no longer reflect levels of need.

Before the law was passed, there were about 100 so-called \"headshops\" selling legal highs across the state, but that number has since been reduced to zero. \"The headshop industry is gone,\" Det Supt Tony Howard told the BBC. He is a member of the Garda (Irish police) Drugs Unit, which has been responsible for enforcing the new legislation. \"We were worried because we saw a whole generation of young people starting to experiment with these new psychoactive substances, and they'd generally be people who wouldn't have otherwise engaged in the misuse of drugs,\" he said. \"They thought it was safe because of the perception that these were legal highs.\" When the blanket ban took effect, it became illegal to advertise, sell, supply, import or export psychoactive substances in the Republic of Ireland. Tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and medicines have been excluded from the ban. Before the legislation came into force, the sale of legal highs appeared to be a very lucrative business. When one Dublin city centre headshop was burnt down in an arson attack, firefighters found a safe in the charred rubble of the building that contained 450,000 euros (\u00c2\u00a3330,000). As the sale of psychoactive substances was not illegal at the time, police had to hand the cash back to the owner of the safe. As a result of the ban, that would not happen now. Det Supt Howard said many of those who operated the headshops quickly complied with the new law. \"Essentially the industry themselves realised that the legislation was quiet strong and they actually co-operated with us and handed us over any residual product which they had,\" he said. So, should the UK follow the Irish government's lead and outlaw legal highs? It may have taken the headshops out of the high street but not everyone believes the ban is the most effective way to protect drug users. Tony Duffin, director of the Ana Liffey Drug Project in Dublin said there was still \"huge harm\" associated with the substances formally sold by headshops. He said many recreational users are now buying psychoactive substances over the internet instead, and more regular users just go to drug dealers. \"I'm aware that, in New Zealand, they are currently rolling out legislation to regulate headshop drugs.

In a regulatory filing, the US company explained that - under Virgin's own reporting standards - the figures included premises where installation work was \"essentially complete\" but not actually finished. That included 142,000 sites that had been expected to be connected during the first three months of 2017.

Here is a selection of your experiences and opinions about the idea. How can we say we want equality over pay and employment and then ask for a day's extra 'holiday' per month just for being a female? That's not asking for equality, that's saying women aren't as able to work as men, which surely kills all argument for equality... Guess what, I'm a female who has a period every month and I am still able to work as well as any man! If some women can't then that's their problem and they need to see a doctor! Charlotte Rachael, Halifax, UK Personally, I suffer, for up to two weeks straight, I suffer. I've passed out through temporary anaemia at work. I've had to stop walking and hold on to a wall or a fence when walking to work. But I don't consider it necessary to call in sick, nor do I believe additional leave days should be required... We don't need additional leave, those who are suffering so badly need to push with their GPs to see a specialist. To award additional days leaves companies open to being taken advantage of by women who aren't suffering and just don't want to go to work for whatever reason. Lyndsey Victoria Corp, Barnsley, UK Unfortunately, this is exactly why women make less money. Okay, well... it contributes. We are just gonna have to \"man up\" if we expect equality. Valerie Richardson, Oregon, US The idea [of menstrual leave] makes sense to a degree, but surely unpaid leave will increase the wage gap (fewer hours means lower wages), which many people seem to take issue with. If it were to be paid leave, people who take the leave will either have to work harder to make up the time, or an earnings gap will develop, which is a much bigger problem than a wage gap, since fewer hours worked and equal wages means more money per hour worked for the same job, which is normally illegal. Obviously time off because of pain isn't a holiday, but it's simply not providing value to the company. I guess another alternative would be government subsidy, but I'm generally against too much of that in principle. Alex, Dundee, UK I do sympathise with women who have a genuine problem.

That doesn't promote equality; it suggests women can't perform as effectively as men, undermining the argument for equality altogether. I\u2019m a woman, and despite having a period every month, I can work as competently as any man. If some women struggle, they should consult a doctor\u2014it's their issue! Charlotte Rachael, Halifax, UK Personally, I endure pain for up to two weeks continuously. I've fainted at work due to temporary anemia. I've had to stop and hold onto a wall or fence while walking to work. Yet, I don\u2019t deem it necessary to call in sick, nor do I think additional leave is required. Those suffering severely should persist in getting specialist help from their GP. Allowing extra leave exposes companies to exploitation by women who aren't suffering but simply wish to extend their time off for personal reasons. Lyndsey Victoria Corp, Barnsley, UK Sadly, such issues contribute to lower male-dominated salaries. If we want equality, we need to toughen up. Valerie Richardson, Oregon, US The concept of menstrual leave seems sensible to an extent, but unpaid leave could widen the wage gap since fewer hours result in lower wages, which is a concern for many. If it were paid, those taking leave would need to work harder to compensate, or an earnings gap would emerge\u2014a more significant issue than the wage gap, as fewer hours and equal pay lead to higher pay per hour, typically unlawful. Time off for pain isn\u2019t a holiday, but it doesn\u2019t provide company value either. Perhaps government subsidies could be an option, but I'm generally against excessive intervention.

But let's start with to bulk up and get on in rugby, and leave the Heineken Cup for another day. The public statement made by Sam Chalmers, son of one of our finest ever players Craig, is that he is sorry and that he got the stuff off the internet. It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it? Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand Here is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now. What I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you. Some players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more. Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards. Perhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice. So is it possible to get big enough taking food alone? The IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby.", "text_ai_base": "Determining which event shocked us more\u2014the first positive steroids test in Scottish rugby history or the criticism of Scottish, Welsh, and Irish teams qualifying for the Heineken Cup from a non-relegation league\u2014is challenging. However, let's focus on the steroids issue and leave the Heineken Cup discussion for another time. Sam Chalmers, son of one of our esteemed players, Craig Chalmers, publicly apologized, claiming he bought the steroids online. This explanation resembles the \"lone wolf\" narrative. Was Sam truly the only one using them? Did he discuss it with others? Coaches in youth rugby have mentioned that weight training and supplement use are closely linked. It's understandable that players feel pressured to grow bigger and heavier\u2014while the rugby field size hasn't changed in 150 years, people have. Modern rugby often involves more brute force than agility. What I don't accept is the notion that players feel pressured to use steroids. This is cheating. Purchasing steroids is knowingly breaking the rules and hoping to evade detection by drug testers. Some players might have considered steroids but decided against it. If you're not naturally large enough, perhaps rugby isn't the right path for you. It\u2019s no longer a sport for all body types. Young players are often with supplements; they use them before, during, and after workouts, perhaps believing they can't achieve their goals with food alone. This mindset might lead to the dangerous conclusion that artificial aids, including steroids, are necessary. So, can one achieve size with just a natural diet?

The young man involved, Sam Chalmers, son of one of our great players, Craig Chalmers, has since apologised and says he purchased the steroids over the web.

Det Ch Insp McVea said: \"I am aware that in the immediate aftermath of Kevin's murder there has been a large amount of speculation surrounding who may be responsible, the motivation behind the attack and Kevin's standing in the community. \"MciGuigan was never considered a suspect in the murder of Jock Davison, but he was believed to have been in a position to witness the incident at the time it occurred - and that is still the standing police assessment.\" \"Let's be absolutely clear here, speculation of this nature is reckless - it is foolhardy and has the potential to leave Kevin's family enjoying further harm and suffering.\" \"It is absolutely vital that the police investigation is allowed to take its course. At the same time, it is equally important that if anyone has information surrounding last night's murder please come to forward and tell us what you know as a matter of urgency.\" Although MvVea stopped short of naming McGuigan as a suspect he suggested at a press conference this afternoon that the investigation into Davison's murder is still considering all options. He also called on community representatives to help in easing tensions in the area. \"Now is the time for calm heads. When emotions are high I would ask our community leaders to exercise calm and restraint in these difficult circumstances.\"", "howLikelyToBeDetected": 82, "wordsSpent": 872, "remainingCredits": 59449, "systemTokensSpent": 0, "tokensSpent": 0, "totalTokensSpent": 0}, "status_code": 200, "settings": {"tone": null, "mode": "Medium", "business": false, "is_multilingual": false, "detector": null}}, "humanizer_error": null}

What is the secret to the film's success? Although he spent many years in supporting roles and is best known for his comic role in cult US sitcom Parks and Recreation, Pratt has become one of Hollywood's most bankable stars in the past year. He starred in two of 2014's top five grossing films at the US box office - The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy.

Against expectations, the film took $774m (\u00a3499m) at the global box office - making it the third highest-grossing film in 2014. The actor didn't exactly get hit with the ugly stick, either. There is a strict quota on the number of foreign films which can be screened in China - currently set at 34 movies a year. But the country's film market is the world's second largest after the US so getting your film on the list can boost box office takings considerably. Most Hollywood blockbusters do not open in China the same time as the US but unusually, Jurassic World opened in both territories the same weekend. The film opened in 66 foreign markets in total, earning $307.2m (\u00a3198m). China accounted for $100.8m (\u00a365m) - almost 20% of its total haul. When Jurassic Park was released Imax screens were scarce, reserved usually for short films, documentaries and theme park novelties. With some 800 Imax screens around the world now, the prospect of seeing dinosaurs even larger than life-size has proved to be a compelling draw. With the added ability to see a T-Rex in 3D, it seems audiences have been happy to pay premium prices for extra spectacle - bumping up box office returns in the process. According to box office analysts Rentrak, nearly 50% of Jurassic World's US box office came from 3D screenings. Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park holds a special place in the memories of many cinema fans. It set a new standard for CGI, and became a touchstone of 1990s cinema, capturing a generation's imagination. \"I was 12 when Jurassic Park came out and it just blew me away,\" Jurassic World actress Dallas Bryce Howard told the BBC. \"I remember watching it and thinking, 'I'm seeing real dinosaurs right now'. It felt so real.\" \"I was 13 years old and I felt the same,\" her co-star Chris Pratt added.", "text_ai_base": "In the US, the film brought in $204.6 million (\u00a3132 million) according to early estimates, making it the second-largest opening weekend ever, just behind 2012's Marvel's The Avengers with $207.4 million (\u00a3133.8 million). What contributed to the film's success? Despite spending years in supporting roles and gaining fame for his comedic performance in the cult US sitcom Parks and Recreation, Chris Pratt has become one of Hollywood's most reliable stars over the past year. He appeared in two of 2014's top five highest-grossing films at the US box office: The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. With a blend of charm, vulnerability, and humor, Pratt manages to bring humanity to even the most special-effects-heavy blockbusters. This talent was evident in Marvel's Guardians, where his co-stars were a talking raccoon and a giant animated tree\u2014yet the film unexpectedly grossed $774 million (\u00a3499 million) worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2014. Pratt\u2019s appearance certainly doesn't detract from his appeal. China, the world\u2019s second-largest film market after the US, restricts foreign film screenings to 34 a year. This makes it crucial for Hollywood blockbusters to secure a spot on that list to significantly boost box office earnings. Unlike most Hollywood films, which don't release in China at the same time as in the US, Jurassic World debuted simultaneously in both regions. It opened in a total of 66 international markets, earning $307.2 million (\u00a3198 million), with China contributing $100.8 million (\u00a365 million)\u2014almost 20% of the global total. When the original Jurassic Park was released, IMAX screens were rare, typically showing short films, documentaries, and theme park features. Now, with about 800 IMAX screens worldwide, the chance to see dinosaurs larger than life is a major draw. The option to watch a T-Rex in 3D has led audiences to pay premium prices for the added spectacle, boosting box office revenues. According to Rentrak, a box office analyst, nearly 50% of Jurassic World's US earnings came from 3D showings. Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park holds a nostalgic place for many moviegoers.

{"id": "xsum_37617379", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "If you have eaten a handful of spicy chicken wings in Angola recently or perhaps polished off a lemony \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal, there is a good chance your chicken travelled some distance before finding its way on to your plate. It depends where you live in Africa, but chickens are increasingly migrating - in freezers - from Brazil, Germany or other European Union countries to the continent. Imports of chicken to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014, according to figures from the US Department of Agriculture. Here's a look at reasons behind the huge increase and what can be done to help fatten up the continent's poultry industry - in four points: 1) Why chickens not cows? Africa has a growing population, which is projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, and with that has come an increased demand for the consumption of meat, of one variety in particular. \"Chicken is the first choice of meat for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell, chief executive of the South Africa Poultry Association. The higher cost of beef and some of the religious restrictions around pork in parts of Africa help explain the preference for chicken, he says. As more people move to the city, their dietary patterns begin to change and they are more likely to choose meat from a local fast food joint, or one of the global chains that have proliferated across the continent in recent years. The fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken now has more than 700 outlets in Africa, operating in 13 countries. \"The production of meat has not caught up with the demand... driven both by the rise in the population but also by the urbanisation phenomenon,\" explains Calestous Juma, a professor of International Development at Harvard University. And the growth really is phenomenal. By 2030, 50% of Africans, numbering more than half a billion, are expected to be living in cities, up from 36% in 2010, according to World Bank estimates. 2) Hungry birds Many Africans will be familiar with the \"road runner\" chicken, which can often be found in the backyard roaming freely. These birds tend to feed themselves and are known for being tough but tasty. As a means to feed the family or make a small income these low-input birds tend to do the job. However, when it comes to intensive farming, a steady supply of chicken feed which is made up of maize and soya is vital. But weak agricultural systems in Africa mean that feed often has to be imported at a high cost, hampering farmers' efforts to ramp up their grain production.", "text_ai_base": "If you've recently enjoyed a spicy chicken wing in Angola or a tangy \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal, chances are the chicken traveled quite a distance to reach your plate. Depending on your location in Africa, chickens are increasingly being imported\u2014frozen\u2014from Brazil, Germany, or other European Union countries. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, chicken imports to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014. Here are four reasons for this surge and potential strategies to boost the continent's poultry industry: 1) Why Chicken, Not Beef? Africa's population is projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, escalating the demand for meat, particularly chicken. \"Chicken is the preferred meat for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell, CEO of the South Africa Poultry Association. The high cost of beef and religious restrictions on pork in some regions contribute to this preference. As urban populations grow, people are more likely to eat at local fast-food eateries or global chains that have expanded across Africa. For instance, Kentucky Fried Chicken now boasts over 700 outlets in 13 African countries. \"Meat production hasn't kept pace with the surge in demand, driven by both population growth and urbanization,\" explains Calestous Juma, a professor of International Development at Harvard University. This trend is remarkable. By 2030, an estimated 50% of Africans\u2014more than half a billion people\u2014are expected to live in urban areas, up from 36% in 2010, according to World Bank estimates. 2) Feeding the Birds Many Africans know the \"road runner\" chicken, often found freely roaming backyards. These birds, known for being tough yet flavorful, typically fend for themselves and provide sustenance or a small income with minimal input. However, intensive farming requires a steady supply of chicken feed, mostly comprising maize and soy. Africa's weak agricultural systems mean feed often has to be imported at high costs, hindering farmers' ability to scale up grain production.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "If you have recently indulged in the spicy chicken wing in Angola or the tangy \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal, the chances are that the chicken has been hauled over thousands of miles to reach your plate.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, chicken imports to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014. Below are four reasons for the influx and how the continent may boost the poultry industry: 1) Why chicken and not beef? Africa's population is on track to double by 2050 and reach 2.5 billion by mid-century. As that figure rises, so does demand for meat, and especially chicken. \"It is the meat of choice for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell, the CEO of the South Africa Poultry Association. An expensive cattle industry and restrictions on pork due to religious reasons in some parts of the continent make chicken stand out. Once they move to the cities, people prefer not to prepare their own food, relying instead on local fast-food joints or global brands that have made their way into Africa. Kentucky Fried Chicken, for example, now has more than 700 branches spanning 13 of Africa's countries. \"Meat production has lagged behind the increase in demand brought about not just by rising population, but urbanization as well,\" Calestous Juma, a Professor of the Practice of International Development at Harvard University said.

Tough, but tasty, it scavenges for food and offers some food and potentially income with minimal input.

An Ofcom spokesman responded: \"To suggest that the delay has been caused by anything other than litigation - and the threat of litigation - on behalf of competing companies is inaccurate.\" Previously O2 and Vodafone had expressed anger that rival network EE - formerly known as Everything Everywhere - had been given permission to use its existing 1,800MHz spectrum to launch a 4G service earlier.

The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve?

This play focuses on the all-American couple, Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War II. The director, Michael Buffong, shares with arts correspondent Tim Masters why this play is a 20th-century classic. On taking \"All My Sons\" on tour during Arthur Miller's centenary, Buffong notes that this milestone draws extra attention to an exceptional piece of work by an extraordinary writer. Although the tour coincides with the centenary, it was unplanned but fortuitous. What makes \"All My Sons\" an American classic? Its themes are universal, delving into the pursuit of the American dream, and the costs associated with it. The play explores loyalty, trust, betrayal, family secrets, and the collapse of illusions when truths surface. Joe Keller, driven by familial loyalty, believes actions are justified if done for family, ignoring broader social responsibilities\u2014this is his downfall. The 2013 production received five-star reviews; does this add pressure to the current tour? Buffong admits he hasn't dwelled on it, as overthinking might disrupt his sleep. Reviews, both positive and negative, are an inseparable part of theater. How much is being adjusted this time? Revisiting a fantastic play reveals new depths. With half of the cast being new, fresh elements are naturally introduced, showcasing the text's enduring richness. Does a black cast offer a new perspective? It adds nuance, especially when considering a black family striving for the American dream, amplifying the stakes given black history in the US.

Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers? Alun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020. (Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020).

Ms Merill said she does not accept the emails' content is \"factually correct\". Dr Rucinski said he has been \"instructed not to comment.\" The organisation describes itself as the \"independent voice of patients\" in Wales. It and the seven CHCs it oversees had an annual budget in 2015-16 of \u00c2\u00a33.8m. Dr Rucinski was appointed as chief executive of the Board of Community Health Councils in a newly-created role in July 2015. At the time, he told BBC Wales that he had been \"put in place to make things happen\". He said he wanted CHCs to become a \"much more proactive and effective patient voice\". Four months later the Welsh Government appointed Ms Merrill as the board's new chair. Dr Rucinski was then suspended in February 2016. Several sources have told BBC Wales that there was tension between Mr Rucinski and Ms Merrill prior to his suspension. In emails written to Ms Merrill before his suspension, obtained by BBC Wales, Mr Rucinski raises concerns about being stopped from doing interviews on a Welsh Government digital health initiative in December 2015 and on a report by the OECD think tank comparing UK health services in February 2016. In the emails Dr Rucinski stated that his job description involved doing media interviews and suggested he felt Ms Merill's instructions to him not to do interviews may have been influenced by a meeting with a Welsh Government minister. He wrote: \"I am genuinely concerned about the comments you have relayed from your meeting with the minister.\" Following his suspension, a board meeting was held in which Ms Merrill appears to try to explain the disagreement over media coverage between her and the chief executive. The minutes state that Ms Merrill said a \"media embargo\" had \"only been imposed on the chief executive regarding this one news item [the OECD story]\", and \"it was noted that there was some context behind this decision which could not be shared, however the board chair had required the chief executive to provide a briefing prior to the commenting on any issue in order to decide the best approach and deliver the message to the media\". \"A conversation regarding a need for a media protocol had been discussed with the chief executive,\" the minutes said. The document also said that the chief executive had shared a text message from Ms Merrill with staff \"without her knowledge and without context of previous discussions\".", "text_ai_base": "The Board of Community Health Councils (CHCs) is remaining silent on the reason for chief executive Tony Rucinski's suspension.

Publication of Gowling's report had been delayed after legal action by \"one of the parties named\", the council said, but was published on Friday \"in the public interest\". Documents leaked to the BBC earlier had shed light on its findings. The authority's chief executive Jan Britton said the \"next step\" was to refer allegations to its internal disciplinary watchdog- the standards committee - to consider. Mr Britton said a review would take place to \"tighten up council procedures on land sales\" and it would \"consider if any disciplinary action against employees was required.\" The allegations set out in the report include: Former economy chief councillor Mr Jones and Mr Hussain stood down from the ruling cabinet after investigations began, but both had their suspensions from the Labour party lifted before elections on 5 May. Mr Hussain has now been suspended afresh, the party confirmed. Tipton Green ward councillor Mr Jones, whom the report said faced no misconduct issue, said he was \"pleased\" to see the report published and with those conclusions. He added: \"Throughout this matter I have always protested my innocence of any wrongdoing and I have always fully co-operated with all investigations.\" Oldbury ward councillor Mr Hussain gave evidence to the report that he did not know who was buying the toilet blocks because the purchase was through a company name, not the name of his friend. He said he had not been consulted and had not been aware of the price. Mr Hafeez, who was arrested last year, provided no evidence despite requests, the report said. He has not yet responded to further questions from the BBC. Police told him in November 2015 he would face no action. He said in November his arrest \"did not relate to the sale or purchase of any former Sandwell Council properties\" and he was \"considering taking legal action against a number of individuals and organisations\".

Gowling focused on sales from 2011 to 2013, which included three old public toilet blocks and a former coroner's office in Smethwick.

Tipton Green ward councillor Mr. Jones, who was cleared of misconduct, expressed satisfaction with the report's release and conclusions. He stated, \"I've consistently asserted my innocence and fully cooperated with all investigations.\" Oldbury ward councillor Mr. Hussain explained he was unaware of the toilet blocks' buyers because purchases occurred under a company name rather than his friend's name. He claimed ignorance about the transactions and their pricing. Despite requests, Mr. Hafeez, who was arrested last year, presented no evidence, per the report. He has not responded to further BBC inquiries. Police informed him in November 2015 that no action would be taken against him. Mr. Hafeez mentioned then that his arrest was unrelated to any Sandwell Council property sales and was contemplating legal action against various people and organizations.

Figures obtained by the BBC show more than 4,000 cases since 2013 where children have taken explicit pictures of themselves and sent them to others. It is illegal to possess, take or distribute sexual images of someone who is under 18, including of yourself. The five-year-old, from County Durham, was spoken to by officers of Durham Constabulary last year. He is the youngest person to be investigated for sexting by police forces in England and Wales who responded to a BBC Newcastle request for information. The force's DCI Steve Thubron said sexting issues were dealt with on a case by case basis, with a focus on safeguarding children. He said incidents were recorded in line with national crime recording standards. \"We deal with incidents proportionately and obviously do not criminalise children,\" he said. \"We have worked with other agencies to provide advice and guidance to both schoolteachers and young people. \"We would urge any children who are worried to speak with a trusted adult or call 101.\" The most common age of those involved in sexting is 13 or 14. A 10-year-old boy - only just at the age of criminal responsibility - has been cautioned by Northumbria Police for sexting. The boy sent a sexual image of himself to an 11-year-old child using Oovoo - a free social media video and image sharing app. Greater Manchester Police recorded the highest number of child sexters with 695 cases looked into - including four seven-year-olds and four eight-year-olds. Even if a child isn't prosecuted for sending, distributing or possessing an indecent image or video, once it has been sent, it is no longer in the sender's control. If the content is then posted on a public social media page, it could be viewed by friends and family, or potential employers. Many children have spoken of instances where an image has been shared with a girlfriend or boyfriend, only for the image to then be circulated more widely. Kerry Smith of Plan International UK, which works for children's rights, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: \"Girls are being pressured - sexting is a gendered issue - more girls are being asked to share. \"There are double standards. When they do (share), the girls are shamed, not the boys who are holding the phones or the pictures or asking for them.\" She said education was key. \"People know there's an issue.

This is a direct challenge to China, which still sees the island as a province to be reunified by force if needed. What Beijing will have to decipher is where exactly Ms Tsai stands on the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty and what her next move will be. She has skilfully avoided clarifying this. She is not just a mystery to China. Many Taiwanese see her as a quiet enigmatic force, difficult to predict. She has described herself as someone who likes to walk next to walls to avoid the spotlight and characterised her rapid ascendency in politics as an \"accidental life\". Why does this election matter? Is it all about the economy? What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Ms Tsai is Taiwan's first female leader but unlike other Asian women who rose to the top, she didn't come from a political family.

She spent the first 30 years of her life deep in academic pursuits: getting a bachelor of law at National Taiwan University, a master's in law at Cornell University in the US and a PhD at the London School of Economics, eventually becoming a law professor. Her area of expertise and English proficiency meant she was called upon in the 1990s to become a legal consultant for Taiwan's World Trade Organization (WTO) entry negotiations. So began her entry into public life. As national security advisor to former President Lee Teng-hui, she helped draft his special state-to-state relations doctrine, in which he defined relations between Beijing and Taipei as that of two countries - a move that angered China. But under the next president Chen Shui-bian and at one of the worst times for cross-strait relations, Ms Tsai, as head of the Mainland Affairs Council, found a way to work with a hostile China and launched the landmark \"Small Mini Links\" programme in 2001, which allowed direct ferry transport and trade links between Taiwan's outlying islands and mainland China. She later pushed for the first-ever chartered flights between the two sides. And in 2003, despite concerns about Taiwan opening up too much too soon to China, Ms Tsai convinced Mr Chen and legislators to revise Taiwan's law governing relations with China, making it legal for Taiwanese businesses to invest in the mainland.", "text_ai_base": "Having just secured Taiwan's presidency, she is unwavering in her belief that Taiwan's future should be determined by its own people.

He warned that the NHS faces a potential collapse without an urgent influx of funds. Though the plans have not yet become party policy and won't be presented at this year's conference in Bournemouth, Mr. Lamb, the party's health spokesperson, expressed great interest in an exclusive NHS and care contribution, distinctly separate from other taxes and visible on payslips. He is also keen on allowing local areas to raise additional funds for the NHS and care services if they choose. The Liberal Democrats aim to implement these ideas across the UK; however, as health and social care are devolved issues, it's uncertain how enforcement would occur. Mr. Lamb, who was defeated by Tim Farron in the leadership election in July, suggests forming a cross-party commission to explore these concepts. He plans to consult with health organizations, professionals, patients, trade unions, and academics. While ministers have pledged \u00a32 billion for the NHS this financial year, with an additional \u00a38 billion by 2020, Mr. Lamb told the BBC that this is inadequate, warning of a potential \u00a330 billion funding gap by 2020 unless more investment is made due to the growing demand from an aging population.

Sepsis is triggered by infections and causes around 37,000 deaths a year in the UK. NHS England says hospitals should work together to tackle the problem. Sepsis usually develops from blood poisoning and involves a dramatic reaction by the body's immune system. If not treated quickly it can lead to organ failure or death. Early symptoms can include a high temperature and a fast heartbeat. The Intensive Care Society recently launched a campaign to raise awareness of sepsis to avoid what it says are thousands of preventable deaths. There are 37,000 deaths a year in the UK because of sepsis, compared with just more than 35,000 from lung cancer and 16,000 from bowel cancer. The society, along with the UK Sepsis Trust, argues that there is inadequate recording of sepsis cases by hospitals and insufficient knowledge of the steps required to recognise and treat it early. Julie Bignone nearly died because of sepsis and spent seven weeks in hospital - some of them in a critical condition. Feeling feverish, she assumed she had a bad dose of flu. After a weekend in bed, she went to her GP and was told to come back if her condition worsened and antibiotics would be prescribed. But later that day, with her family growing more anxious she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Julie was found to have pneumonia in both lungs and sepsis and doctors feared she might not survive. She only pulled through after several weeks in intensive care and heavy doses of antibiotics. She feels now that she should have acted on her instinct early on that she was suffering from something a lot worse than flu. Julie says: \"There's a lot of scope for getting it wrong with sepsis because the symptoms are not specific enough - we need to get a system where doctors listen to patients more and allow them to have more of an opinion\". Prof Bellamy, who is based at the Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, said: \"For the first time this year I have had a couple patients for whom we had no effective antibiotic treatment, it's rare - but two years ago it would still have been regarded as a theoretical problem.\" He says it is crucial to raise the profile of sepsis, and to ensure it is tackled early to give the patient the best chance of survival.

The Football Association is awaiting Taylor's report before deciding if disciplinary action is necessary. Previously, George Boyd received a three-match ban for spitting at Manchester City\u2019s Joe Hart. However, current FA guidelines mandate that offenses of this nature now warrant a six-match ban. Cisse's penalty might be harsher because he was sent off in December for elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman, which could add an extra one-match suspension according to FA rules. Several former players think Evans and Cisse deserve punishment. Dietmar Hamann, ex-Newcastle midfielder, called the behavior \"unacceptable\" and \"disgusting,\" while Phil Neville, former Manchester United defender, stated that both players should feel embarrassed. Speaking on BBC\u2019s Match of the Day, Hamann emphasized the negative influence on young viewers and the weekly decline in player conduct toward each other and officials. Jermaine Jenas, another former Newcastle player, voiced his disgust on BBC Radio 5 live, asserting the game does not need such actions. TV replays indicate that Evans spat at Cisse, who was on the ground, and Cisse appeared to retaliate in kind. Neither Newcastle manager John Carver nor Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal witnessed the incident. Carver, whose team lost 1-0, stated, \"I can't comment on it. I just know there was a fracas on the halfway line.\" Van Gaal remarked, \"I don\u2019t think Jonny Evans is a spitter.

Lavish parties with live bands are not unusual and girls traditionally wear puffy dresses, tiaras and make-up as they are \"queen for the day\". It is not clear why this particular video went viral and was shared more than 800,000 times and prompted countless memes and imitations. Mr Ibarra said in a TV interview he had no idea what had caught the public's imagination. \"We wanted to invite the people from the area, that's all,\" he said, before denying he had since uninvited all but personal acquaintances. Mr Ibarra said that when he found out about the mass interest in their daughter's party and how some had poked fun at their rural ways he had been \"sad\" for two days but that the family had now got used to the idea and that the party would go ahead in a field outside the village of La Joya, in the state of San Luis Potosi. Ms Garcia said: \"Rubi is my daughter and she has always been our queen\", before describing her favourite meme so far. \"It's the one about Donald Trump and [Mexican President} Enrique Pena Nieto coming to an agreement to allow undocumented Mexican migrants in the US to return to Mexico for Rubi's party.\" Local lawmaker Roberto Alejandro Segovia Hernandez said police would be deployed to the village and the roads leading to it to ensure safety in case the crowds who said on Facebook they would attend really did descend on La Joya.

Crescencio Ibarra, the father, initially intended to invite only neighbors and friends to the event which features local bands, a meal, and a horse race.

We invite you to our daughter Rubi Ibarra Garcia's 15th birthday party on December 26th,\" he says as Rubi smiles.

The 5,017 days of detention were not only a real point of tension in the critical transatlantic relationship; they also soured and compromised attempts by the government to reach out to some of the hardest-to-reach Muslim communities. In the short term, he will begin to receive expert medical help, including a psychiatric assessment. He will finally get to meet the son who was born on the day he arrived at Guantanamo Bay. But for some, Mr Aamer's return represents a risk. Davis Lewin, of the Henry Jackson Society, a security and foreign relations think tank, has urged the UK to think very carefully about how it manages and monitors him now he is back. Mr Aamer's legal team have said he will submit to whatever monitoring is required - although they also argue it is unnecessary because the case against him comes from unreliable allegations extracted during torture. If MI5 decides to monitor him, he may never know for sure that it is happening - such is the nature of that kind of work. There are bigger questions for the UK, questions of legacy and lessons to be learnt. Critics argue that in the wake of 9/11 the US was not the only country to lose its legal map and moral compass. London didn't seem to want to tell Washington that Guantanamo was a bad idea - and it didn't insist that any British men detained in Afghanistan be brought back to the UK. That, say critics, was a dereliction of long-standing British principles of justice. \"Human rights and justice and the rule of law are for everybody,\" says former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, a member of the cross-party group that lobbied Washington to release Mr Aamer. \"He has been denied that. Not only is that terrible for him, but we have to be better than that if we're going to defeat the scourge of terror and terrorism. \"We're going to have to rise above these things and stick to the rule of law, and accept that human rights belong to everyone.\" Some American interrogations involved intelligence material provided by Britain - and that could amount to complicity in torture. And so, many MPs are now pushing for real answers to questions about Britain's role in the weeks and months after 9/11. \"One of the things that it is absolutely essential that happens in due course is that [Shaker Aamer] looks the camera in the eye in Britain and says what happened to him,\" says Mr Mitchell.", "text_ai_base": "Regardless of one's views regarding Mr. Aamer, his return to the UK was widely welcomed across Whitehall as a relief.

His legal team has stated he will comply with necessary monitoring, although they contend it's unwarranted, as the allegations against him were obtained through torture. If MI5 opts to monitor him, he might never be aware of it, given the covert nature of such work. Larger questions loom for the UK concerning legacy and lessons learned. Critics assert that post-9/11, the US wasn't alone in losing its legal and moral bearings. London's reluctance to advise Washington against Guantanamo and failure to demand the return of British detainees from Afghanistan was, according to critics, a neglect of Britain's justice principles. \"Human rights and justice and the rule of law are universal,\" states former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, part of the group lobbying for Mr. Aamer's release. \"He's been denied these rights. It's terrible for him, and we must uphold these principles to combat terror.

The government remains fully committed to maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent as the ultimate guarantee of security for a nuclear nation.\u201d Responding to Corbyn\u2019s criticism the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, said: \u201cThis is hypocrisy of the highest order from Jeremy Corbyn, because he has clearly made his views on Trident extremely public.

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, later called on the defence secretary to take action\u2002against Sir Nicholas over the remarks. \u201cIt is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has intervened directly in issues of political dispute. It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times,\u201d he said. \u201cBy publicly taking sides in current political arguments, and in issues of party-political controversy, Sir Nicholas has clearly breached that constitutional principle. I am therefore writing to Michael Fallon to ask him to take action on this matter and to remind Sir Nicholas and all other military personnel of the importance of avoiding any appearance of political involvement in our national debate.\u201d Corbyn, a long-standing vice president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), clashed with members of his shadow cabinet at the Labour conference in Brighton when he said he would never press the nuclear button. He welcomed the opposition of Labour in Scotland to the UK\u2019s Trident weapons system, and describing it as an \u201cissue of immense importance for the whole country\u201d.

He believes the idea of nuclear weapons \u201cfor some nations to be able to inflict enormous violence, mass murder and spread destruction on a huge scale is utterly repugnant\u201d. Asked about Corbyn ruling out the possibility of using nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas told Marr: \u201cWell, it would worry me if that thought was translated into power.\u201d Sir Nicholas told Marr that \u201csubmarine-based strategic nuclear deterrence\u201d provided the \u201cultimate guarantee\u201d of the UK\u2019s safety. \u201cIf a prime minister said they would never press the button, we would have to admit to any potential aggressor that the deterrent simply doesn\u2019t work \u2013 it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. The operational success of deterrence \u201crelies upon credibility\u201d, he added. \u201cThe whole thing about deterrence comes from the idea of deterrent of the worst case, that you have to have a degree of credibility about the ability to use these things.\u201d He added: \u201cThe reason we have a nuclear deterrent is because we can\u2019t predict how the international scene is going to evolve in the 15 to 20 years necessary to renew Trident ... I can absolutely understand why people would have little time for Trident if they were certain that the way the future will evolve poses little threat.\u201d Trident nuclear deterrent vital, says senior diplomat in leaked letter Read more The In an apparent acknowledgement of the potential delicacy in commenting, Sir Nicholas admitted that \u201cpoliticians get themselves into all sorts of messes\u201d suggesting that \u201ccertainty\u201d about Trident is the \u201creality that they confront when they are in power\u201d. At a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency after Remembrance Sunday national commemorations at the Cenotaph, Corbyn said: \u201cI think [Sir Nicholas\u2019s remarks] were kind of unhelpful. I think he was overstepping his role.\u201d Interviewed on Channel 4 News, Corbyn had some words of advice for Sir Nicholas: \u201cI ask him to recognise that in a democracy, it is the elected political leadership that makes the decisions. I will be asking for the defence secretary to have a discussion with him \u2026 If he wants a discussion with me, that is fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should not seek to intervene by expressing them in public.\u201d Additional reporting by Toby Helm and Mark Townsend Contributors: Andrew Sparrow (AndrewSparrow), Peter Walker (peterwalker99) and Matthew Weaver (matthew_weaver) Topics Jeremy Corbyn Nuclear weapons Trident Armed forces Conservatives Labour party Defence news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View comments Responding to the remarks, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The government's position on the nuclear deterrent is clear - it will remain in use for as long as necessary. \"We expect members of the armed forces to advise on the operational security of our nuclear deterrent\" \"We can confirm that Jeremy Corbyn has written to the Defence Secretary.

After the burglary, the Met Police launched an investigation into why after police were made aware an intruder alarm had gone off at the scene of the raid it was decided the alarm did not require a response.
