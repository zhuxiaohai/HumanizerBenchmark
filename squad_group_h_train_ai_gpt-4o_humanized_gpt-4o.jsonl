In the third game, despite leading into the ninth inning, when a win felt tantalizingly close, disaster struck. Willie Stargell launched a last-ditch, two-out, two-strike missile off the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, sending the ball onto Sheffield Avenue and knotting up the score. They ended up dropping that game 7-5 in extra innings. Now reeling on a four-game losing slope, the Cubs headed to Shea Stadium for what turned into a nightmare\u2014a two-game sweep by the Mets.\n\nThis sequence left Chicago at 84-58, with their lead now whittled down to a mere half-game. As if scripted by the baseball gods, their bad luck followed them to Philadelphia, where the Phillies, a team destined for 99 losses, twice stole victories from them. One particularly crushing moment occurred in the second game on September 11, when pitcher Dick Selma made a dubious pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who, unfortunately, had drifted too far from the bag, resulting in a throwing error that ultimately ignited a Phillies' rally. By the end of this debacle, the Cubs stood at 84-60. Meanwhile, the Mets had surged ahead to 85-57 and stayed untouchable after that.\n\nThe Cubs managed to stop the bleeding briefly in St. Louis, but elsewhere, the Mets were ripping off a ten-game winning streak. Exhaustion seemed to set in for the Cubs as they struggled on all fronts. Remarkably, the Mets, who had infamously lost 120 games just seven years prior, rode this momentum straight to a World Series triumph. The Cubs wrapped up their season with a still-respectable 92-70 record. Still, they're often remembered for watching their division lead evaporate, as they lost a daunting 17\u00bd games to the unstoppable Mets as the season drew to a close.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765432776, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4a331a0222", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 604, "prompt_tokens": 658, "total_tokens": 1262, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}}, "humanizer_error": null}

In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD.

Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal.", "text_ai_base": "Sleep does not impact the acquisition or recall of memories while we are awake; instead, its greatest influence is on memory consolidation.

The book\u2019s opening line, borrowed from 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb\u2014\"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once\"\u2014sets a tone that resonates throughout the story, highlighting how even the youthful antics of Scout and Jem reflect aspects of legal negotiation.

Mr. Dolphus Raymond, for instance, finds himself on the fringes of society\u2014his choice to live with a black partner and raise interracial children earns him scorn and ostracism.

John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy.

The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard.

Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in Hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and Catch Me If You Can (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim.

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is\u2014in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention.

In contrast, less restrictive cultures may allow more freedom for adolescent sexual expression and interaction between genders in both public and private settings.

After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award. After a down-to-the-wire Wild Card chase with the San Francisco Giants, Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field in which third baseman Gary Gaetti hit the eventual game winning homer. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90\u201373 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager Jim Riggleman's club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by Atlanta. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey, Jr. helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the 1994 strike. The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town White Sox in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.", "text_ai_base": "The 1998 season began on a somber note with the passing of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray.

The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used.

In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities.

Sperling observes that the Ming were involved in purchasing horses from the Kham region simultaneously as they battled Tibetan tribes in Amdo, while also graciously receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Despite these limitations, Tibetans were keen to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming, as the imperial patronage brought them wealth and sway. And why wouldn't they? According to Laird, Tibetans were motivated to seek invitations to the Ming court because the gifts they received for their tribute were far more valuable than the tribute itself.\n\nOn the subject of opulent gifts, Tsai highlights how the Yongle Emperor bestowed upon his Tibetan and Nepalese vassals items like silver wares, Buddha relics, temple utensils, and monks' robes.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410.

In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.", "text_ai_base": "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar, the U.S. dollar is structured on a decimal system.

The historian Kalhana, in his *Rajatarangini*, credits Lalitaditya with leading an aggressive military campaign across Northern India and Central Asia. He advanced into the Uttarapatha, defeating tribes such as the Kambojas, Tukharas (Turks in Turkmenistan and Tocharians in Badakhshan), Bhautas (Tibetans in Baltistan and Tibet), and Daradas (Dards). His conquests continued as he subjugated the kingdoms of Pragjyotisha, Strirajya, and the Uttarakurus.

By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14\u221217-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15\u201344 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence.

Sasha Fierce* dropped, it hit the ground running, selling a staggering 482,000 copies in its debut week. This impressive start secured the album the top spot on the Billboard 200, reinforcing Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s streak of chart-topping success with her third consecutive U.S. number-one album. Packed with hits, the album featured chart-toppers like \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and high-ranking tracks such as \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo.\" In fact, \"Halo\" proved to be a standout, clinching Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s record for the longest-running Hot 100 single and solidifying her status with more top-ten singles in the 2000s than any other female artist. That's no small feat!\n\nAs the world soaked up Beyonc\u00e9's music, other tracks from the album also caught fire\u2014hits like \"Sweet Dreams\" and irresistible singles such as \"Diva,\" \"Ego,\" \"Broken-Hearted Girl,\" and \"Video Phone\" kept fans dancing. However, the music video for \"Single Ladies\" became a global phenomenon, igniting what the Toronto Star famously dubbed the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age. Garnering awards left and right, the video snagged Best Video accolades at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the Scottish MOBO Awards, and the BET Awards.\n\nThe 2009 MTV Video Music Awards highlighted the video\u2019s success even further with a whopping nine nominations and three wins\u2014including Video of the Year. Yet, the ceremony didn\u2019t pass without drama. Beyonc\u00e9's video lost Best Female Video to Taylor Swift's \"You Belong with Me,\" sparking Kanye West\u2019s notorious stage invasion. Amid the turmoil, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s grace shone through when she graciously used her acceptance speech moment to allow Swift a second chance at the podium.\n\nAs if the year wasn\u2019t eventful enough, March 2009 ushered in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s electrifying I Am... World Tour. This marked her second solo endeavor across the globe, sprawling across 108 shows and pulling in a jaw-dropping $119.5 million.

In a striking display, the BBC described the torch as being enveloped by a \"mobile protective ring\" during its journey through London. \n\nProtests erupted right out of the gate as Redgrave set the relay in motion, culminating in the arrest of at least thirty-five individuals. A tense moment unfolded in Ladbroke Grove when a protester tussled with Huq over the torch, and a fire extinguisher went off nearby, adding to the chaos. The Chinese ambassador then took up the torch in Chinatown, thanks to a last-minute change in plans driven by security concerns. In a move to dodge the wave of protestors, the torch was whisked onto a bus along Fleet Street. The pro-Tibet protests elicited a strong response from more than 2,000 Chinese supporters lining the relay path, proudly wielding signs, banners, and Chinese flags in a fervent show of support for the Beijing Olympics of 2008.

The years leading up to the conquest increased the number of Han Chinese under Manchu rule, leading Hong Taiji to create the Eight Han Banners (zh), and around the time of the Qing takeover of Beijing, their numbers rapidly swelled. Han Bannermen held high status and power in the early Qing period, especially immediately after the conquest during Shunzhi and Kangxi's reign where they dominated Governor-Generalships and Governorships across China at the expense of both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians. Han also numerically dominated the Banners up until the mid 18th century. European visitors in Beijing called them \"Tartarized Chinese\" or \"Tartarified Chinese\". It was in Qianlong's reign that the Qianlong Emperor, concerned about maintaining Manchu identity, re-emphasized Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture in the Eight Banners and started a mass discharge of Han Bannermen from the Eight Banners, either asking them to voluntarily resign from the Banner rolls or striking their names off. This led to a change from Han majority to a Manchu majority within the Banner system, and previous Han Bannermen garrisons in southern China such as at Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen in the purge, which started in 1754. The turnover by Qianlong most heavily impacted Han banner garrisons stationed in the provinces while it less impacted Han Bannermen in Beijing, leaving a larger proportion of remaining Han Bannermen in Beijing than the provinces. Han Bannermen's status was decreased from that point on with Manchu Banners gaining higher status. Han Bannermen numbered 75% in 1648 Shunzhi's reign, 72% in 1723 Yongzheng's reign, but decreased to 43% in 1796 during the first year of Jiaqing's reign, which was after Qianlong's purge. The mass discharge was known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners (zh). Qianlong directed most of his ire at those Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after the Qing passed through the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, deeming their ancestors as traitors to the Ming and therefore untrustworthy, while retaining Han Bannermen who were descended from defectors who joined the Qing before 1644 in Liaodong and marched through Shanhai pass, also known as those who \"followed the Dragon through the pass\" (\u5f9e\u9f8d\u5165\u95dc; cong long ru guan).", "text_ai_base": "The Banner Armies of the Qing dynasty were structured based on ethnic lines, primarily consisting of Manchu and Mongol groups, but they also included non-Manchu bondservants registered under their Manchu masters' households. As the Qing approached their conquest, the number of Han Chinese under Manchu rule grew significantly. To address this, Hong Taiji established the Eight Han Banners. Around the time of the Qing's capture of Beijing, the Han Chinese numbers in these Banners rapidly increased. In the early Qing period, particularly during the reigns of Shunzhi and Kangxi, Han Bannermen held significant status and power, often dominating positions such as Governor-Generalships and Governorships, overshadowing both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians. The Han outnumbered other groups within the Banners until the mid-18th century. European visitors in Beijing referred to them as \"Tartarized Chinese\" or \"Tartarified Chinese.\" During Emperor Qianlong's reign, concerned about preserving Manchu identity, there was a renewed focus on Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture within the Eight Banners. This led to a large-scale removal of Han Bannermen, beginning in 1754, with many being asked to resign or having their names removed from the Banner rolls. Consequently, the Banner system shifted from a Han majority to a Manchu majority. Han garrisons in southern China, such as those in Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, and Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen. The turnover severely affected provincial Han Banner garrisons but had less impact on those in Beijing, where a higher proportion of Han Bannermen remained. From this period onward, the status of Han Bannermen diminished as Manchu Banners rose in prominence. During Shunzhi's reign in 1648, 75% of Bannermen were Han, which dropped to 72% in 1723 during Yongzheng's reign, and further to 43% in 1796, at the start of Jiaqing's reign after Qianlong's purge, known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners. Qianlong specifically targeted Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after they breached the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, viewing them as traitors to the Ming and distrustful. However, he retained those descended from defectors who joined the Qing prior to 1644 in Liaodong and participated in the passage through Shanhai Pass, who were known as those who \"followed the Dragon through the pass.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false, "text_ai_humanized": "The Banner Armies under the Qing dynasty featured a system organized along ethnic lines, predominantly composed of Manchu and Mongol contingents.

To accommodate this influx, Hong Taiji took the pivotal step of forming the Eight Han Banners. By the time the Qing forces successfully took Beijing, the Han populations within these Banners multiplied at an astonishing pace. During the nascent years of the Qing, particularly under the rule of emperors Shunzhi and Kangxi, Han Bannermen not only held considerable influence but also frequently occupied key governmental roles such as governor-generalships and governorships.

Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran.

(See Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea, Ch\u014dsen-seibatsu (\u671d\u9bae\u5f81\u4f10?). Taking advantage of arquebus mastery and extensive wartime experience from the Sengoku period, Japanese samurai armies made major gains in most of Korea. Kato Kiyomasa advanced to Orangkai territory (present-day Manchuria) bordering Korea to the northeast and crossed the border into Manchuria, but withdrew after retaliatory attacks from the Jurchens there, as it was clear he had outpaced the rest of the Japanese invasion force. A few of the more famous samurai generals of this war were Kat\u014d Kiyomasa, Konishi Yukinaga, and Shimazu Yoshihiro. Shimazu Yoshihiro led some 7,000 samurai and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated a host of allied Ming and Korean forces at the Battle of Sacheon in 1598, near the conclusion of the campaigns. Yoshihiro was feared as Oni-Shimazu (\"Shimazu ogre\") and his nickname spread across not only Korea but to Ming Dynasty China. In spite of the superiority of Japanese land forces, ultimately the two expeditions failed (though they did devastate the Korean landmass) from factors such as Korean naval superiority (which, led by Admiral Yi Sun-shin, harassed Japanese supply lines continuously throughout the wars, resulting in supply shortages on land), the commitment of sizeable Ming forces to Korea, Korean guerrilla actions, the underestimation of resistance by Japanese commanders (in the first campaign of 1592, Korean defenses on land were caught unprepared, under-trained, and under-armed; they were rapidly overrun, with only a limited number of successfully resistant engagements against the more-experienced and battle-hardened Japanese forces - in the second campaign of 1597, Korean and Ming forces proved to be a far more difficult challenge and, with the support of continued Korean naval superiority, limited Japanese gains to parts southeastern Korea), and wavering Japanese commitment to the campaigns as the wars dragged on. The final death blow to the Japanese campaigns in Korea came with Hideyoshi's death in late 1598 and the recall of all Japanese forces in Korea by the Council of Five Elders (established by Hideyoshi to oversee the transition from his regency to that of his son Hideyori).", "text_ai_base": "In 1592 and again in 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi sought to invade China by way of Korea, deploying an army of 160,000 peasants and samurai.

Despite the Japanese army's superiority on land, both military expeditions ultimately failed for several reasons. These included the Korean navy's dominance, led by Admiral Yi Sun-shin, who disrupted Japanese supply lines, the deployment of substantial Ming forces to aid Korea, local guerrilla actions, and the Japanese commanders' misjudgment of Korean resistance. While the first 1592 campaign saw unprepared Korean land defenses overwhelmed by experienced Japanese troops, the second 1597 campaign met far stronger Korean and Ming resistance, aided by continued naval superiority, limiting Japanese gains to southeastern Korea.

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a \"blank tablet\", in Locke's words \"white paper\", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations.

Locke famously described the human mind as a tabula rasa, or a \"blank slate\"\u2014what he called \"white paper\"\u2014on which experiences from sense impressions are inscribed throughout a person's life. According to Locke, ideas arise from two sources: sensation and reflection. He further distinguished these ideas into simple and complex categories. Simple ideas are indivisible and consist of primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential to an object's identity; for instance, the atomic structure of an apple makes it an apple\u2014if altered, it would cease to be an apple.

Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion.

For instance, if your heart starts pounding at the sight of a bear in your kitchen, your brain attributes this reaction to fear of the bear.

Initially, BYU struggled to gain attention from accrediting bodies, but by the time Harris concluded his presidency, the school boasted accreditation from all the prominent organizations of the time.\n\nHarris was followed by Howard S. McDonald, who began his presidency at the aftermath of World War II. Armed with his doctorate from the University of California, McDonald faced an enrollment boom, with student numbers soaring to 5,440\u2014nearly five times more than before the war. The campus facilities were bursting at the seams, unable to handle this surge. In a bold move, McDonald acquired an old Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, converting it into much-needed student housing.\n\nThen came Ernest L. Wilkinson, whose tenure sparked unprecedented growth for BYU. He oversaw an ambitious construction spree, resulting in over eighty new buildings, many of which continue to serve the campus today. The student body grew sixfold under his leadership, making BYU a titan among private universities at that time. Not just the numbers; the quality of students saw notable enhancement, pushing the academic standards higher. Wilkinson also took strides to reorganize the on-campus LDS Church units, multiplying them with ten stakes and more than 100 wards during his term.

Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely.

He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to greatly worry the king.

Skepticism from China, France, Germany, and Russia was strong enough to block a UN Security Council resolution authorizing military action.\n\nIraq, on its part, permitted UN weapons inspectors to enter the country in November 2002. As the inspectors were busy scrutinizing the claims about WMDs, the Bush administration took matters into its own hands. Deciding to act without UN consent, they instructed the inspectors to leave, then moved forward with the invasion on March 20, 2003, supported by what was termed a \"coalition of the willing\"\u2014primarily the UK, with some degree of participation from Australia and Poland.\n\nIn a matter of three weeks, Iraq's government and military collapsed, yet no WMDs, the invasion's primary justification, were unearthed. There were discoveries of traces of old materials and some weapons labs, but nothing conclusive emerged. On May 1, President George W. Bush, standing aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, declared the end of \"major combat operations\" in what was supposed to be a moment of triumph. At that time, his approval ratings peaked at 66%, according to a CNN\u2013USA Today\u2013Gallup poll.\n\nBut the wave of high approval didn't endure. The war, initially supported by many in the United States, began to lose its luster as the months dragged on. Rising casualties and the inability to stabilize Iraq chipped away at public support. Moreover, the anticipated stockpiles of WMDs never surfaced, fueling a growing debate over whether the war had ever been justified in the first place.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765432832, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4a331a0222", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 439, "prompt_tokens": 552, "total_tokens": 991, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}}, "humanizer_error": null}

He later revised his poem The Prelude to include praise of Burke (\"Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders\") and portrayed him as an old oak. Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to have a similar conversion: he had criticised Burke in The Watchman, but in his Friend (1809\u201310) Coleridge defended Burke from charges of inconsistency. Later, in his Biographia Literaria (1817) Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring \"habitually to principles. He was a scientific statesman; and therefore a seer\". Henry Brougham wrote of Burke: \"... all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity\". George Canning believed that Burke's Reflections \"has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled\". In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Burke's \"last works and words [as] the manual of my politics\". The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli \"was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's later writings\".", "text_ai_base": "In the nineteenth century, both liberals and conservatives praised Edmund Burke. His friend Philip Francis noted that Burke \"truly and prophetically foresaw all the consequences that would arise from adopting French principles,\" yet his passionate writing led some to doubt his arguments. William Windham, speaking from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke did after his split from Fox, was described by an observer as speaking \"like the ghost of Burke\" during his 1801 speech against peace with France.

Henry Brougham noted that Burke's predictions had largely been fulfilled, highlighting the chaos and bloodshed in France, as well as the upheaval in Europe. George Canning stated that Burke's Reflections had been validated by subsequent events, with nearly every prophecy fulfilled.

They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea.

This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005).

Eddie Condon explained: \"Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development.\" The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: \"Carnegie Drag\" was 3:15; \"Carnegie Jump\", 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: \"Embraceable You\" was 4:05; \"Serenade to a Shylock\", 4:32. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record.

An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs. In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\" in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948. In popular music, this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record. One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Soliloquy\", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946.

Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem.

The day was anything but peaceful. Clashes marred the torch relay, with rocks, bottles, and punches flying between Chinese students and opposing protesters. Amid the chaos, a North Korean defector, desperate to highlight the plight of North Korean refugees at the hands of China, tried to set himself ablaze.

Meanwhile, other attempts to disrupt the relay fizzled out without note. \n\nAt the starting line, the sparks of a larger confrontation ignited. About 500 Chinese supporters squared off against a smaller, determined group of 50 protesters, who brought along a bold message: \u201cFree North Korean refugees in China.\u201d Stones and bottles sliced through the air, prompting swift intervention by roughly 2,500 police officers.

In the 20th century, the caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank, especially Caf\u00e9 de la Rotonde and Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9 in Montparnasse and Caf\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer.

Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 5). Indeed, many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity, following more or less the frameworks listed above, rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality. In this environment, some analysts, such as Brubaker and Cooper, have suggested doing away with the concept completely (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 1). Others, by contrast, have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression.

As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city. Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government.

However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction.", "text_ai_base": "Observing the short-term effects of a predator on its prey species can be difficult.

Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root.

Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem.

He proposed the parton model to explain strong interactions in nucleon scattering, complementing the quark model advanced by his Caltech colleague, Murray Gell-Mann. The connection between the two models was unclear, with Gell-Mann mockingly calling Feynman's partons \"put-ons.\" During the mid-1960s, many physicists considered quarks mere tools for tracking symmetry, not actual particles. This skepticism arose because the Omega-minus particle, if viewed as a bound state of three identical strange quarks, seemed theoretically impossible. However, experiments at the Stanford linear accelerator in the late 1960s, similar to Rutherford's 1911 alpha particle gold nucleus scattering, revealed that nucleons had point-like particles scattering electrons. These were naturally identified as quarks, yet Feynman's parton model aimed to interpret the findings without new hypotheses. The data indicated that about 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles within the nucleon. Today, we recognize these particles as gluons, which mediate forces between quarks and carry a three-valued color charge that resolves the Omega-minus issue.

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi). Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Arm\u00e9e performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions. The Ulm Maneuver completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off. After some minor engagements that culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement.

Facing the threat of invasion from his continental adversaries, he opted for a preemptive strike and redirected his army's focus from the English Channel to the Rhine. His primary goal was to defeat the isolated Austrian forces in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could intervene. On September 25, under great secrecy and with intense marching, 200,000 French troops began crossing the Rhine along a 260 km (160 mi) front. Austrian commander Karl Mack had concentrated most of the Austrian army at Ulm fortress in Swabia. Napoleon maneuvered his forces southeast, executing a complex wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions. This Ulm Maneuver completely caught General Mack off guard, and he realized too late that his army was surrounded. Following several minor skirmishes, which culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack surrendered upon recognizing the impossibility of breaking through the French encirclement. With only 2,000 French casualties, Napoleon captured 60,000 Austrian soldiers, owing to the swift marching of his army. The Ulm Campaign is widely seen as a strategic masterpiece and influenced the development of the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century.

After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that \"property is theft\") used the word \"humanism\" to describe a \"culte, d\u00e9ification de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\" (\"worship, deification of humanity\") and Ernest Renan in L\u2019avenir de la science: pens\u00e9es de 1848 (\"The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848\") (1848\u201349), states: \"It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity\u2014all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value.\"", "text_ai_base": "In the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, the term \"humanism\" began to be used with a more ideological connotation.

Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related \u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant \u2014 the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact.

The twist came during the unification of Castile and Aragon, bringing a Spanish-speaking elite that nested itself comfortably in the city. Fast forward to the era of Franco, and the marginalization of Valencian deepened further, overshadowing the language in public spheres.\n\nThen came 1978\u2014a pivotal year as Spain moved towards democracy. Valencian reclaimed its rightful place, regaining its official status along with newfound prestige and a spot in the educational system. Yet, as Valencia embraced industrialization, waves of immigration flooded in from other Spanish regions, slowly eroding the social fabric that was once vibrant with Valencian. This flowed into the rise of anti-Catalan blaverism, a movement that views Valencian as mere folklore, choosing to dismiss the standard orthography rooted in Catalan traditions.\n\nToday, Spanish commands the forefront in Valencia itself, with Valencians often toggling between the two languages thanks to bilingual education. It\u2019s intriguing to note that Valencia stands as the second largest Catalan-speaking city right behind Barcelona. In a testament to Valencian's enduring presence, streets and institutional buildings proudly display their names in the Valencian tongue, and the city is home to numerous political and civil groups championing Valencian causes.\n\nEducation plays its part too, with over 70 public schools dedicated to teaching in Valencian, alongside the University of Valencia offering a wide array of disciplines in the language. The city\u2019s vibrant mix of languages paints a complex picture, capturing its dynamic social and cultural landscape.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765432873, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4a331a0222", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 533, "total_tokens": 979, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Perhaps the most infamous of these were the two hold-ups orchestrated by the elusive bandit, William Whitney Brazelton. One hot summer day in 1878, Brazelton made his move, intercepting two stagecoaches near Point of Mountain Station, roughly 17 miles northwest of Tucson. Notably, among the passengers was John Clum, renowned for his future exploits in Tombstone, Arizona.\n\nBrazelton did not enjoy freedom for much longer. On Monday, August 19, 1878, his criminal escapades came to a violent end. Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell, along with his posse, tracked him down to a mesquite grove along the Santa Cruz River, about 3 miles south of Tucson, and put an end to his reign of terror. Brazelton had been a suspect in a string of other highway robberies, not only in Tucson but stretching as far as Prescott and Silver City, New Mexico. These crimes were serious enough that John J. Valentine, Sr. from Wells, Fargo & Co. dispatched Bob Paul, a special agent who would later become Pima County sheriff, to delve into the matter.\n\nAround the same era, tensions and violence continued in different quarters. Fort Lowell had been set up to shield settlers from Apache raids east of Tucson. And by 1882, another dramatic chapter unfolded when Frank Stilwell found himself a suspect in the murder of Morgan Earp. This happened after Cowboy Pete Spence's wife, Marietta, offered startling testimony at a coroner's inquest. The jurors, convinced by the evidence, pointed fingers at Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, and Florentino \"Indian Charlie\" Cruz as the chief suspects behind Earp's assassination.\n\nThe intrigue didn\u2019t end there. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp, determined to protect his kin, traveled with trusted comrades to escort his wounded brother Virgil, alongside his family, to Benson, from where they were to catch a train to California. It's here that events took an unexpected and lethal turn. They found Stilwell lurking with ill intent at the Tucson railway station, where Wyatt and his men finished him off on the tracks.\n\nThis wasn't the end of the saga.

As blood moves from venules to veins, vasodilation occurs, funneling blood back to the heart.

Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training.

These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university.

Persuading Eisenhower to enter the race required convincing him that the political climate demanded his candidacy and that there was popular support for him to become President. His campaign manager, Henry Cabot Lodge, along with others, managed to sway his decision, leading Eisenhower to resign from his NATO command in June 1952 to campaign full-time. Eisenhower eventually defeated Taft for the Republican nomination, pivotal to which was securing delegate votes from Texas.

Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons.

For example, when continental groups are sampled, the resulting clusters are continental in nature. Different sampling methods would produce different clusters.

Additionally, genomic data does not decisively determine whether one prefers subdivisions (splitters) or a continuum (lumpers). According to Kaplan and Winther, racial groupings are objective social constructs that possess biological significance only when categories are intentionally selected and constructed for scientific purposes.

Generally, some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on \"the accumulation of close parallels\", but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities.

As third party movements have learned, the Electoral College's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. Wallace had weak support outside the South.

The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\"pastoral poetry\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\" uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus.

The *Eclogues*, meaning \"selections\" in Greek, consist of ten poems inspired by the pastoral hexameter poetry of Theocritus, a Hellenistic poet. After Octavian's triumph at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC against the forces that assassinated Julius Caesar, he sought to compensate his veterans with land seized from northern Italian towns. Tradition suggests Virgil's own estate near Mantua was among these confiscated lands. As a result, it has long been believed that Virgil wrote the *Eclogues* to reclaim his lost family farm through poetic appeal, although this interpretation lacks strong evidence. In *Eclogues* 1 and 9, Virgil indeed captures the upheaval caused by land expropriations using pastoral themes but provides no definitive account of his personal experience in these events. Readers have sometimes linked the poet to his characters, whether it\u2019s the grateful elder to a new god in *Eclogue 1*, a singer\u2019s unrequited love in *Eclogue 2*, or a master singer\u2019s claim in *Eclogue 5*. However, modern scholars dismiss attempts to extract biographical facts from fiction, opting to view these characters and themes as reflections of contemporary thought and daily life. The *Eclogues* blend traditional pastoral themes with new insights. *Eclogues* 1 and 9 focus on the impact of land seizures in Italy. *Eclogues* 2 and 3 weave pastoral and erotic themes, exploring homosexual love in *Eclogue 2* and broader romantic attraction in *Eclogue 3*. In *Eclogue 4*, dedicated to Asinius Pollio and often dubbed the \"Messianic Eclogue,\" Virgil invokes imagery of a golden age tied to the birth of a child, sparking debate on the child\u2019s identity. *Eclogues* 5 and 8 recount the myth of Daphnis in a singing contest, *Eclogue 6* features the cosmic song of Silenus, *Eclogue 7* presents a fervent poetic rivalry, and *Eclogue 10* reveals the struggles of the elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus.

As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place.

By 1941, a middle ground was established: if administrators adopted procedures closely resembling the traditional legal processes of the courts, additional fact review by \"the ordinary Courts of the land\" became unwarranted.

Some eat other animals \u2013 this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores).

This era marked a creative resurgence for the band, ushered in by the release of \"Heaven and Hell\" (1980). As for Osbourne, he embarked on a solo venture and released \"Blizzard of Ozz\" (1980), spotlighting the remarkable talents of American guitarist Randy Rhoads.\n\nInterestingly, some bands took unexpected musical courses: Queen ventured away from hard rock into pop rock territory, while Rush dove back into their hard rock essence with the celebrated \"Moving Pictures\" (1981). It was around 1982 that thrash metal emerged\u2014a ferocious fusion of heavy metal and hardcore punk\u2014helmed by bands like Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. This genre crystallized extreme metal's identity, inching away from traditional hard rock, yet undeniably influenced by it.\n\nThe band Kiss decided to innovate, shedding their hallmark makeup to flirt with pop metal sounds in \"Lick It Up\" (1983) before fully embracing glam metal with \"Animalize\" in 1984, a move that reenergized their commercial appeal. Amidst these changes, Pat Benatar carved a notable niche for women in hard rock, releasing three Top 5 albums in succession between 1980 and 1982, thereby shifting the landscape of the era.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765432913, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4a331a0222", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 444, "prompt_tokens": 560, "total_tokens": 1004, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}}, "humanizer_error": null}

These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively.

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's \"pre purification\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the \"all pure seed\" of Joachim and the womb \"wider than heaven\" of St. Ann.", "text_ai_base": "The doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception emerged later among Latin theologians, especially the Franks, but found clearer expression among Byzantine theologians with roots in Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology during the Medieval Byzantine era. Poets and scholars, including Emperor Justinian I, often referred to Mary as \"prepurified\" in their writings and creeds. Sophronius of Jerusalem offered a pivotal interpretation of Nazianzen's ideas, explaining that Mary was already immaculate at the time of the Annunciation. He even suggested that John the Baptist was \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman,\" acknowledging that Mary's extraordinary holiness eclipsed even John's, who was sanctified in utero. Sophronius' teachings were further developed by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750), who praised Mary for her purification at the Annunciation and uniquely recognized her role in \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them,\" an honor traditionally reserved for Christ, according to Nazianzen's legacy. Damascene elaborated on the parallel holiness between Mary's prepurification and Jesus' purification in the New Testament, likening her holiness at the Annunciation to Christ's baptism at the Jordan. His hymns and the work \"De fide Orthodoxa\" utilized Mary's \"pre purification\" to emphasize her unparalleled holiness and pure human nature.

In the 1880s, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that \"the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.\" In 1888, Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889. The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor. The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor.

It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical, they had a very short lifetime. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' and obtained British Patent 4933 in 1880. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company.

The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels.

At the time, Britain was deeply involved in skirmishes against Napoleon's France, leading it to implement measures to thwart American trade with the French. The U.S. desired neutrality, yearning to continue its overseas commerce unabated, but Britain\u2014a bit stubborn, perhaps\u2014wasn't having it. They not only obstructed this trade but also took the controversial step of forcibly conscripting American sailors into the Royal Navy. If that weren't enough, British efforts to stir an Indian uprising in the American Midwest aimed to establish a state that would put a damper on America\u2019s relentless expansion. Things came to a head in 1812 when the United States, perhaps with more bravado than expectation, declared war on Britain, hoping against hope to stand up to the mighty Royal Navy. With some ambition, the U.S. invaded British Canada to seize territory as a bargaining chip, a strategy that fell flat on its face.\n\nHowever, the concurrent clashes with Native American tribes like the conflicts with Tecumseh and the Creek War showed brighter prospects for the U.S. Meanwhile, with Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Britain sent seasoned veterans to launch a broader offensive, hitting New York, raiding Washington, and trying to seize the strategic Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York campaign, though packed with potential, fizzled out as British forces withdrew to Canada. Their aggressive raid did result in the torching of Washington on August 25, 1814.

When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God.

One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.", "text_ai_base": "In sociology, emotions are often conceptualized as having multiple dimensions, including cultural or emotional labels like anger, pride, fear, and happiness.

But as their romance waned, she noted a change, describing him as \"insufferable, classically conceited,\" with a self-centered attitude.\n\nFast forward to 2006, and Baker introduced her personal memoir, \"Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak.\" The tone, at times, painted Schwarzenegger in less-than-flattering hues. Yet, he penned the foreword and engaged in a prolonged, three-hour conversation with her to provide input for the book. She disclosed that she only learned of his infidelity post-breakup, characterizing their relationship as both fiery and tumultuous. While Schwarzenegger admitted they might recall events differently, they undeniably shared a significant chapter of their lives.\n\nTheir story began six to eight months after Schwarzenegger's touchdown in America. One of their first dates unfolded before a television screen, as they watched the historic Apollo Moon landing. Those early years in Santa Monica were marked by the simplicity of living modestly, enjoying beach outings, and hosting backyard barbecues. Baker initially found him a bit off-putting due to his misunderstanding of polite society, but later remarked on how he exemplified the archetype of a self-made man. Despite a lack of support from those closest to him \u2014 parents or siblings \u2014 his drive to achieve was nothing short of compelling. \"I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me,\" she reflected, capturing the enduring essence of their once-shared affection.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765432952, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_4a331a0222", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 414, "prompt_tokens": 533, "total_tokens": 947, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}}, "humanizer_error": null}

Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier.

More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"against life\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist, in 1942. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host.

A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board.

Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse. A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members/directors is concerned. Beware of board-only organizations- review the board members annual income before donating, such as the Clinton Foundation.

The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956). All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a parody of the men's groups: the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and The Chattertocks of Brown University (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the Tufts University Beelzebubs and the Boston University Dear Abbeys. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including vocal percussion/\"beatboxing\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as the Georgetown Chimes' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as International Quartet Champions The Boston Common and the contemporary commercial a cappella group Rockapella.

Like Frontier, Savers has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\"Digital Accident Tactics Squad\"), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad requires the human partner's DNA (\"Digital Natural Ability\" in the English version and \"Digisoul\" in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon's attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver are not edited and used in the English dub.

You might find it intriguing how this penile structure stays hidden within the proctodeum segment of the cloaca until needed.\n\nA glance at a bird\u2019s digestive system unveils its distinctiveness: they're equipped with a crop\u2014a kind of storage pouch\u2014and a gizzard, which uses ingested stones to grind food, stepping in where teeth would otherwise do the job.

While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions.

Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents.

The small shelly fossil Cloudina, from 549 to 542 million years ago, has been classified by some authors as an annelid, but by others as a cnidarian (i.e. in the phylum to which jellyfish and sea anemones belong). Until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes Canadia and Burgessochaeta, both from Canada's Burgess Shale, formed about 505 million years ago in the early Cambrian. Myoscolex, found in Australia and a little older than the Burgess Shale, was possibly an annelid. However, it lacks some typical annelid features and has features which are not usually found in annelids and some of which are associated with other phyla. Then Simon Conway Morris and John Peel reported Phragmochaeta from Sirius Passet, about 518 million years old, and concluded that it was the oldest annelid known to date. There has been vigorous debate about whether the Burgess Shale fossil Wiwaxia was a mollusc or an annelid. Polychaetes diversified in the early Ordovician, about 488 to 474 million years ago. It is not until the early Ordovician that the first annelid jaws are found, thus the crown-group cannot have appeared before this date and probably appeared somewhat later. By the end of the Carboniferous, about 299 million years ago, fossils of most of the modern mobile polychaete groups had appeared. Many fossil tubes look like those made by modern sessile polychaetes , but the first tubes clearly produced by polychaetes date from the Jurassic, less than 199 million years ago.", "text_ai_base": "Annelids have soft bodies, making their fossil record sparse.

Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage. Onlookers were saying \"Aren't you Chinese?\" in Mandarin putonghua as they tried to cover the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag. One woman had an orange sign that said, \"Olympic flame for democracy\", while a man carried a poster with a tank and the slogan \"One world, two dreams\". A university student and former RDHK radio host Christina Chan wrapped the Tibetan snow lion flag around her body and later began waving it. Several onlookers heckled Chan, shouting \"What kind of Chinese are you?\" and \"What a shame!\" In the end, she and some of the protesters were taken away against their will by the authorities via a police vehicle \"for their own protection.\" Chan is currently[when?] suing the Hong Kong government, claiming her human rights were breached.
