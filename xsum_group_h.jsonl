It is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that: Originally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May. The standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January. What's it for? The government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous. The tax will also raise a lot of money for the government. So will this help deal with the budget deficit? The Treasury hopes the tax will bring in \u00a32.6bn every year. That's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year. It's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five. What's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage? Traditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies. But during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets. Unlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again. A lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days. When the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts. This caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend. Unable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure. Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy? Bank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock. But since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs."}

The NSA's spying was leaked by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor who has since fled to Russia. The NSA has collected data about numbers called and times, but not the content of conversations. It also allegedly spied on European firms. Among individuals targeted was German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Germany has \"drastically reduced\" internet surveillance for the NSA, reports say, after the US agency failed to provide \"clear justification\" for each search. Members of Congress could \"help reinforce the court's decision\" next week, American University's Gordon Adams tells me. That's when House members are expected to vote on a bill, the USA Freedom Act, that would end the NSA's collection of bulk data. Some senators, however, want things to remain the same. They've pushed for an extension of a provision, Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act that allows the NSA to collect the data. Section 215 expires in June, and an extension would allow the NSA to carry on with its work. US spy leaks: How intelligence is gathered How vulnerable is the internet? US states take aim at NSA facilities The latest verdict, by the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, came after New York District Judge William Pauley had dismissed a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which argued that the way the NSA tracked million of calls contravened the US constitution. The 97-page ruling says that \"a provision of the USA Patriot Act permitting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect business records deemed relevant to a counterterrorism investigation cannot be legitimately interpreted to permit the systematic bulk collection of domestic calling records\". However, the appeals court stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of the programme, launched after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US. The Snowden revelations in June 2013 caused an international outcry, despite US administrations insisting the programme has been fully authorised. The measures - repeatedly approved in secret by a national security court since 2006 - are set to expire on 1 June. Leaders of the lower US House of Representatives would prefer to pass a bill to end the government's bulk collection of phone records and replace it with legislation that supporters say protects civil liberties. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he wants to extend the Patriot Act and retain the bulk collection programme. The White House supports \"an alternative mechanism to preserve the program's essential capabilities without the government holding the bulk data\", said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council."}

But Newcastle's victory was soured by the loss of top scorer Dwight Gayle, who limped off after 33 minutes. Villa striker Scott Hogan was carried off on a stretcher late on and they are now winless in nine league matches. Hogan, who cost \u00a312m from Brentford in January, landed awkwardly after challenging for a header at a late Villa corner. Gayle - the Championship's leading scorer with 20 league goals this season - appeared to suffer a recurrence of the hamstring problem which had kept him out for six matches. Villa remain six points above the relegation zone, having collected only one point in 2017, although Steve Bruce's side had more than matched the Magpies until they fell behind. Iceland midfielder Birkir Bjarnason went closest for the visitors, failing to hook in Hogan's flick-on from close range and later having a shot saved by Karl Darlow. Newcastle's opening goal came soon after Gayle's departure, with Villa failing to properly clear a Matt Ritchie cross and French winger Gouffran tapping in. After that, the hosts took control and often looked likely to extend their lead, although the second goal which took them above Brighton in the table came in fortunate circumstances. Jamaal Lascelles met Jonjo Shelvey's corner and his effort hit Lansbury, who was stationed at the near post, before ricocheting into the net. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez told BBC Radio Newcastle: \"This is a very difficult division. Every game is tough and we were playing against a good team with very good players. \"They pressed well at the beginning and it wasn't easy for us to play how we wanted. We needed to score to open up the game, and after the second goal it was more open. We had more chances and more control of the game. \"Dwight Gayle seemed like he wasn't comfortable from the beginning and then he said he was feeling something in his hamstring. We don't know how serious it is. We have to wait.\" Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce told BBC WM: \"Scott's injury compounded the night, because we obviously fear the worst. \"He's definitely turned his ankle over and we don't know how serious it is until we see X-rays and scans. The consequences of losing him are huge, but let's hope it's not as bad as what we think. \"I thought we were decent in the first half, Newcastle hadn't been near our goal, and yet we gave a poor goal away. After the restart, we've given another one away and the second one was comical."}
{"id": "xsum_35162395", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "But in tourism-dependent Antigua, a deadly disease has wiped out almost half of the island's majestic coconut palms - leaving unsightly headless trunks littering the landscape. Lethal yellowing, the same condition that devastated the iconic trees in Florida and Jamaica, also strikes at the heart of this 280sq km (108sq mile) island's culture and economy. Here, coconut products are used in everything from food and drink to beauty treatments and traditional medicine. Around 45% of Antigua's thousands of coconut palms have been lost to date, estimates Barbara Japal, president of the island's Horticultural Society. Street vendor Julian Rose is one of those affected. He has been selling coconut water for $3.70 (\u00c2\u00a32.40) a bottle for four years, but says the last 12 months have seen supplies nosedive by half - as has his income. \"I've kept my prices the same - people won't pay more,\" he says. The official advice states that palms showing signs of the contagious disease, characterised by premature shedding of fruit and yellowing fronds that eventually drop off, should immediately be cut down and burned to prevent the disease spreading. But the cash-strapped government's lack of resources has enabled it to run rampant, with the trees dying in droves since lethal yellowing was first identified in 2012. \"It affects tourism because, as we say, the 'palm is the charm' and it really diminishes what the seascape looks like,\" Mrs Japal tells the BBC. \"It's devastating to see them standing there looking like beheaded soldiers. It's shocking, it feels irreverent. \"Coconuts are used in so many aspects of daily life here too; people cook with them, put the oil on their skin and hair. And while it may not be part of conventional medicine, it's part of our tradition to use the oil to heal the skin and cleanse the body.\" Lethal yellowing is spread by a plant-hopping insect that Mrs Japal believes was probably brought into the country with imported trees. A ban on importing palms has been in place since 2012. \"We had so many plants brought in some years ago,\" Mrs Japal continues. \"We have a plant protection unit but when you have a container with 3,000 trees, who's going to inspect every one?\" She says underfunding had left staff's hands tied. \"There's no proper disposal or systematic removal of affected palms unless private individuals take action.\" There is currently no cure for lethal yellowing, although trees can be treated with quarterly injections of the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC). \"Local people are not using OTC; it's just too expensive,\" Mrs Japal adds."}
{"id": "xsum_37512637", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "Well perhaps it is. It certainly took the commodities markets (and me) rather by surprise when it agreed to cut production at a meeting in Algiers. In fact the group has a lot of work to do before it has a real and sustained impact on the price. But that decision was not what the market expected. Traders thought the result would be more disarray, as there was at a meeting of Opec and some other oil exporters in Doha back in April. This time they did manage to make progress. The context for the Algiers decision - and the unsuccessful attempts to agree action before - is crude oil prices are less than half what they were in June 2014. That hurts Opec member countries. Government finances and economic performance have taken a substantial hit. In Saudi Arabia for example, the government's finances were in surplus to the tune of 12% of annual income (GDP) in 2012. Last year there was a deficit of 16%. Angola's economy grew 7% in 2013. Last year it was 3%. Venezuela's figures are much worse, though it's far from being entirely due to the lower price of oil. That has however severely aggravated the economic damage done by the country's political crisis. Opec member countries have felt this financial pain with increasing intensity for almost two years now. Opec doesn't account for the whole market by a long way. There are very large oil producers that are not members, notably the United States, Russia, China and Canada. But the group, which currently has about 40% of the global market can move it by cutting production - and it does have a history of responding to low oil prices, by cutting production. In the past Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest player, has often led the effort. This time the situation was complicated by Iran's emergence earlier this year from international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Tehran was determined to take advantage and sought to recover its share of the market. For Opec, the trouble was that Saudi Arabia was unwilling to curb production without Iran doing likewise, a position also underpinned by the longstanding geopolitical tension between the two countries which are the leading powers in the Gulf. That tension was the reason for the failure in Doha in April. Things seem to have changed. Iran has boosted oil production already. It could go higher, but not as easily as was the case in the immediate aftermath of the lifting of sanctions. Saudi Arabia has softened its position."}

Next month the EU is expected to deliver its decision on Apple. The company could be hit with a multi-billion pound bill for unpaid taxes. The commission said there was \"no bias against US companies\" in the probes. In a report published on Wednesday, the US regulator said action by Brussels would make it into a \"supra-national tax authority\" overriding the tax codes of its member states. It also said Brussels was using a different set of criteria to judge cases involving US companies, adding that potential penalties were \"deeply troubling\". Apple has been accused of sheltering billions of pounds in profit in the Republic of Ireland tax-free, under a deal it reached with Irish authorities. JP Morgan, an investment banker for Apple, has said the company could face a bill for $19bn (\u00c2\u00a314.3bn) in a worst-case scenario. Several companies including Apple, Amazon and Starbucks are under investigation by the European Commission over allegations of tax avoidance. Last year, the commission ruled that Starbucks and Fiat were given sweetheart tax deals in the Netherlands. The EU's executive body said it was investigating whether Apple was given special tax benefits for setting up in Ireland that were not granted to other companies, potentially violating EU state aid rules. Earlier this year the US government publicly challenged the investigation by Brussels, accusing it of targeting US corporations. In its latest move, the Treasury Department asked Brussels to reconsider its actions against several US companies including Apple, Starbucks, and Amazon. It argued penalties for these firms could have broader repercussions for cross-border taxation. \"The investigations have global implications as well for the international tax system and the G20's agenda to combat [tax avoidance] while improving tax certainty to fuel growth and investment,\" Robert Stack, a Treasury Department deputy wrote in a blog on the agency's website. He argued that a charge from the European Commission could be considered a foreign tax credit in the US - a classification that could reduce the businesses' tax bills in the US. The Treasury Department said it was continuing to \"consider potential responses should the commission continue its present course\". In response the commission said it was trying to ensure EU law was applied equally to all companies operating in Europe. Apple has previously said that it had not had \"any special tax deal with the Irish government\". \"We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials,\" the company has said."}

The coalition government reduced the highest income tax rate from 50% to 45% in 2013. Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, criticised Mr Osborne's refusal to rule out a further cut. Asked on Sky News's Murnaghan programme if there were plans to cut income tax by 5% for those earning over \u00a3150,000, George Osborne said \"that's not our plan\". Challenged as to whether he would explicitly rule the move out, the chancellor replied: \"You can judge us by what we say we want to do. And what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to \u00a312,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions of people are better off. \"And when it comes to higher-rate tax payers, our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate to \u00a350,000. \"Those are our big tax commitments for the coming Parliament.\" When asked later if he would cut the top rate of tax, Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"It's not our policy. It's not our plan. \"Our plan is to raise to \u00a312,500 the basic rate threshold, so that we take another million people out of income tax altogether and cut tax for 30 million people. That's the plan.\" But Ed Balls said: \"When George Osborne cut the top rate of income tax from 50p down to 45p we know that he and David Cameron wanted to go further and actually cut it to 40p - which, if they were to do that, would mean hundreds of thousands more in tax cuts for the richest people in our society.\" He added: \"They need to tell us is that their plan - they won't rule it out, they should do so now.\" This election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat minister David Laws has accused the Conservatives of \"unbelievable cheek\" in taking credit for personal tax allowance rises. Mr Laws, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, said the prime minister and chancellor had failed to push for the move in talks with Lib Dems. His party will spell out plans to \"go further and faster\" in increasing the allowance in the coming days, he said. George Osborne said raising the level was one of his \"big tax commitments\". The tax-free personal allowance is to rise from \u00a310,600 in 2015-6 to \u00a310,800 in 2016-7 and \u00a311,000 in 2017-8.

The contract, which will also involve maintaining the fleet, will be awarded in 2019. The trains are for the first phase of the project, due to open in 2026 and run between London and Birmingham. Construction will begin later this year and it is expected to reduce rail times between Birmingham and London by 32 minutes. A second Y-shaped phase of HS2 will open in two stages. The line from Birmingham to Crewe will launch in 2027, with the remaining construction - which includes a spur taking HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport - due to finish six years later. There will be separate contracts in the future to supply trains for this phase. Transport secretary Chris Grayling said the new railway would carry more than 300,000 people a day. \"Hundreds of jobs will be created in building and maintaining these trains, representing a great opportunity for British-based businesses and suppliers. \"In total 25,000 jobs and 2,000 apprenticeships will be created during HS2 construction and we have held discussions with UK suppliers to make sure they are in the best possible position to win contracts,\" he added. Friday's launch comes ahead of a formal start of the process in spring 2017, when companies interested in bidding can learn more about the process. Formal invitations to tender will be made in 2018. Hitachi Rail Europe said it will bid for the contract to build the HS2 trains. The rail manufacturer is headquartered in London and builds trains at its plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. Its sales director, Nick Hughes, said: \"Our HS2 trains would be built in Britain, for Britain, and combine world-leading Japanese Shinkansen technology with British manufacturing know-how.\" Gordon Wakeford, managing director of Siemens Mobility, said a manufacturing contract of this scale was \"exciting news\" for the rail industry and would have a \"positive impact on the wider UK supply chain\". The company had recently \"ramped up\" its HS2 activity with the appointment of two executives to lead the HS2 rolling stock bid team, he added. HS2 has been dogged by controversy, with critics saying the scheme poses a threat to swathes of English countryside."}

The Hebe crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June. \"It was torrid, dangerous and nerve-wracking with all-day long German air attacks\", says Harold Biles who marked his 28th birthday during the height of the bombardment. \"The Hebe was lying about 200 metres off the beach at Dunkirk, and there was just a seething mass of soldiers.

We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep.\" In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England. \"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves.

Fifty NFL players were arrested in 2014 for a wide degree of offences - from Tennessee's Shonn Greene, who parked in a disabled parking bay, to Minnesota's Adrian Peterson, who was arrested over child abuse. There were five cases of domestic violence, including that of Baltimore's Ray Rice, who was filmed by hotel security punching his then fiancee - now wife - in a lift. Goodell himself became personally embroiled in the Rice case in an argument over what the NFL did or did not know. There was also a far-reaching report chaired by the former director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, which highlighted the fundamental mismanagement of the situation by league officials. And the bad news kept on coming for the embattled commissioner. Just 30 days into 2015, there have been four fresh player arrests, including two for domestic violence and one for rape. Elsewhere, it is a sorry tale: Yet despite all this mayhem and chaos the NFL, as a product, is flourishing. The moral outrage surrounding the cases of Rice and Peterson calmed down fairly quickly and audiences flocked yet again to stadiums around the country.

The deeply revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on 13 October, plunging Thailand into mourning. The prince was widely expected to succeed his father, but officials had earlier said he wanted to postpone it by at least a year. The official reason given was that he wanted to give the Thai people time to mourn his father before he became king. Correspondents say Thailand was left in an odd constitutional limbo as the prince, the undisputed heir, should have succeeded his father immediately. In the past doubts have been expressed by senior officials over how the crown prince can perform the role played by his father for 70 years. The monarchy occupies a pivotal place in Thailand's political order. King Bhumibol Adulyadej had been seen as a unifying figure amid periods of political unrest, including during the most recent military coup in 2014. The leader of Thailand's parliament, the National Legislative Assembly, is expected to meet the crown prince in the next few days to formally invite him. Once the crown prince accepts, his succession would then be announced to the public. But it is still not clear when that will happen. Former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda is currently standing in as regent. Thailand has rarely had what might be called routine royal successions. The last was 70 years ago, when the young King Ananda was found shot dead in his bedroom in still unexplained circumstances. When he died, an emergency session of parliament that night named his grief-stricken brother Bhumibol king. Despite private speculation over the prospects of his popular sister Princess Sirindhorn, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has been the undisputed heir to the throne since his formal investiture in 1972. Thai succession law follows the principle of primogeniture, where the throne should pass to the eldest son of the reigning king, but it also gives the king the discretion to name his own choice. King Bhumibol never wavered in his endorsement of the crown prince. But the crown prince's unexpected decision to delay taking the throne has made this yet another succession which has departed from the script. His real reasons are not known; public mourning for his father would not have been affected had he been anointed immediately after his father's death."}

IHAT's closure was announced after a lawyer in charge of many of the abuse cases was struck off for misconduct. Veterans minister Mark Lancaster said IHAT was set up for the right reasons but was \"completely abused\" by lawyers. Sgt Wood, who served in the 1st Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment told BBC Breakfast the Ministry of Defence said the government had \"big lessons to learn\". Talking about the Al-Sweady Inquiry into allegations against service personnel in Iraq, he said: \"The allegations were of the highest order - unlawful killing, mutilation and mistreatment of prisoners of war,\" he said. \"That just did not happen and I just don't know where they got the fuel from. He said the closure of IHAT was \"good news\". \"We had holes in our system which were exploited.\" Sgt Wood said it would have been better for the team to consider allegations in detail first before releasing them as part of a public inquiry. He said: \"I can speak for me and my soldiers and what they've put us through for that period of time, it was damaging to a degree of careers, marriage split ups and also fuelling the fire of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and the trauma that we had seen on the battlefield\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just to get these allegations thrown at you is a bitter pill to swallow.\" Former Army Captain Rachel Webster, who was arrested and questioned after a dawn raid in January 2014, said the closure of IHAT was \"too little too late\". She told ITV News: \"I hadn't done anything. I was humiliated and I will never, ever, forget it and neither will any other soldier or veteran that has had this done to [them] as well. \"It has ruined lives. It has destroyed me, literally destroyed me.\" Mr Lancaster told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had a duty to investigate allegations of abuse, saying: \"We can't simply sweep things under the carpet.\" Without IHAT, he said, UK troops could have been subjected to inquiries by the International Criminal Court, but he said the decision to close it now was \"positive\". IHAT was set up in 2010 to examine allegations against UK servicemen and women made by Iraqi civilians. But on Friday, the Ministry of Defence said the unit, described by the Commons defence committee as an \"unstoppable self-perpetuating machine, deaf to the concerns of the armed forces\", would be shut down in the summer and its remaining cases handed to the Royal Naval Police."}

It is a bitter sweet achievement. He has designed his dream house from memory of a time before, for there are no windows to open here. We are in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, and the schoolroom in this camp, like all the 40 or so other buildings, is made of wooden frames on concrete floors, covered in plastic sheeting. Much of it is decorated with incongruous advertising pictures, black-and-white shots of men in sunglasses and designer stubble. UK Prime Minister David Cameron wants to take refugees directly from camps like this in the Middle East, rather than absorb the people who have already made the journey to Hungary, Greece or Italy. The logic is that it will stop people making the perilous voyage across the Mediterranean. It makes a lot of sense. But it may already be too little, and far too late. Taking 4,000 more people each year until 2020 will hardly dent the problem. The border with Syria is only a few miles across the hill rising above the camp. The people here can still hear the war they fled, as President Bashar al-Assad's bombs land on a besieged town. Life is definitely safer this side of the border. But it is not comfortable. There are rats, the drinking water is dirty, and while it is now stifling under the September Sun, in winter the snow is 3ft (1m) high and they freeze. More importantly, life is getting worse and the pressure to leave Lebanon is growing all the time. One man, Mzead al-Ali, tells me he is on the brink of following those who have made the perilous exodus, leaving his wife and four children, including two seven-month-old twins, behind in the camp, so he can send them money. His brother left three days ago for Turkey. They haven't heard from him since he went, and don't know if he is safe. His mother wants to talk about it but has to keep pressing her hands flat against her face, to stop the tears. This is not, according to the government here, a refugee camp but a temporary settlement, and there are thousands like it. Lebanon is a country of four million people, and it now hosts well over a million refugees from its war-riven bigger neighbour. A third live in camps like this, but life is difficult also for others who have more conventional accommodation. The burden on Lebanon is nearly unbearable, as a government minister told me, and there are rising tensions."}

The Cabinet Office report found relations behind the scenes were \"broken\", and it would be at least another year before another planning application could be submitted. However, the authors said that a new stadium was still \"achievable\". They said the overall business case \"remains sound\". The report was commissioned after Mr Scott told a Stormont committee in April that the emergency-exiting arrangements in the proposed 38,000-capacity stadium were flawed. However, the report has recommended that he be replaced as chair of the Safety Technical Group overseeing the Casement project. The report has called for other personnel changes: Sports Minister Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn has indicated she will implement all of the recommended changes. She said a key finding that the stadium is still achievable was welcome and provided clarity. The report stated: \"Relationships between the key stakeholders are broken. \"We believe the use of an independent mediator will be needed to reset working relationships.\" Work on the stadium was supposed to start this year but planning permission was overturned in December 2014. The report stated: \"The Casement Park project is behind schedule and has to address two key issues before it can make progress. \"It needs to find a way to resolve issues raised with the proposed emergency-exiting arrangements for the stadium. \"It also needs to reapply for and achieve planning permission.\" The report also included a \"delivery confidence assessment\" that is based on traffic lights, with green being the highest rating. Casement is rated \"amber/red\". Although the report recommends that Mr Scott be replaced as chair of the safety technical group, that does not mean he cannot continue to sit on the group. The report says his replacement will need mediation and facilitation skills \"rather than technical knowledge\". The chairman of the Stormont committee which is investigating Mr Scott's allegations said the Cabinet Office report \"is part of the resolution but only part\". Democratic Unionist Party MLA Nelson McCausland said the minister and her officials had more questions to answer. \"This coming week we'll be convening a special meeting of the committee at Stormont and we will be requesting that the minister and the permanent secretary appear before the committee to answer the questions that we will be putting to them,\" he said."}

In 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality. An 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status\". Thousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities. As the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division. Weekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair. The church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches. Looking around the camp, one of several along Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, you might think that the parishioners have little to be thankful for. It is surely one of the poorest places in Latin America. A year ago thousands of returning Haitians arrived at Parc Cadeau. Some had been forcibly deported from the Dominican Republic, others left voluntarily to avoid confrontation with the authorities. Today hundreds of families remain on the dusty ranch, living in hastily erected shacks of plastic sheeting, cardboard and rope, trapped in near stateless limbo. Soinicier Giles is typical of many in the camp. He spent 22 years living as a farmer in the Dominican Republic, before being deported last year. He takes me to a ramshackle hut to meet his wife Eleny and six of their eight children. The other two were left behind when he was deported. The conditions are extremely harsh, especially for the youngest. \"We sleep directly on the floor and it gets wet inside when it rains,\" Eleny explains. The children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself. They are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp. \"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish. One of the few local figures helping the returnees is the parish priest, Father Luc Leandre. With funds from the International Organisation for Migration, he has helped relocate some of the most desperate families to nearby communities in Haiti. \"It's a grave crisis, very, very bad,\" Father Leandre tells me. \"The Church is like a mother for everyone and I have a duty to help."}

The first one to raise the alert was President Mauricio Funes himself, last April. \"We have information that they [the cartels] have entered El Salvador with exploratory purposes,\" President Funes said. Because of what he described as the \"effectiveness\" of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's policies, the cartels were looking at new bases for their operations, he added. Since then, security forces have been watching closely to see if criminal organisations like the Zetas - one of Mexico's most violent cartels - are deploying in Salvadorean territory. The cartels' possible collusion - or confrontation - with local gangs is also being monitored. Douglas Garcia Funes from the Salvadorean national police says intelligence suggests that gang members are already \"being used by or are operatives for the transport of drugs and money towards the United States, passing through Mexico\". In a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, this is a sobering scenario. It could bring more chaos to an already violent country, many Salvadoreans say - and the government seems to be bracing for the worst. \"We are certainly worried, and that is why we want to act in a preventive manner,\" Hugo Martinez, El Salvador's foreign minister, told BBC News. In pictures: Life inside an El Salvador jail The presence of the gangs known as \"maras\", born among Salvadorean migrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s, is believed to be the largest contributor to those soaring rates. Some estimates say that about 15,000 young men and women belong to one of the gangs. In some families, a third generation of gang members is now developing. The maras have strong territorial control in some areas of the country and practice what they call \"social cleansing\" - they wipe out petty crime, but ask for money from locals in exchange for protection, and engage in widespread criminal activity. A retired gang member, who prefers not to be named, says that belonging to a \"mara\" gives young, poor Salvadoreans a sense of vindication against the larger society. \"People are scared, are afraid of what a gang member can do, like stealing or killing,\" he says. \"That is what being part of a 'mara' is about.\" The maras are not new to El Salvador, but an incident in June marked a turning point. Gang members set fire to a small bus in the capital, killing 17 people. The government branded it a \"terrorist act\"."}

Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (\u00a342,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to \"face this issue head-on\". The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: \"They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable.\" Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem. He told CNN: \"I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit.\" There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players. A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng. The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby.

He also described it as \"an enemy of progress\". \"It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,\" he added. \"The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. \"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on.

Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit.\" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: \"The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. \"What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions\"."}

There are four investigations examining \"Trojan Horse\" claims that groups of hardline Muslims have been trying to take over schools in the city. A government source says that no options have been ruled in or out. The trust which runs Park View, one of the schools caught up in the claims, issued a statement on Thursday dismissing allegations of extremism as false. The education watchdog Ofsted and the Department for Education are expected to deliver reports in June on the next steps for schools which have faced these allegations. It is understood that ministers have approached heads of successful schools and academy trusts about taking over other schools where there have been concerns. This could include taking schools away from local authority control, converting them into academies - directly funded by central government - and putting them under the leadership of high-achieving head teachers. Groups of outstanding schools like the Perry Beeches chain in Birmingham may have a role. As some of the schools caught up in the Trojan Horse claims are already academies, it could mean schools being reassigned to other academy trusts. Birmingham City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on any \"proposed action\" until Ofsted's inspection reports had been published. \"We can say, however, that we are in regular contact with DfE and this action has not been discussed with us,\" said a council spokesperson. The GMB union warned: \"It is absolutely disgusting that the government is pre-empting the outcome of the investigation into these schools and planning to sell these schools on to their friends in the academy chains.\" Before the Trojan Horse claims, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had spoken publicly of his belief that the local authority might need to be broken up. Birmingham is the biggest local authority in England - and it is believed that private soundings have shown it would be difficult to find a private sector contractor willing or able to take on the running of such a wide range of services. But another option would be for some or all of the council's education and children's services to be hived off to an independent trust. This model has been used before where central government believed there was a need for radical intervention - such as in Hackney in London. Birmingham City Council's chief executive, Mark Rogers, was recorded at a meeting with school representatives last week, where he warned of a \"firestorm\" when the Ofsted reports were published, and telling his audience to prepare for \"significant structural changes\" within the education department."}

The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January. The Home Office has refused to comment on the case. TPims replaced control orders in January 2012. The suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March. The BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim. The Home Office said: \"We do not comment on individual cases. The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable.\" Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day. Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad. Labour has argued that TPims have \"weakened\" public protection against terrorism. In March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only. The court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order. The allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station. BM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons. The prosecutor Louise Gray asked for a provisional date of 2 July to be set for a plea and case management hearing. The defendant was granted unconditional bail although he remains subject to the restrictions imposed by his TPim. A trial date was not set."}

Two researchers demonstrated the weaknesses by changing a flight booking and seat assignment for a reporter. The security investigators presented their findings at the Chaos Communications Congress in Germany. In a blog detailing their work Karsten Nohl and Nemanja Nikodijevic of Security Research Labs (SRL) said the computer systems behind the airlines' travel bookings system dated from the 1970s and 1980s. Though these have been updated with web services they lack security systems that would prevent abuse, they said. In particular, they added, the systems have no way to check, or authenticate, who is querying the system for flight details. Few of the reservation checking systems limit how many attempts can be made to query details. These flaws can be exploited, said the pair, because the codes used to identify travellers and their itineraries use a restricted character set. This makes it possible to bombard servers with queries to find out a person's details. \"Given only passengers' last names, their bookings codes can be found over the internet with little effort,\" they wrote. This access would let attackers steal personal information, divert frequent flyer benefits or use the data to lend credibility to phishing attacks. In some cases, said Mr Nohl, getting at a booking would let an attacker completely change flight details potentially letting them travel for free. SRL showed how the flaws could be exploited by working with German TV station ARD to change the flight of a reporter and putting him in a seat next to a German politician. Airlines and travel agents should move quickly to protect traveller data, urged the two researchers. The first step should be to limit the number of queries that can be made for a particular booking, they said. The vast majority of flight bookings are handled by three firms: Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport. Booking firm Amadeus said it was \"assessing\" the researchers' findings. It added that it planned to \"address\" the problems that had been exposed and would work with its partners to close the loopholes. It added that it had already limited the number of queries that could be made about a booking. Sabre said it had \"numerous layers\" of security surrounding flight itinerary systems. \"Discussing how we maintain security and the privacy of travellers undermines those safeguards and the security of our systems,\" it told the Reuters news agency. Travelport has not yet responded to the release of the information by SRL."}

This is the university application season for UK students - and open day visits now include trips to Dutch universities, which are pitching themselves as if they were offshore Russell Group institutions. Since tuition fees rose to \u00a39,000 in England there have been repeated forecasts that students would head for cheaper European universities. Now it seems to be actually happening. Across the Netherlands, there are 2,600 UK students in universities this term - up by a third in a year. And independent school head teachers want Dutch universities to be included in the Ucas application form. The University of Groningen is a microcosm of this - up by 33% to around 300 UK students, for whom it has had to put on special open days. This 400 year-old university, second oldest in the Netherlands and in the top 100 of international rankings, now designates itself as an English-speaking institution. It is running more degree courses taught in English than in Dutch, with students from Germany, China, the UK and the Netherlands itself, all learning in English. For families from England attending the open day in Groningen, the question of tuition fees is never far from the surface. Phoebe Watkinson and her father Phil had travelled from Wirral. Phoebe said that as well as being less expensive, going to a European university would give her an \"edge\" in the jobs market. \"It shows a certain quality, it shows bravery to go to another country and it's not that far from home,\" she said. The distance does not seem daunting, she says, as it is as quick to get home from the Netherlands as from some other parts of the UK. Her father says he is from a generation when higher education was free - and he finds it \"difficult to fathom\" the level of debt being piled up. \"I would be extremely pleased if she came here,\" said Mr Watkinson. He says it would benefit her academically and socially as well as financially. \"If you ask most people what their primary driver was for looking at foreign universities, probably most of them would say straight off 'lower fees',\" he says. \"But I think there's a lot more to it than that."}

Recalling the HMS Coventry search, he said: \"We were very conscious that we were diving on a war grave and the casualties that went down with the ship. \"We actually visited their grave and that stays with you.\" Carrying out Operation Blackleg was a physically demanding and dangerous mission for those involved, with some dives lasting for up to eight hours. \"We were 8,000 miles from any kind of rescue facility,\" Mr Gale added. \"There was still hostilities with Argentina and to cap it all there was a 500lb (227kg) unexploded bomb in the wreck somewhere. \"The whole mission was fraught with near misses. \"Cutting into a steel structure underwater traps oxygen and if you hit it with a spark it explodes quite violently. \"One chap lost the front plate out of his helmet and nearly drowned. \"I was knocked unconscious and had to be pulled back into the bell by a colleague of mine.\" Mr Gale admits the mission, 300ft (91m) under the ocean's surface, was to \"recover or destroy certain items\".

The military fuelled confusion in the immediate aftermath by incorrectly saying most of the girls had been rescued. Parents and some girls who escaped say more than 200 students were seized from their school in Chibok in north-eastern Borno state by gunmen overnight. A local government official confirms the incident, saying the exact number of missing students is unclear but puts the number at around 100. Nigeria's military says most of the girls managed to escape or were freed and releases a statement saying only eight girls are still missing. Locals say many remain unaccounted for and parents of the missing girls head into the Sambisa forest near the Cameroonian border to search for them. On their return they say they did not see any Nigerian soldiers in the forest. Major General Chris Olukolade, a military spokesman, says a report stating that most of the girls had been freed was incorrect but was \"not intended to deceive the public.\" Parents insist that more than 200 girls are still missing. The military has not rescued any of the girls. Asabe Kwambura, headmistress of the school in Chibok, appeals to the government to do more to save the girls and calls on the kidnappers - thought to be members of the Boko Haram group - to \"have mercy on the students.\" Ms Kwambura tells the BBC that at least 190 girls are still missing, contradicting a local state governor who said that around 80 of the students were yet to be found. Footage emerges of the school shortly after the attack, showing the classrooms after they were set alight by gunmen. A government source tries to explain the discrepancy, by telling the BBC it was initially thought only science students had been seized ahead of their exam but there were also 105 art students in the hostels at the time, which the authorities had not realised. Nigerians take to social media to show their anger at the government response and Ibrahim M Abdullahi, a lawyer in Abuja, sends the first tweet using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. Hundreds march through Abuja to protest at government \"indifference\" to the mass abduction. A community leader from Chibok warns that the girls may have been taken to neighbouring states and forced to marry militants. He says that 230 girls are missing - another increase in the figure. Desperate parents in Chibok stage a protest calling on the government to do more in the search for the missing girls. Protests are also staged again in towns and cities across Nigeria."}

She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996. This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters. \"Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,\" he says. We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests. As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation. But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world. According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results. He tells me: \"One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?\" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some \"age-memory\" might be transferred into the next generation. \"That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,\" says Prof Sinclair. \"A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.\" The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down."}

It is a collaboration with the National Galleries in London and Dublin. Edinburgh is the last stop for the works inspired by the man known as the \"bad boy\" of early 17th Century art. This is the first exhibition of works by Caravaggio and his followers ever to be shown in Scotland. Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was just 39 when he died in 1610. Four years earlier he had murdered a man after a quarrel over a game of tennis and spent the rest of his life as a fugitive. Christopher Baker, the acting director of the Scottish National Gallery, told BBC Scotland that Caravaggio was a \"revolutionary artist\". He said: \"You could see him as the archetypal bad boy artist who in his private life has a tempestuous time, who behaves appallingly, who is often in the courts and who is on the run having committed murder. \"In addition to all of that he is a great creative force. \"He produces these extraordinary pictures, which unsurprisingly, had an extraordinary impact and inspired other painters, who travelled to Rome and Naples from right across Europe and thought 'I need to do that, I want a piece of that as well'. \"That is the story this exhibition tells.\" One of the paintings in the exhibition, The Taking of Christ (1602), is from the National Gallery of Ireland, where it is on indefinite loan from the Jesuit Community in Dublin. It was rediscovered in 1990 in a Jesuits' residence in the Irish capital. Aidan Weston-Lewis, the curator of exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery, said it was \"frustrating\" to think that it was offered to the Scottish National Gallery for free in 1921 and turned down. He said it was the only painting by Caravaggio that has ever been in a Scottish private collection. It was bought by Scottish country gentleman William Hamilton Nisbet in Rome in 1802, directly from the Mattei family who had commissioned it 200 years earlier. The painting was on display at Biel House in East Lothian for 120 years. Mr Weston-Lewis said: \"His descendants bequeathed a large group of pictures from that collection to the Scottish National Gallery. \"We didn't have space for them all. \"They were paraded in front of the trustees at the next board meeting and some were selected and some weren't. \"Very sadly from our point of view this painting got away."}

It called for more funding to allow GPs to spend at least 15 minutes with each patient. NHS England said consultation lengths were up to doctors and there were no national limits suggesting 10 minutes. However, the NHS Choices website does state that \"GPs spend an average of 8-10 minutes with each patient\" and advises patients to \"plan ahead to make sure you cover everything you want to discuss\". The BMA, which published a report on \"safe working in general practice\" earlier this month, called for a reorganisation and warned that GPs faced \"unsustainable pressure\" from increasing workload and staff shortages. The report said it was intended to \"stimulate discussion\" and put forward a model that could be used across the UK. Dr Nicola Hulme, a GP in Cheshire, said she found NHS England's comment about there being no national limit on appointment times \"insulting\". \"With the high levels of demand, we have to run 10-minute appointments,\" she said. \"To offer longer with the same number of appointments would extend our day to beyond the 12 hours we currently routinely work. \"I often run late so I can deal thoroughly with my patients' issues. \"Paperwork gets started routinely after 7pm. I rarely get home before 8pm, having started generally at 7.30am. \"Nobody goes into medicine for an easy ride, we are all hard workers, but the intensity and the demand are now at unsafe levels.\" Dr Ali Alibhai, who works in central London, said GPs now had to manage so many chronic diseases such as diabetes that a consultation as short as eight minutes was \"not appropriate any more for safe patient care\". Dr Brian Balmer, of the BMA's GPs' committee, said that, in an ageing population, many patients had complex multiple conditions that needed longer to treat. He warned that many GPs were being forced to truncate care and deliver an \"unsafe number of consultations\". He said consultations should be limited to 25 a day, about the same number recommended in many other EU countries. Dr Balmer added: \"We need a new approach that shakes up the way patients get their care from their local GP practice. \"The consultation time needs to increase to 15 minutes with the government providing on its promised funding to make this work.\" Health think tank the King's Fund said its analysis showed GPs were under \"huge pressure due to an increase in workload which has not been matched by a growth in funding or the workforce\"."}

The system utilises one of the University's Digitally Enhanced Learning Spaces (DELS), where students can engage in interactive learning with the aid of 55-inch display screens and state-of-the-art web conference tools. It was developed by Dr John McKeown, a senior clinical lecturer and GP at Cults Medical Group in Aberdeen. He said: \"The biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultations that are almost live, and this adds a sense of immediacy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digitisation has made learning far more interactive. \"We aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the GP's approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate, the direction that they take the consultation, and of course their recommended course of action.\" Dr McKeown said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturers would be able to discuss consultations that have taken place at a variety of practices, where the issues could be very different. He added: \"This means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing GPs who might operate in less affluent areas, or in remote rural locations. \"The system also allows us to work through a number of different consultations in succession, which very much mimics a typical morning for a GP. \"This allows us to see the range of skills - interpersonal, diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day.\" Dr McKeown said that by the time current first year students graduated there would be a pressing need for new GPs in Scotland."}

Getting the same improvement in people would be a shift from being unable to hear traffic to hearing a conversation. However, treating humans is still a distant prospect. If you want to listen to the radio or have a chat with a friend your ear has to convert sound waves in the air into electrical signals which the brain will understand. This happens deep inside the inner ear where vibrations move tiny hairs and this movement creates an electrical signal. However, in about one in 10 people with profound hearing loss, nerve cells which should pick up the signal are damaged. It is like dropping the baton after the first leg of a relay race. The aim of researchers at the University of Sheffield was to replace those baton-dropping nerve cells, called spiral ganglion neurons, with new ones. While there is excitement at the prospect of using stem cells to restore nerves in the ear this exact technique will not help the vast, vast majority of people with hearing loss. Most hearing problems are caused by damage to the tiny delicate hairs which convert mechanical vibrations into electricity. This research group have also converted embryonic stem cells into the early versions of the hair cells. However, injecting them into the ear to restore hearing will be no easy task. The hairs cells all need to be in the exact place and pointing in exactly the right direction. Prof Dave Moore said using stem cells to repair the hairs was \"almost an impossible task\" and that the far-fetched concept of growing and transplanting a replacement ear seemed more likely. They used stem cells from a human embryo, which are capable of becoming any other type of cell in the human body from nerve to skin, muscle to kidney. A chemical soup was added to the stem cells that converted them into cells similar to the spiral ganglion neurons. These were then delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils. Over 10 weeks the gerbils' hearing improved. On average 45% of their hearing range was restored by the end of the study. Dr Marcelo Rivolta said: \"It would mean going from being so deaf that you wouldn't be able to hear a lorry or truck in the street to the point where you would be able to hear a conversation."}

On the ground floor, young men lounge awkwardly in hard-backed chairs, waiting for their turn on the computers lined up on one side of the room. Those in front of the machines don headsets and hold ebullient Skype conversations. Upstairs, the atmosphere is completely different. Bewildered-looking families gather in a stuffy \"safe space\" operated by Save The Children. Parents usher their children over to a pile of toys, while a small boy cries inconsolably. The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room. \"They are Yazidi people from Iraq,\" says Marjan, a translator struggling to find a common language with the new arrivals. There are more than two dozen people in this extended family group. They did not follow the classic route to Serbia via Greece and Macedonia, but came over the country's eastern border with Bulgaria. In the centre's strip-lighted, windowless meeting room, the overflowing ashtrays and half-drunk mugs of Turkish coffee suggest that it has been a stressful morning. The centre's manager, Vladimir Sjekloca, breaks off to explain the situation. \"There are always people in Belgrade,\" he says. \"Around 400-500 a day.\" Vladimir says the increasing restrictions imposed by countries along the Balkan route - and finally its official closure (although hundreds of people have found a way through the border fence to cross from Greece into Macedonia) - have not stopped people seeking a way to western Europe. They have just changed the means. \"Coming in through Bulgaria - it's an old smuggling route and it'll be used more often. The Afghans tell us, 'It's cheaper to come that way [than the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece] and anyway we can't swim.'\" Before its closure, countries along the route had been co-ordinating transport so that people would be taken from Macedonia to Slovenia's border with Austria on officially provided trains and buses. It was a reasonably smooth process which greatly reduced the possibility of refugees falling into the hands of people smugglers. But now people who are desperate or determined to reach western Europe are once again dealing with unscrupulous elements. \"The journey through Bulgaria is full of ill-treatment,\" says Vladimir. \"People suffer at the hands of the mafia and people smugglers - and they don't get protection from the system."}

Billed as a national security speech, her address lacked any new proposals. Instead it was a forceful, often mocking, rebuke of the presumptive Republican nominee, as she framed her pitch in patriotic terms that could also resonate with Republicans. Mrs. Clinton presented herself as the real defender of American values and a commander-in-chief with a steady hand who believed in America as an exceptional country. Mr Trump on the other hand, \"believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a third-world country,\" said Mrs Clinton, speaking in San Diego, a city with 95,000 military personnel. Mrs Clinton was introduced by the spouse of an active duty naval officer and spoke with 20 US flags prominently displayed behind her. Although still fighting a primary, Mrs. Clinton is clearly making a play for independent and Republican voters who are concerned about Mr Trump's erratic foreign policy pronouncements but also his statements on women, Mexican immigrants and Muslims. On Thursday, the head of Hispanic media relations for the Republican National Committee, Ruth Guerra, resigned. Mrs Clinton has always had the potential to appeal to moderate Republicans turned off by their party's stance on social issues such as gay marriage, abortion and even guns, but who feel she is tough enough on foreign policy. In late April, during her speech after her victory in the Pennsylvania primary, Mrs Clinton appealed to \"thoughtful\" Republicans, independents and Democrats to stand together against divisive candidates on the Republican side. Although House speaker Paul Ryan finally endorsed Donald Trump on Thursday after weeks of hesitation, prominent Republicans are not rushing actively to back the presumptive Republican nominee just yet. At least nine Republican governors, and a number of senators, are steering clear from their party convention in July. There has also been a trickle of lifelong, prominent Republicans who openly say they will vote for a Democrat for the first time in their life in November. Mrs Clinton's message on American global leadership may not resonate widely with the GOP (Grand Old Party; Republican) base which is turning more isolationist - but it is finding an audience with many moderates and foreign policy thinkers. On Twitter, the hashtag #RepublicansforHillary was trending for a day this week, after an interview on US cable TV with a former Reagan administration official, Doug Elmets, who said that \"four years of Hillary Clinton is better than one day with Donald Trump as president\"."}

The Home Office said it was \"encouraged\" that so many retailers had been \"denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade\". However, the charity DrugWise said the ban had driven the market underground. Legal highs became popular on the drug scene around 2008. They contain substances which mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy and go by names such as Spice and Black Mamba. What are legal highs? 'Legal highs made me punch my own face' Laws criminalising the production, distribution, sale and supply of the drugs - known as the Psychoactive Substances Act - came into effect at the end of May. Commander Simon Bray, from the National Police Chiefs Council, said London's Metropolitan Police had also seized nearly 14,000 nitrous oxide or laughing gas canisters since the change. Mr Bray said although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact on use of the drugs, \"intuitively I think it must have had an effect\". \"It will certainly make it less easy for the casual first-time user to get involved in this sort of stuff,\" he said adding that he believed many people were \"lulled into buying these things\" thinking they were legal and therefore safe. The Angelus Foundation, which educates people on the risks of legal highs, said it believed many online traders had also shut down. Jeremy Sare, director of communications at the charity, told the BBC: \"I think the ban has made a big difference and we are supportive of the legislation. \"What we are surprised about is the online supply hasn't surged. Traders seem to have stopped selling. It is still early days and we may look back in 12 months and see more online trading but many look to have closed. \"Many were operating within the law but now the law has gone against them so they haven't continued.\" He said the two biggest groups still using the drugs were homeless people and prisoners. Greg, originally from Essex and now living in west Wales, told BBC Radio 5 live about his experience of a legal high known as Holy Smoke. \"I had just a little bit...

Machrihanish is among five sites across Britain - three of which are in Scotland - hoping to be a spaceport. The UK government has previously said it wanted to establish a spaceport by the end of 2018. It launched a consultation in 2014 and two years ago it drew up a shortlist of potential sites. These also included Prestwick in South Ayrshire, Stornoway in the Western Isles, Newquay airport in Cornwall and Llanbedr airport in the Snowdonia National Park. In May last year, the government included plans for spaceport licensing in its Queen's Speech. It also opened up the competition in favour of an airport-style licensing system, meaning any suitable location could become a spaceport. The Department for Transport said this would help create \"viable business models at a range of locations\". This meant that Prestwick and Campbeltown are both vying to attract investment to prove they are \"best-placed\" to become the UK's first operational spaceport. Ministers said any future spaceport would be used as a base for space travel and tourism, as well as satellite launches. The Machrihanish base, near Campbeltown, has twice been approved for space flight and was a certified emergency landing site in Europe ahead of a launch of the NASA Space Shuttle in 1981. Tom Millar, chairman of DiscoverSpace UK and the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company, said the local community was behind the bid and the potential economic benefits it could bring. He added: \"Our site offers enormous scope with a runway of more than 3,000 metres and large areas of land available for development, allied to a positive and supportive planning framework put in place by Argyll and Bute Council. \"Our safety case is very strong as the site is in a depopulated area and offers the ability to launch directly over the sea.\" Brendan O'Hara, the SNP MP for Argyll and Bute, said basing the spaceport in Kintyre was a \"no-brainer\". He added: \"A spaceport would bring important economic benefits to Argyll and Bute and it is a hugely exciting prospect for Scotland to be at the forefront of space travel in the UK.

The allegations - denied by the FN - have now gone to French investigators. Ms Le Pen is campaigning for the second-round vote in the presidential election on 7 May. Her rival, liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron, is ahead of her in opinion polls. The alleged fraudulent payments - from 2012 onwards - concern her and several other FN MEPs. The FN is highly critical of the EU, rejecting its liberal, free market agenda. Ms Le Pen says she is the victim of a politically motivated vendetta. What makes Marine Le Pen far right? In depth: Le Pen and rise of National Front The European Parliament is currently withholding half of Ms Le Pen's salary and expenses, as it tries to recoup money it says she owes. Currently the FN has 24 MEPs, France's biggest contingent. Ms Le Pen has refused to answer a summons over the affair in France, citing her immunity as an MEP. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says most voters drawn to the FN are already highly suspicious of the EU, and may not see the alleged fraud as a particularly serious matter. On Tuesday Ms Le Pen stepped aside as FN leader, saying she needed to be above partisan considerations in the presidential election. The FN's new temporary leader is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jalkh, and he has immediately been caught in a row over a 2000 interview, in which he is quoted as doubting the Nazis' use of Zyklon B cyanide gas to murder Jews and other victims in the death camps. \"I consider it technically impossible - I repeat, impossible - to use it... in mass murder. Why? Because you have to wait several days before you can decontaminate a place where Zyklon B was used,\" Le Monde quoted him as saying. When Le Monde asked him about the remark he called it \"utter rubbish\" and said he had \"no recollection of that [interview]\". A year ago the FN's founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was fined \u20ac30,000 (\u00a325,278; $32,600) for calling the Nazi gas chambers a \"detail\" of World War Two. He was convicted of contesting crimes against humanity. He got the same conviction in 2012 for calling the Nazi occupation of France \"not particularly inhumane\". Marine, his daughter, drew strong criticism on 9 April when she suggested France was not responsible for a 1942 wartime round-up of 13,000 Jews, who were sent from France to Nazi death camps."}

He is considered to be the most cautious policy-maker when it comes to raising interest rates. Interest rates have been at 0.5% since 2009 and the financial crisis. The first increase is now expected in late 2016. Forecasts were put back after the Bank of England's last inflation report in which the Bank said the outlook for global growth had weakened. In a speech to trade union body the TUC, Mr Haldane also indicated that the next rate move could equally be a cut rather than a rise. \"Now more than ever in the UK, policy needs to be poised to move off either foot depending on which way the data break,\" he said in his speech. Mr Haldane said that because wage growth could be weaker than currently expected, inflation may undershoot the Bank's November predictions, when it estimated that inflation would rise above its 2% target in two years. The Consumer Price Index currently stands at 0.1%. \"Against that backdrop, my view is that the case for raising interest rates is still some way from being made,\" Mr Haldane said. \"Whatever the reason, the economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway. That is an awkward, indeed risky, time to be contemplating take-off. \"Meanwhile, inflationary trends do not at present give me sufficient confidence that inflation will be back at target, even two years hence.\" Mr Haldane also had strong words on the UK's increasingly expensive housing market. \"The UK housing market is broken,\" he told the TUC meeting. \"There is a chronic and accumulated imbalance between demand and supply, and it is that which is sending skyward - and has sent skyward - house prices.\""}

And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world, and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism, scientists say. But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory. Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows, at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now. They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy, doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain, who is leading the research, says: \"There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth. \"It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born, because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain, and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong.\" The study - known as the Developing Human Connectome Project - hopes to look at more than 1,500 babies, studying many aspects of their neurological development. By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and at full term, the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth. And they plan to share their map with the wider research community. Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques, which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now. While in the womb, foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs, and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains. But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements, building up full three-dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion."}

Investigators believe Bilel A, aged 26, was either involved in planning the attack or at least knew about it. Police say they have arrested him on suspicion of benefit fraud as they do not have enough evidence against him. Federal prosecutors' spokeswoman Frauke Koehler told reporters on Wednesday that the suspect had known Amri since the end of 2015 and that the pair had met at a restaurant on the evening before the attack and had \"very intense conversations\". The suspect's home in an asylum shelter had been searched and communication devices taken away for analysis, she added. The man is believed to have used at least two false names in several German cities between April and November 2015. A former flatmate of Amri's is also being investigated as a potential witness. Amri twice tried to contact him on 19 December, although it is unclear whether or not they spoke. Over a fortnight after the attack, German prosecutors have said there is now no doubt that 24-year-old Anis Amri was behind the attack. And investigators across Europe have a clearer picture of what happened on the night of the attack and how Amri fled south to Italy. Police in Italy confirmed on Wednesday that the gun used by Amri to murder Polish driver Lukasz Urban was the same he fired four days later in Milan. Shortly before the attack, Amri is thought to have gone to Friedrich-Krause-Ufer, a street where he shot dead Mr Urban. He then went to a mosque and returned to the lorry to carry out the attack on Breitscheidplatz a few miles away. Amri was then seen on camera a short distance from the square at Zoo station, raising an index finger, a gesture linked to jihadist group Islamic State. What happens next is unclear, but it is thought that he escaped to the North Rhine-Westphalia area of western Germany. His final journey took him through the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy, exploiting the open borders of Europe's Schengen zone. Some of Amri's story is yet to emerge. Swiss police said they too had opened an inquiry into the Berlin attack after receiving information from another police force."}

Better mortgage deals have helped absorb some of the \"pent-up demand\", the trade body added. But prices are still likely to continue rising, according to Rics. Separately, figures from mortgage lenders show that the government's recently launched Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme seems to have reduced the size of the average deposit required of first-time buyers. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that in January, the average first-time deposit had fallen to 18%, from 20% in December. However, the number of loans to first-time buyers, and to those moving from a home they already own, fell back because of the normal seasonal lull in the market at this time of year. The number of mortgages granted to home buyers in January was 16% down from December, but was still 30% higher than in January last year, reflecting the upsurge in sales in the past 12 months. This lull in activity may continue according to Simon Rubinsohn, Rics' chief economist. \"The growth in buyer numbers that we've seen for some months started to slow down in February, as the surge in interest sparked towards the end of last summer began to level off,\" he said. \"While this certainly doesn't mean an end to the increasing activity we've been seeing recently, it does suggest that the pent up demand generated throughout the downturn is gradually exhausting itself.\" One other reason for the slowdown could have been last month's bad weather, especially the floods, making people less likely to view properties, Mr Rubinsohn added. But there are still too few properties coming on to the market, Rics said, which means prices are likely to keep going up. The cost of a home in the UK continued to rise during February, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous month, the organisation said. It said 45% more chartered surveyors saw prices rise rather than fall in February. According to its surveys, the cost of a home has now risen across the country for 11 consecutive months. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), released in February, the average price of a UK has now hit \u00c2\u00a3250,000 for the first time. The ONS said house prices rose by 5.5% last year. However, other reports carry much lower estimates. One of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, the Nationwide Building Society, says the average UK home is now worth \u00c2\u00a3177,846 with annual prices rising more than 9%."}

There is no known cure to Morquio syndrome but the drug improves the life of people with the condition. It replaces a missing enzyme which allows children to continue to grow, as well as improving stamina and the ability to walk. It also relieves pain. The drug's manufacturers have been providing the treatment to patients at their own expense but they are going to withdraw it unless the NHS in England and Scotland commit to funding it. The Stranraer Academy student said her life would be markedly different without the drug. \"I wouldn't be able to move I'd just be in so much pain,\" she said. \"And I probably wouldn't be able to go to school.\" It was that situation which prompted her friend to launch the petition which now has nearly 2,000 signatures. \"As a friend I suppose I felt kind of bad that she was going to be denied this because I know she has got a great outlook on life,\" Kyle explained. \"She's funny, she's friendly and I would hate to see her in pain all the time.\" Galloway and West Dumfries MSP Alex Fergusson has also backed the petition. \"This is not a cheap medication but, as Katie herself asked me, how do you put a value on a human life?\" he asked. \"There are only just over a hundred sufferers throughout the UK, with just five in Scotland, and those who have had treatment with Vimizim report a massive reduction in pain and the other symptoms of this syndrome. \"Life expectancy, which rarely exceeds the mid 20s without treatment, can be considerably extended with this treatment, and it is enormously to the credit of Katie and her friends that they have raised this petition to try to ensure that the treatment is available to all.\" The Scottish Medicines Consortium said the drug was currently going through its assessment process.

The deal will now be put to a ballot of the union's membership. Up to 10,000 prison officers in England and Wales protested last month over claims of a \"surge\" in jail violence. They stopped work over claims of a \"surge in violence\" in jails but returned to work after a High Court injunction ordered them to end their 24-hour protest. Under the agreement, prison officers will be allowed to retire at 65 - up to three years ahead of the current state pension age - at no cost to them and with full pension benefits. Uniformed staff will also be given consolidated pay rises of between 0.5% and 1% for each of the next three years, on top of usual performance-related pay increases. They also stand to receive a \"recognition and retention\" package totalling \u00c2\u00a31,000. Prisons minister Sam Gyimah, said the government and POA had also \"agreed a significant number of health and safety reforms as well as new powers for governors in terms of how they deploy their staff in prisons\". The POA directed members to take action last month after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down. It came after multiple high-profile incidents at prisons across England. In October, Jamal Mahmoud, an inmate at HMP Pentonville, died after being stabbed to death in an attack at the prison, which left two others injured. And last month prisoners caused almost \u00c2\u00a31m of damage during a riot at Bedford prison. Days later at HMP Isle of Wight, an inmate cut a prison officer's throat with a razor blade on the way back to his cell. In an effort to tackle safety issues Justice Secretary Liz Truss unveiled proposals detailing \u00c2\u00a31.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for 2,100 extra prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors. In response to the new pay deal she said: \"This agreement is a good offer which rightly recognises the hard work and dedication of officers across the country doing a tough job.\""}

The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe. In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection. Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus. It can take Europe\u2019s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today\u2019s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost. That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes. The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece. The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy. \"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc. \"Here, we\u2019ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News. Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida. The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan. The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year. Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace. The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight. More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth. There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade. OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage."}

Here is Newsround's guide to what has been going on between the UK and the European Union. Back in 2013, British Prime Minister David Cameron promised that if his political party, the Conservatives, won the next general election, then he would let voters have their say on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. Last year, they won the election so it's all systems go. A referendum is a vote in which all adults can take part, normally giving a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of the votes wins. The European Union, or EU, is a group of 28 countries in Europe whose governments work together. It began after World War Two with the idea that the best chance of stopping another war was by countries working more closely together. It's a bit like a club. To join you have to agree to follow the rules and in return you get certain benefits. Each country has to pay money to be a member, which they mostly do through taxes. The EU uses the money to change the way people live and do business in Europe. It has its own parliament, which is made up of politicians called Members of the European Parliament. They are elected by people who live in European Union countries. One of the main jobs of the parliament is to change, approve or reject laws that apply to all EU countries. 1957: Belgium, France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg 1973: Denmark, Ireland and the UK 1981: Greece 1986: Portugal and Spain 1995: Austria, Finland and Sweden 2004: Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Cyprus 2007: Bulgaria and Romania 2013: Croatia One major reason the European Union was set up is trade: to make it easier for countries to buy and sell things to each other. Certain rules to do with immigration have been relaxed too - so people from EU countries can move around more freely inside the Union. EU laws affect many areas of our lives - like how many hours we're allowed to work in a week, health and safety rules, and even how many fish we're allowed to catch. For the 40 years that the UK's been a member of the EU, there's been a debate about our role within it. Some feel being part of this bigger club makes the UK richer and more important. Others argue that the EU takes power away from Britain."}

Friday's competition was the first major event in Manchester since the attack and drew thousands to a sunny Deansgate and Albert Square. The latter, which three days ago hosted a vigil for those who lost their lives in the attack, was the scene for a stellar display from Rutherford. His jump of 8.08m in his second attempt had already ensured victory before his final effort, which saw him extend his lead further. \"It's been absolutely amazing to get you all out here in support of us,\" said Rutherford afterwards. \"It's been an incredibly difficult week for everybody and I'm so pleased we can come here and give you something to smile about and enjoy. \"Manchester is one of my favourite cities in the world to go to.

But the central bank said it expected the economy to need only \"gradual\" increases in the short term. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said the economic outlook was \"highly uncertain\" and the rise was only a \"modest shift\". However, the new Donald Trump administration could mean rates having to rise at a faster pace next year, she signalled at a news conference after the announcement. The president-elect has promised policies to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. A US rate rise - how am I affected? US rate rise: Should Asia worry? Ms Yellen said it was wrong to speculate on Mr Trump's economic strategy without more details. But she added that some members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, the body which sets rates, have factored in to their forecasts an increase in spending. As a consequence, the FOMC said it now expects three rate rises next year rather than the two that were predicted in September. Ms Yellen told the news conference: \"We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty... All the FOMC participants recognise that there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policy may change and what effect they may have on the economy.\" Also, she declined to be drawn on Mr Trump's public comments about the Fed, and his use of tweets to announce policy and criticise companies. \"I'm a strong believer in the independence of the Fed,\" she told journalists. \"I am not going to offer the incoming president advice.\" The interest rate move had been widely expected, and followed the last increase a year ago. Rates have been near zero since the global financial crisis. But the US economy is recovering, underlined by recent data on consumer confidence, jobs, house prices and growth in manufacturing and services. Ms Yellen said the rate rise \"should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress that the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue\". Although inflation is still below the Fed's 2% target, it expects the rise in prices to pick up gradually over the medium term. \"The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\" the Fed statement said. It added: \"The federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\" The Fed also published its economic forecasts for the next three years."}

Mr Dasuki, who oversaw the fight against Boko Haram while Goodluck Jonathan was president, denied the charges.

Her tomb was of black marble, with gilded letters and decoration. Mr Orme said: \"But Oliver Cromwell's soldiers stole the gilding during the sack of the cathedral in 1643, while a dean of the cathedral used the marble for the floor of his summerhouse in the 1700s.\" It was not until the late 19th Century that a wife of one of the cathedral canons, Katharine Clayton, started a public appeal asking all the Katharines of England to donate to the replacement marble slab which can be seen today.

Unless the Home Office opts in, the UK will lose membership by May 2017. The Lord Advocate is meeting MEPs and senior lawyers in Brussels on Wednesday. Writing in EurActiv, he said: \"I firmly believe that it would not be in the interests of Scotland, of the United Kingdom, or of Europe, if we were, as a result of the referendum result, to turn our back on the mechanisms of criminal justice co-operation. \"Indeed, I believe that we should remain a fully committed and active participant in these mechanisms - so that we can maximise our ability to contribute to their work, and to their future development.\" The UK must decide whether to opt into the new Europol regulation by the end of December 2016. Scotland's Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has urged the UK government to confirm it will do so. James Wolffe backed that call and said participation in Europol and Eurojust was in Scotland's vital interest. He said: \"Without them, the safety and security of our citizens will, in my view, be diminished. \"The threat posed, today, by transnational criminality is surely too urgent and real for us to contemplate any weakening of our commitment to police and judicial co-operation with our colleagues in Europe.\" Brandon Lewis, UK policing and fire minister, said: \"The prime minister has stated that law enforcement co-operation will continue when the UK is outside the EU and we will do what is necessary to keep our people safe. \"The government will take a decision on whether to opt-in to the new Europol regulation in due course. \"The UK remains a full member of Europol, and because of our justice and home affairs opt-in, we have the option to seek to opt-in to Europol's new legislative framework. This option remains open to us while we are a member of the EU.\" Since 2011, there have been 541 cases in Scottish courts in which proceedings were taken after an arrest on a European Arrest Warrant (EAW), which are carried out by Europol. A total of 367 individuals were extradited from Scotland through this procedure. In addition, the Crown Office has issued 45 EAWs to bring people back to Scotland quickly to face trial for serious crimes. In the past year the EAW system has been further enhanced within the UK by access to the Schengen Information System."}

Total sales fell 0.4%. Despite the drop, the UK's second-largest supermarket said it was continuing to make progress. Chief executive Mike Coupe said he was confident its strategy would enable it to \"outperform our major peers\". German discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which have expanded rapidly in the UK, have been undercutting Sainsbury's and its rivals, including Tesco, Morrisons and Asda. The supermarket chain has fought back by cutting prices on its everyday products rather than run promotions. This quarter, it said it had cut the prices of broccoli, onions, Margherita pizza and its own-brand nappies. Mr Coupe said this strategy was working with customers \"consistently choosing\" Sainsbury's over its rivals. He also said its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos-owner Home Retail Group, which was completed at the beginning of this month, would speed up its plans to allow shoppers to get their goods in different ways. Sainsbury's, which already has 15 Argos stores within its own shops, said it would open 200 digital collection points in its stores by the end of the year. The supermarket group said Home Retail Group's like-for-like sales in the second quarter to 27 August, before it took over the firm, rose 2.3%. In another attempt to win more shoppers, and amid the threat of online giant Amazon's move into grocery deliveries, Sainsbury's said it was expanding a test of its one-hour grocery delivery service in London called \"Chop Chop\" with orders delivered by bicycle. The retailer said it would \"give customers more options to shop with us whenever and wherever they want\". Sainsbury's has reported two straight years of falling profits, and analysts expect another drop in the 2016-17 financial year. In May, the supermarket said underlying profits for the year to 12 March fell to \u00a3587m from \u00a3681m in the previous year. Shares in the group have fallen 9% over the past six months. John Ibbotson, director of retail consultancy Retail Vision, said Sainsbury's simpler pricing strategy and abolition of multi-buy promotions was \"distinctly underwhelming\" in the current brutal market conditions, but said Argos could help the firm. \"Argos should boost Sainsbury's bottom line in the short-term as well as improve its internet offer and logistics capability. \"But integrating the two firms will be time-consuming and distracting, and in the current environment Sainsbury's cannot afford to take its eye off its core grocery business, even for a second,\" he added. Earlier this week, discount rival Aldi showed it was not immune to the effects of the continuing price war, with low prices eating into its profit margins."}

The default passwords and bad security practices could have leaked data to attackers, said the research teams. However, all four firms have acted on the warnings, tightened up code and closed loopholes. \"The problem with the Internet of Things these days is that everyone is becoming an IT shop whether they like it or not and whether they realise it or not,\" said Tod Beardsley, security research manager at Rapid7, who uncovered problems with two of the devices. While IoT device makers were writing code more confidently, few took the extra design steps to make sure the programming they put into smart devices was secure, the researchers found. Mr Beardsley checked the security in two devices from separate firms: The way the bear communicated with the web was poorly configured, he found, so attackers could have interrogated it to find out more about its young owner, their family and home network. Similar problems were found with the HereO watch that could have let an attacker add themselves to a group of watches used by a family or other group. HereO's chief technology officer said his team fixed the flaw within four hours of being alerted to it. \"We not only appreciate Rapid7's feedback, but also welcome and embrace the valuable support of the global IoT [internet of things] community in our relentless efforts to maintain a bar-none, zero-tolerance environment for the safety and security of our users,\" said Eli Shemesh. \"As HereO at the time had yet to commercialise its GPS watches, at no point was any child at risk of any malicious activity.\" Separately, researchers at Context IS uncovered security issues with a Motorola Focus outdoor camera. If exploited, the lapses could allow a camera to be taken over and remotely controlled by an attacker and used as an entrance to infiltrate a network to which it was connected. Security experts at Pentest Partners also found problems with Ring - a smart doorbell fitted with a video camera that uses an app to beam video of callers to a phone. But by removing the cover of the gadget and pressing its set-up key it becomes possible to recover the key to the wi-fi network to which it is joined, found the security testing firm. All the security failings found by the researchers were reported to the respective firms and all have now been patched or fixed.

Oil-rich Venezuela has been hit hard by the global drop in oil prices and suffers from high inflation and a chronic shortage of basic goods. Several airline companies have said that currency controls in Venezuela made it impossible for airlines to convert their earnings into dollars and send the money abroad. In a statement, Latam airlines said it would suspend its operations to Caracas airport \"temporarily and for an unspecified time\". It said flights on its Sao Paulo to Caracas route would end first, within days, and the other routes it runs to Caracas from Lima and Santiago would be halted by the end of July. Strict currency controls were first imposed in Venezuela in 2003 by late President Hugo Chavez. The restrictions were further tightened two years ago, forcing several airlines to reduce their operations in the country as they struggled to repatriate billions of dollars in revenue held in the local currency - the bolivar. Some airlines are now requiring passengers to pay their fares in dollars. Venezuela's government says it is using its foreign reserves - which are now scarce - to pay for essential items such as medicines and industrial machinery. Recently Coca-Cola said it would be halting production of some of its soft drinks because of a lack of sugar while the tyre and rubber products company Bridgestone also ended its more than 60-year relationship with the country."}

Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said Todt and Ecclestone refused to revert to the 2015 system despite teams' wishes to do so. A new aggregate system proposed by the FIA will be discussed again next week. Lewis Hamilton qualified fastest for Sunday's race in Bahrain, but there were quiet periods near the end of the first and second sessions when there were no cars out on the track. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said all parties had agreed that the new system introduced on the eve of the 2016 season - where the slowest car is eliminated every 90 seconds in three sessions - was not the way forward. Horner said: \"There is an unwillingness from the promoter and FIA to go back to 2015. The teams would go back. A compromise has been put on the table now for the teams to consider. \"Let's have a look at what's been out on the table today. The bottom line is if we don't agree to a compromise, then we're stuck with what we've got and everybody agrees that what we've got isn't right.\" Horner and Wolff both said they did not know why Ecclestone and Todt were so opposed to reverting to the 2015 system, whereby all eligible cars ran to the end of a session before the slowest few in each are knocked out, gradually reducing the number of cars over the three sessions. Todt said in a news conference on Saturday that race promoters had asked for a different system because they feared the 2015 approach was not exciting enough. Ecclestone has made it clear he wants to find a way to shuffle the grids so that the fastest cars are not always at the front. Horner said that the proposal was for a reversion to the 2015 format, but with each drivers' two fastest laps being counted towards their grid position rather than just their fastest. Horner said the plan \"needed a bit more investigation, perhaps with an aggregate time of two laps rather than a single lap.

But the region risks losing that chance because of lukewarm backing for national candidates at home, and a regional failure to pull together to back one individual. An informal selection procedure, made more transparent this year by open hearings, has produced 11 candidates so far, eight of them from Eastern Europe. The former or current foreign ministers of Moldova, Macedonia, Montenegro, Croatia, Serbia and Slovakia, plus the former president of Slovenia are all in the race. Bulgaria has proposed Irina Bokova, current head of Unesco, the cultural and educational wing of the UN. The other New York race Helen Clark to run for UN top job Close observers at the UN say the candidates risk crowding each other out - leaving the way open for other strong candidates including Susana Malcorra of Argentina, Helen Clark from New Zealand, or the tough-talking former UNHCR head, Antonio Guterres from Portugal. In July, a straw poll among the 15 members of the Security Council should give a clearer idea of the backing, or lack of support, for each. Even more candidates could also step forward in the coming weeks. Another Bulgarian stateswoman, Kristalena Georgieva, is widely rumoured to be on the brink of announcing her candidacy. \"I am obviously watching the race closely. A lot of people are urging me to enter. Let's see what happens,\" she told the BBC. Behind the scenes, several countries are said to be considering nominating her. Ms Bokova was an early frontrunner, and enjoyed crucial Russian backing. But her chances have been harmed by a damning investigation of the inner workings of Unesco in recent months, and by her support for Palestinian statehood - frowned on by the US government. Nearly half of Unesco's budget currently goes on staff salaries. By way of contrast, Ms Georgieva has a strong record as an administrator at the World Bank, and as a former EU commissioner for humanitarian affairs and current commissioner for budgetary affairs. In recent months, she led the team overseeing a new blueprint for UN humanitarian interventions which concluded that $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3710m) a year could be saved by directing funds directly to those in need. More information on the candidates and the selection procedure is available on the UN's website \"Insiders say that either Kristalena Georgieva or Antonio Guterres could give the UN the kind of kick up the backside it needs,\" said Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. There is a consensus that the next leader of the UN should be a good manager with experience of running international organisations."}

Investigations at the atomic scale indicate the cement ought to retain this ability for at least 2,000 years. The Sheffield University team believes the new mix is up to 50% better than previously proposed barrier solutions. At some point the government will choose the location of an underground store for the hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of waste built up over more than 60 years of nuclear operations. A lot of this material will be immobilised and backfilled using cement. This cement will need to block the passage of radioisotopes far into the future. The Sheffield experiments have been performed at the Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire. This is the UK's big synchrotron, which shoots X-rays into samples to reveal their structure on the smallest scales. Diamond now has a lab - or beamline, as it is called - that is specifically given over to long-duration studies. It has allowed Dr Claire Corkhill and colleagues to probe the changing properties of different mixes of cement over the past 18 months. \"We've been able to gather some very high-resolution data, and this has allowed us to make some predictive models so that we can understand what phases are forming, and when, out to 2,000 years, which is exactly when we expect water to start interacting with a geological disposal facility,\" said the scientist from Sheffield's NucleUS research group. Their optimum cement - known currently simply as No7 - contains blast-furnace slag. The sulphides this introduces react with water to produce sulphate mineral phases that are exceptionally good at sorbing technetium-99. \"It's a high-yield fission product; it's only found in nuclear reactors; it's very mobile in the environment - but what we found is that our cement will actually lock tight this technetium-99 into its structure and prevent it being transported into the environment,\" explained Dr Corkhill. The team's investigations show No7 to be a much better performer than the currently proposed cement barrier, called Nirex Reference Vault Backfill. But this is not the end of the story - further mixes are being investigated to find even more effective solutions. The cement work has been discussed here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) - as has the long-duration experiment facility at Diamond. It is the only one of its kind in the world, and was set up specifically to permit scientists to study the temporal behaviour of materials. Researchers put their samples on a robotic bench and then leave the machine to it."}

Relatives of the victims have long demanded justice saying the nursery did not comply with safety regulations. But a lawyer for the relatives said the warrants targeted the wrong people. Prosecutors asked a judge to issue the arrest warrants for the director of the nursery and some of its management and teachers. Gabriel Alvarado, a lawyer for the relatives' group Hands United for Our Children called the move \"erroneous\" arguing it did not target the officials responsible for the tragedy. He said it could punish those who had risked their own lives, and in some cases had suffered injuries, trying to save the children. Mr Alvarado added that one of the teachers who could face arrest has a daughter who suffered burns to 95% of her body in the fire. \"This girl could now see her own mother taken to prison,\" he said. The fire started at a warehouse in the city of Hermosillo on 5 June 2009. The flames quickly spread over a roof to the adjoining nursery, where the children where having their afternoon siesta. The nursery did not have a sprinkler system or any fire extinguishers. The smoke alarms were faulty and the staff were poorly trained. Victims' relatives argue that the tragedy could have been prevented if the right safety measures had been in place. They also point to the fact that a nursery should not have been housed in a building adjacent to one storing tyres and flammable materials. They are angry that while dozens of officials were put on trial, only the government official who carried out the nursery's final safety inspection has spent any time in jail. Their anger is further compounded by a media report published last year alleging that the fire in the warehouse may have been deliberately caused to get rid of compromising local government documents stored there.

The PIDG said it had revised its travel policy, which had seen board members claiming for more expensive flexible business class tickets. But Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the Department for International Development (DfID) was to blame for not keeping a tight enough rein on spending. \"It's outrageous that 15 flights were booked from 2011, each costing over \u00a35,000,\" said Mrs Hodge. \"Only this month has PIDG revised its travel policy. DfID should get a grip on administrative costs like this.\" The PIDG was founded in 2002 by four countries - the UK, Switzerland, Holland and Sweden - to back private investment in infrastructure projects in developing countries, including roads, telecoms, sanitation, housing, agriculture, power and industry. But the UK provides 70% of its funding, which is expected to hit \u00a3700m in total by 2015. UK funding for the agency was increased fivefold by the coalition government in 2011, in line with its policy of encouraging private investment in the developing world. But the NAO found much of that money had yet to be spent on development projects and the PIDG Trust was sitting on \u00a327m in its bank account. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: \"The Private Infrastructure Development Group is providing important benefits to poor people in difficult environments, but DfID does not have enough good evidence to show that funding PIDG is the best option. \"Furthermore, DfID's financial control has been lacking, allowing the PIDG Trust to hold nearly \u00a327m worth of DfID funding since 2012. \"The department has recently made good progress in tackling these issues, which will put it in a better position to demonstrate value for money, but I consider that it should have taken more action earlier given its decision in 2011 to increase funding for PIDG fivefold.\" The report also criticises two of the agency's subsidiaries, GuarantCo and the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF), set up by then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2002, which are incorporated in the tax haven of Mauritius. This arrangement has come in from criticism from War on Want, which claims it flies in the face of Prime Minister David Cameron's commitment to tax justice for poor countries.

Northern Ireland could also potentially be included in the discussions. \"I can imagine a situation where some parts of what is today the member state United Kingdom are stripped out and others remain,\" Mr Picardo told Newsnight. \"That means that we don't have to apply again for access, we simply remain with the access we have today, and those parts that leave are then given a different sort of access, which is negotiated but not necessarily under Article 50,\" he said, referring to a provision in the Lisbon Treaty that sets out how a member state can voluntarily leave the Union. There is a precedent for such a proposal. Denmark joined what was then the EEC in 1973, the same year as the UK and Ireland. Greenland gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979 and seceded from the EU in 1985, following a referendum three years earlier. Nicola Sturgeon has previously said that a second referendum on independence for Scotland is \"highly likely\", following last Thursday's Leave victory. More than 95% of Gibraltarians voted for Remain on Thursday. The vast majority also want to remain in the UK. The territory overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to share sovereignty with Spain in a referendum in 2002. Mr Picardo insisted Gibraltar's status as a British Overseas Territory should not mean giving up its membership of the EU. \"The position of the people of Gibraltar is that we've expressed, perhaps even more clearly than the Scots, what our view is going forward, what should happen - that we should continue to have access to the single market to the European Union. My obligation is to protect and promote the interests of Gibraltar and to find such partners who may be willing to do the same thing within the United Kingdom.\" Following the referendum last week, Spain again raised the issue of joint sovereignty of Gibraltar. \"The Spanish flag on the Rock is much closer than before,\" Spain's acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said on Friday. But speaking in his first broadcast interview since the referendum on Thursday, Fabian Picardo said any claims by Spain to the territory would be dismissed out of hand. \"Anybody who thinks that this is a time to propose joint sovereignty or that they're going to get any millimetre of advantage in respect of the sovereignty of Gibraltar is completely wrong."}

I'm not sure that many of us would quite know what to do when handed a giant vegetable in front of a pack of photographers. But it won't be surprising to see it all over the newspapers and stuck in people's memories. And it was a reminder that before Mr Corbyn even tries to win the battles he will certainly face this week - over nuclear weapons, over how to balance the country's books, or over the way Labour makes its decisions - his team's priority must be, get through the week without mishap. For party conferences are strange, intense, microclimates where the what is said on the stage, however carefully crafted or considered, can be subsumed by our old friends, \"events\", however silly. And sometimes those are the moments that shift opinion, or express a truth political parties don't want to contemplate. And occasionally, they are the moments senior politicians lose control. In 2003 I remember seeing Conservative aides grimace during the then leader Iain Duncan Smith's speech, as he promised the \"quiet man\" was \"turning up the volume\". That week, everywhere Conservatives had been huddled in corners wondering how to unseat him. His strangely delivered speech contributed to his ultimate exit. In 2006 I remember Cherie Blair's unguarded, and then denied remark, whizzed round the conference centre in 2006, when she cried out \"it's a lie\" when Gordon Brown heaped praise on her husband. Nothing expressed the levels of bitterness between the two camps so well. In 2008, it wasn't just the rather silly picture of him clutching a banana that put David Miliband onto the front pages, but that he'd been overheard talking of avoiding a \"Heseltine moment\". His leadership ambitions were what made the conference banana moment worth printing. The year before, when Sir Menzies Campbell was already under attack for lacklustre leadership of the Liberal Democrats, I recall the uncomfortable press visit to an environmentally friendly house outside Bournemouth, where aides allowed him to be photographed while inspecting an organic toilet. Awkward didn't begin to cover it. Unfair perhaps, but that moment suggested all that what was wrong with his party machine, and weeks later he was gone. There is so much at stake for the Labour Party this week, that Jeremy Corbyn's \"marrow moment\" may be quickly forgotten. The point is, to have a hope of sticking to his agenda, the first priority for Team Corbyn may be avoiding mishaps. In the frantic environment of conference, much more experienced political teams have lost complete control of events."}

Overton, who was unused by England in last week's three-game T20 series with South Africa despite being called up to the squad, bowled a crucial spell to turn the tide. With Liam Dawson (53) and Adams going well in their patient opening stand, the fast bowler found the latter's outside edge before Rossouw top-edged through to Steven Davies to go for a fifth duck in his last eight County Championship innings. Dawson fell lbw soon after to Lewis Gregory (3-51) and, despite James Vince's 47, Hampshire's batting fell apart as Leach's accurate left-arm spin gave nothing away. With a batting point secured, Hampshire captain George Bailey declared, but Marcus Trescothick (10 not out) and debutant Eddie Byrom, who was unbeaten on one, had no troubles reaching stumps under the floodlights.

It seems never ending. In less than a year two Malaysian aircraft have been lost, with 537 people on board. The AirAsia accident - en route to Singapore in December - killed 162. It is not just the accidents. It's the fact that whole aircraft are going down without warning. You would be forgiven for thinking that flying is becoming more lethal. But you would be wrong. In fact, when you look at the number of crashes and fatalities compared to the huge number of people flying today (3.2 billion passengers last year), we are in a golden era of aircraft safety. According to safety analysts Ascend, 2014 was narrowly the safest year ever, with one fatal accident per 2.38 million flights, compared to every 1.91 million flights the year before. It must be noted that that does not include the loss of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, where 298 people died, which they count as a war loss rather than an accident. But even with that flight added it is not a terrible year, historically. Another respected organisation, the Aviation Safety Network, registers 21 fatal accidents in 2014 (this time including Ukraine), compared to 29 in 2013 and 23 the year before that. Nearly 1,000 people died in 2014, which is 700 more than the year before. Horrible numbers, but compare that to the worst year, 1972, when 2,370 passengers were killed - and far fewer people were flying then, maybe a quarter of the number travelling today. So why is flying getting safer? Well, technology. \"Think of your car in the 1970s\", David Learmount, from Flightglobal tells me. \"The brakes, the handling, the lack of safety features. Well, aircraft are exactly the same. \"We knew most things about aerodynamics by the 1940s. What has changed is the technology.\" Every new generation of aircraft has been safer than the one before. Better computers, design, materials. But there is another sobering factor at play here too. Every tragedy has taught designers something new. Go back a couple of decades and the biggest killer was something called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). A benign name with a morbid outcome, it normally involved a perfectly serviceable aircraft coming into land, then hitting something on the ground without the crew even knowing it was there. Many airports are near hills. Then along came a piece of equipment that was to transform safety: the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. \"It's like a sat nav that can help you thread your way through hills and mountains, even in clouds\", David says."}

He had been in custody since 10 April when, according to North Korean sources, he destroyed his tourist visa and demanded asylum. The youngest of four sons, he grew up in Bakersfield, California, and both his parents were oil engineers. Described by former classmates as \"quiet but extremely intelligent\", he learnt Korean on his first trip to South Korea four years ago while visiting a brother stationed there with the US air force. A California neighbour said he liked it so much he stayed. Notes produced in court, apparently in Mr Miller's handwriting, suggested he had become a fugitive because he was involved with Wikileaks, the organisation that leaked US state secrets. However, the BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says it is unclear if they were written under duress or not, and if any of the allegations were true. In an interview this month with CNN, attended by North Korean officials, Mr Miller said: \"I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here.\" He also said he deliberately committed his \"crime\", without specifying what he had done wrong. The charges he faced in trial were non-specified. Mr Bae, a Korean-American known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho, was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China. He has been described as both a tour operator and Christian missionary. North Korea said he used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May 2013. Mr Bae's trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test. So far efforts to secure his release have been unsuccessful. His family say he has several health complaints including diabetes and liver problems.

This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline."}

Presently, the president and vice-president are limited to two consecutive five-year terms. Mr Morales, who has been in power since 2006, and his supporters wanted him to be able to run for another term. With almost all the votes counted, the \"No\" camp had a narrow but irreversible lead over those favouring another term for Mr Morales. This means the constitutional ban on serving more than two consecutive five-year terms remains in place. Despite the constitutional ban on serving more than two consecutive terms, President Evo Morales was allowed to run for a third term in 2014. The constitutional court argued that the ban did not apply to Mr Morales' initial term because it had taken place before the new constitution came into effect. Mr Morales will now not be able to stand in presidential elections in 2019. But he is expected to continue serving out the remainder of his term, which ends in 2020. When provisional results suggested a win for the \"No\" campaign, Mr Morales said that \"the fight will continue\" and his administration would follow through with its plans. Critics within his party hope he will start training up a potential successor, while opposition politicians see it as a chance to challenge the governing parties. Mr Morales said he had \"lost a battle, but not the war\". There were celebrations in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, an opposition stronghold. Many opposition politicians and some within Mr Morales's party said the outcome was a victory for democracy. Former President Carlos Mesa said it showed that \"no one is indispensable\". Samuel Doria Medina, who lost three times to Mr Morales in presidential elections said that Bolivia had won. \"They [the government] called this referendum and the people told them 'no',\" he tweeted. Mr Morales won the presidential election with 61% of the vote last year. There is still widespread support for Mr Morales and his economic programme but many felt a change to the constitution was a step too far. Some within the ranks of his own party also felt it was time for new, younger politicians to be given a chance to run. The president's approval ratings were also hurt by recent allegations that he used his influence to favour a Chinese construction firm which employs his former girlfriend. Mr Morales rejected the allegations and said he had nothing to hide. He ordered an investigation into how the contracts were awarded."}

But they say they have not proved their \"causal connection\" with the crash. MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board. There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner. About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia. Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame. How a missile could have brought down MH17 MH17: What we know A tale of two sisters and flight MH17 Air disaster that touched a nation The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been \"secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine\". \"The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts,\" the statement said. Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system. \"We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17,\" he added. \"If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough.\" The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash. The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile. The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system. The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture."}

Published in the Lancet Psychiatry, their analysis of 61 separate studies suggests nicotine in cigarette smoke may be altering the brain. Experts said it was a \"pretty strong case\" but needed more research. Smoking has long been associated with psychosis, but it has often been believed that schizophrenia patients are more likely to smoke because they use cigarettes as a form of self-medication to ease the distress of hearing voices or having hallucinations. The team at King's looked at data involving 14,555 smokers and 273,162 non-smokers. It indicated: The argument is that if there is a higher rate of smoking before schizophrenia is diagnosed, then smoking is not simply a case of self-medication. Dr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's, said: \"It's very difficult to establish causation [with this style of study], what we're hoping that this does is really open our eyes to the possibility that tobacco could be a causative agent in psychosis, and we hope this will then lead to other research and clinical trials that would help to provide firmer evidence.\" Clearly most smokers do not develop schizophrenia, but the researchers believe it is increasing the risk. The overall incidence of the condition is one in every 100 people normally, which may be increased to two per 100 by smoking. The researchers said nicotine altered levels of the brain chemical dopamine, which has already been implicated in the psychosis. Prof Michael Owen, the director of the Institute of Psychological Medicine at Cardiff University, said the researchers had made a \"pretty strong case\" that smoking may increase the risk of schizophrenia. \"The fact is that it is very hard to prove causation without a randomised trial, but there are plenty of good reasons already for targeting public health measures very energetically at the mentally ill.\" The charity Rethink Mental Illness said: \"We know that 42% of all cigarettes smoked in England are by people with mental health problems, and so any new findings about the link between smoking and psychosis is a potential worry. \"However, longer-term studies are needed to fully understand this potential link.\""}

Opinion is sharply divided, however, as to whether or not it is wise to invest in the country. Since 2004, its economy has been expanding by about 10% a year. The government expects growth to continue in double digits - but a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests it will slow to 6.5% in 2013. Even the IMF predictions are impressive, however, considering the current global financial climate and the fact that unlike many other countries on the continent, Ethiopia does not have much in the way of natural resources. Coffee is one of the biggest export earners in Ethiopia. In Addis Ababa, the country's capital, coffee exporter Michael Girma says it was a challenge to launch his business. \"To start up in the export sector, you need to perform with your own cash. Then after that, you can approach the banks,\" he says. Apart from exporting coffee, he now also owns a cafe, a bar, and a pizzeria, employing 140 people altogether. Although the business environment is getting very competitive, he is achieving a profit margin of 20-30% each year and feels confident about the future. \"A lot has changed in the last seven years,\" he says. \"You need to be aggressive, but not arrogant.\" Although foreign investors are encouraged, many sectors are reserved for domestic investors. \"The restricted sectors are those which supply to the local people. If foreign investors want to come in and invest in projects which are export oriented, anything is open,\" he says. \"It would be very hard to compete otherwise.\" Despite annual high inflation, some investors think the potential in Africa's second most populous nation has not been recognised. Earlier this year, Shultze Global Investments launched a $100m equity fund aiming to invest in Ethiopian businesses. In a nondescript building on a hillside overlooking Addis Ababa, Berhane Demissie decides where to put that money. \"Ethiopia offers significant opportunities for investors,\" she says, pointing out that agriculture is a strong growth sector. \"Anything grows in Ethiopia with the various climate and soil diversities that we have. That also follows through to the agricultural value-added chain with processing and exports,\" Ms Demissie says. With 85% of the population dependent on the agricultural sector, she says the government is trying to ensure those farmers have access to finance and fertilisers that will allow them to grow more.

The channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit. It's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves. India may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac Speaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians. He said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India. \"It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,\" he said. There is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete. While officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper. Most schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac While stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed. He hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family."}

The couple, who live in Newham, acted after accusing Kristy of controlling and adversely influencing a young boy, the jury was told. They originally came from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where witchcraft is called Kindoki, and exorcisms are carried out in some churches. In 2010, Unicef reported 20,000 children accused of witchcraft were living on the streets of DR Congo's capital Kinshasa. In the DR Congo, accusing a child of being possessed is a criminal offence, a law that has been in place for several years. But in 2008 I travelled to Kinshasa to see if it was making any difference and, at that time, the answer was not at all. Which is why I found myself in one of the city's slums late at night knocking on the door of tin-roofed shack that doubled as a church. Pastor Tsimba let me in and showed me three children who he had diagnosed as having Kindoki. The youngest was probably six, the oldest no more than 12. They had been in the church for days, deprived of food and forced to work. Their parents were paying for the privilege. The only light came from flickering candles and storm lamps. The pastor began to shout and pray. One by one he brought the children up to the front of the church. He ordered them to lie down and, still shouting and chanting, began slapping their stomachs, one, two, three times. Each harder than the last. Then he took a candle and poured burning hot wax on them, leaving them grimacing and squirming but making almost no sound. Their eyes were wide and staring. Finally, as a bizarre conclusion to the ritual, Pastor Tsimba produced a length of pipe and held it hard against their belly buttons. One after another, he made a play of sucking hard on the pipe and in triumph then spat a lump of meat he claimed to have sucked out of them into a bowl. The meat he claimed had been been fed to them by a witch, infecting them with Kindoki. The children, bewildered and quiet, were now in his words \"delivered\". I alerted a social worker to the plight of the children. An extraordinary and dedicated man, he said he would do all he could to help them. But his unit had not paid him for months, there was no money for petrol or even a bus fare. So he did his work on foot."}

It was a long time ago, but he still crosses the road if a large group of people are coming his way. After all, everyone in his family has been targeted in a similar fashion. France's ethnic Chinese population have long suffered casual racism and been stereotyped as easy targets for crime. But they say they have now reached breaking point. In August, 49-year-old tailor and father-of-two Zhang Chaolin died in hospital after being attacked by three teenagers. He had been walking in a quiet street in the north Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. Zhang was reportedly kicked in the sternum and fell, striking his head on the pavement. The aim of the attack was allegedly to steal his friend's bag. The tailor had nothing on him except sweets and cigarettes. In response, on 4 September, at least 15,000 ethnic Chinese turned out in Paris's Place de la Republique to give vent to their deep feelings of insecurity. Estimated at more than 600,000 people, France has Europe's largest Chinese community. But they have not been in the country as long as more prominent migrant groups, including those from Africa. David was born in Paris to parents who migrated from China in the early 1990s. He says he has been asked publicly if he eats dogs, and has been called a \"spring roll head\". He has also been told to \"go back to his own country\" and \"go and work with his little Chinese hands\". Such jibes might be familiar to east Asian migrants and their descendants across the West. As with British Chinese, French Chinese say that racist comments toward them are tolerated, in a way that they are not for more established migrant communities. But in France, there is a sense that Asian migrants are targeted with particularly nasty violence. \"[These attacks] are because of the beliefs they have about us,\" says David, who is too fearful to use his real name. A working-class and immigrant-heavy area, home to more than 1,200 mostly Chinese wholesalers, Aubervilliers is an important European textile centre. Buyers come from far and wide to haggle over Italian-made coats and Chinese-made shirts. Activists say at least 100 attacks against Chinese nationals were reported in the suburb in just the first seven months of this year. France does not keep statistics based on ethnicity, so it is difficult to know the real number of incidents. Meriem Derkaoui, the suburb's communist mayor, condemned Zhang's murder as \"racist targeting\"."}

But the year marked an important milestone when - aged just 22 - he broke the 800m, one mile and 1,500m world records within the space of just 41 days. He was the first person to hold all three records at the same time. He also won Sports Personality of the Year. 1980 - First Olympic medals Coe will always be remembered for his Olympic success. In 1980, amid intense rivalry with fellow British runner Steve Ovett, he won gold in the 1,500m in Moscow. He took silver in his preferred race - the 800m - finishing second to Ovett. 1984 - Second Olympic Gold Despite spending months fighting illness, Coe returned to the Olympic track in Los Angeles four years later and became the first man to win successive 1,500m golds, beating fellow Briton Steve Cram into second (Ovett failed to finish the race). Coe was beaten into second again in the 800m by Joaquim Cruz. 1992 - Enters Parliament After retiring from athletics in 1990, Coe pursued a career in politics and was chosen to fight the Falmouth and Camborne constituency for the Conservatives at the 1992 election. Coe beat the Liberal Democrat candidate by more than 3,000 votes and took his place in Parliament. He lost the seat in 1997 when Tony Blair's Labour Party swept to power. He briefly returned to politics as chief of staff to William Hague, when he was Leader of the Opposition. 2005 - Helps secure Olympics for London Despite London lagging in third place behind Paris and Madrid in early stages, the UK capital secured the games under Coe's leadership. Sports commentators said a speech he made, shortly before the vote, helped turn the race in London's favour. \"This is almost entirely on a different planet to winning the gold medals,\" Coe said at the time. He went on to become Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and is said to have been a key player in organising the Queen's appearance in the James Bond scene in the Games' opening ceremony. 2015 - Elected president of the IAAF Despite one of the most impressive CVs in athletics history, Lord Coe suggested his election as IAAF chief topped all his achievements.

Mulbah broke the deadlock in a goalmouth scramble on 58 minutes and completed the rout after Sarkoh punished a blunder from Algeria goalkeeper Malek Asselah. The unexpectedly heavy loss for Kabylie was another blow to Algerian football, after the Desert Foxes were eliminated from the recent Africa Cup of Nations at the group phase.

Based on a photo in Mao's Little Red Book, the portrait series is among the most famous images of the 20th Century. The auction of this work is expected to fetch as much as $15m (\u00a312.1m). This particular Mao portrait was sold in 2014 in London for \u00a37.6m ($9.4m) and the current owner, who is not identified, has now put it up for sale with Sotheby's in Hong Kong, with the auction expected on 2 April. Warhol began his series of silk-screen portraits of Mao in 1972 when ties between then cold-war foes China and US began to thaw after the historic trip to Beijing by US President Richard Nixon. The photograph that Warhol used for the portrait was one that adorned the inside cover of the so-called Little Red Book, itself an symbol of Chinese communism and a work of propaganda. More than a billion copies are thought to have been published, making the book one of the most widely produced of all time. During Mao's reign it became virtually mandatory to own and carry a copy. Warhol's Mao series led to almost 200 portraits in similar versions and sizes and follows the artist's similar earlier works on Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley in the 1960s. Picking Mao was a departure from his trademark of elevating a banal commodity (as he did with Campbell soup) or illuminating glamour (as he did with Marilyn Monroe). Chairman Mao was a political leader both deeply revered and feared and certainly an unlikely subject for the bold colour contrasts of the Pop Art movement. But it remains a delicate issue in China to this day. In a 2013 exhibition, the first comprehensive survey of Warhol's art in China, the Mao portraits were nowhere to be seen. The debate in Chinese media at the time was around whether the images were showing respect or mockery. Yet Chinese investors are increasingly buying Western art. They are thought to make up one fifth of the world's buyers of art. Downward pressure on the yuan and caps on capital outflows are only adding to the appetite for investing on the global art scene. So Warhol's portrait of China's former Communist leader may yet find its way to China through the workings of global capital markets. Reporting by the BBC's Andreas Illmer."}

The Queen's unguarded comments are atypical for her, but also pose some unanswered questions about the visit. In short, we don't know. Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi was \"seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese\", according to the Lord Chamberlain, who introduced her to the Queen. Commander D'Orsi said it \"was quite a testing time\" and that \"they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off\". The Queen clearly knew all about the incident concerned and interjected: \"They were very rude to the ambassador.\" \"They walked out on both of us,\" replied Ms D'Orsi. Did Ms D'Orsi mean that Chinese officials threatened to cancel the whole state visit? Or just part of the itinerary? Was any conflict to do with security arrangements (as Ms D'Orsi was clearly under pressure) or of wider diplomatic significance? We simply do not know. The police have not issued any statement. President Xi and his wife Madame Peng were guests of the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace for the state visit so perhaps it is to be expected that the Queen would be aware of such details. The Metropolitan Police had to defend itself from human rights groups' accusations that it dealt inappropriately with protesters during Mr Xi's visit in October 2015. Commander D'Orsi issued a statement in the immediate aftermath of the visit saying she was disappointed at hearing the view expressed that the Met was \"working to the bidding of the Chinese to suppress protest\". The Queen's comments were picked up by the microphone of the camera filming the garden party event, operated by Peter Wilkinson, the monarch's official cameraman His footage was released to broadcasters under the \"pool\" arrangement which is standard procedure for royal events (to avoid all broadcasters sending their own crews to every engagement). It was only then that the uncharacteristically undiplomatic comments were spotted. Indeed. At the time Mr Xi said he believed his visit would lift UK-China relations to a \"new height\". Buckingham Palace would not comment on a \"private conversation\" but said all parties worked closely to ensure the visit proceeded smoothly. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said the president's trip to the UK was very successful and \"marked the start of the Golden Era between China and the UK\".

The visitors, boosted by six returning Scotland internationals and seeking a first away win over Leinster since 2011, broke the deadlock in the 13th minute, with a multi-phase attack that finished with the 19-year-old prop Fagerson muscling over from close range. Weir's conversion was quickly followed by McFadden's first successful penalty. A second right-sided kick from the winger closed the gap to one by the 21st minute, rewarding Aaron Dundon for a well-won ruck penalty and accurate line-out throw in the build-up. Weir then punished Leinster for collapsing an advancing maul, punching over a fine 43-metre strike. He repeated the trick from the opposite left wing as Mike McCarthy infringed at a maul six minutes before the interval. Leinster missed a chance to close out the first half with a third penalty, McFadden wobbling an injury-time effort wide after Pat MacArthur saw yellow for a 'reckless' forearm-led tackle that ended Dundon's involvement in the game. The home side made their numerical advantage count on the resumption. Scrum-half McGrath's blindside switch led to Garry Ringrose racing up the right touchline and following a bout of forward pressure, McGrath stretched over for McFadden to convert. Leinster were only level for six minutes, the Scots hitting back with a terrific spell of attacking and a power-packed finish to the right of the posts by big Fijian Naiyaravoro. But the hosts took the lead for the first time through the penalty try. Replacement Isaac Boss exploited a gap and Isa Nacewa's well-weighted kick set up a foot race between McFadden and Naiyaravoro. The latter was deemed to have deliberately slapped the ball over the end-line as the pair lunged for the ball. After consulting with the TMO, referee Ian Davies awarded the penalty try and sin-binned the Fijian, with McFadden's conversion splitting the sides on the scoreboard.

Lochte's performance at Rio did not reach the heights of his London triumph, but Forbes estimated his endorsements would still have been between $1m-$2m. The saga started when Lochte and three team-mates returned to the Olympic village after a late night out in Rio. They tried, unsuccessfully, to use the locked toilet at a garage and urinated outside instead. After first claiming that he and his three team-mates had been robbed by bogus policemen, Lochte back-tracked and admitted he had, while still drunk, \"left details out\" and \"over-exaggerated some parts of the story\". Despite the evidence against him, including CCTV footage, he has however denied that he actually lied in his initial account to Brazilian police. Lochte's behaviour has been met with disdain in the US and he has been widely pilloried in the US media. On 19 August the New York Post carried a front-page headline describing him as the \"Ugly American\", along with the slogan \"Liar, Liar, Speedo on fire\"."}

Guildford in Surrey was the least deprived town. The study considered factors such as income, employment, health, education, skills and training and crime. It also looked at disability, access to housing and the built environment in cities and towns in England and Wales. The north-west of England had five of the ten most deprived towns and cities, while the West Midlands had three of the top five. The data revealed that while Oldham was the most deprived overall, West Bromwich came off the worst for employment and income. The town in Sandwell was ranked the lowest out of 109 areas for both aspects and second lowest for education. Where are the most and least happy places in England? Birmingham was also given the lowest ranking for housing. At the opposite end of the table, Guildford, Woking and St Albans were all found to have the highest proportion of the least deprived areas. The study by the ONS also revealed 29 out of 45 towns and cities in southern England had an average house price of more than \u00a3200,000, compared with only three out of 64 in the North and Midlands. Through research looking at England and Wales, the ONS found house prices have risen the most in Cambridge since 2010, increasing 47%. Swansea saw prices decrease 4% over the same period. The cheapest place to buy a home is Burnley in Lancashire, according to the ONS. A detached home goes for an average of \u00a3166,000 while a semi-detached attracts about \u00a3120,000. Flats go for an average of \u00a369,950 while terraced houses are priced at an average of \u00a354,498, making the overall average \u00a378,000.

They found evidence of common UK accent changes, such as the use of \"f\" for \"th\" in words like think, and a dropped letter 'l', as in people to peopo. Overall though, the researchers said the Scots accent remained distinctive. The three-year Sounds of the City study, was led by Professor Jane Stuart-Smith, director of the university's laboratory of phonetics. \"We were quite surprised by what we found,\" she said. \"The assumption is that traditional dialects generally across the UK are being eroded and some are dying out altogether, but what we have learned, particularly with the Glasgow accent, is that Scots accents are actually flourishing. \"Interestingly, what is not happening in Scotland is the dilution of accents to a more homogenised anglicised accent on the scale that we are seeing in England, and in fact the Scots accent remains very distinctive.\" As part of its study, the Glasgow team built up a digitised body of recorded speech sounds. The team said its work suggested the distinctive Scots accent had undergone two kinds of changes. One set are common accent changes, which have spread right across the UK, such as the \"f\" and \"l\" examples. The team said this change was being spread partly by dialect contact and partly by the popularity of TV shows set in London. The project also uncovered a second set of finer changes local to Scotland. These included how vowels were pronounced in words such as boat, goat and coat, or stop sounds that are pronounced in words like pin, top and cat. The researchers anticipated these sounds either to be stable over time, or perhaps to be changing in the same way as in Anglo-English accents. Their evidence suggested, however, that these features and others were all changing, the changes were local to Scotland and not affected by Anglo-English changes, and that they had been happening for 100 years or more. The Glasgow team said the trigger for some of these changes appeared to be the period around the First World War. The study focused on six audio recordings, made in 1916 and held by the British Library, of Scots soldiers from German Prisoner of War camps. From those recordings researchers found evidence to show that even a century ago, and perhaps even earlier, Scottish accents were already changing. The research and findings of the project will be made available to students and other researchers via an online resource."}

The children and their parents were surveyed between 2010 and 2012 about what they were allowed to do in their local neighbourhoods without supervision. This included: The study said: \"A large proportion of children under 11 years old in most of the countries do not have the the freedom to get about their local area. \"Even the oldest children are restricted in what they are allowed to do, at an age when many of the rights of adulthood are close to being granted, including the right to drive vehicles on the road once the test has been passed.\" Overall, Finland was found to be the top-performing country on independent mobility, with Germany coming second. According to the survey, most Finns can, without supervision: In England, most primary school children are allowed to cross roads without supervision but only 28% to travel home from school and even fewer to go out after dark, travel on local buses or walk to places other than school. Even at secondary school, less than 25% are allowed out alone after dark. Ben Shaw, director of the Policy Studies Institute, said: \"Obviously, we've got to protect children but part of their development is that we allow them to gain independence. \"People see the change from primary school to secondary school as the time to do it, but not having them do it earlier means there is a spike in road accidents at this age.\""}

And several EU foreign ministers have urged Britain to start the process soon. But Mr Hammond insisted that \"nothing is going to happen at the moment\". The timing of the formal notification of intention to leave the EU was in Britain's hands and talks would not start until a new prime minister was chosen to replace David Cameron, he said. Mr Hammond's position was supported by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff, who said Britain's politicians should take time to review the consequences of leaving the EU. \"Politicians in London should take the time to reconsider the consequences of the Brexit decision - but by that I emphatically do not mean Brexit itself,\" Peter Altmaier told Reuters news agency. Mrs Merkel said on Saturday that the EU had \"no need to be particularly nasty in any way\" in the negotiations with Britain, and that deterring other countries from leaving the bloc should not be a priority in the talks. The EU has clarified the way the UK can kick start formal negotiations to exit the bloc following Thursday's referendum. It says Britain can trigger Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets a two-year deadline for a deal, by making a formal declaration either in a letter or a speech at a meeting of the European Council, the gathering of ministers from each EU state. UK PM David Cameron has said he will step down by October to allow his successor to conduct the talks. Since Thursday's vote there has been intense speculation about when, and how, the UK might begin formal negotiations. The UK's decision to leave the EU has sent shockwaves across the continent with leaders of Eurosceptic parties in France, the Netherlands and Italy demanding referendums in their own countries. In response, some EU politicians have called for speedy reforms to quell further unrest. French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron suggested a new mission statement should be drafted and put to a referendum of all EU citizens. \"We've never had the courage to organise a true European referendum in its real sense,\" he told a conference. \"We would first build this new project with European peoples and then submit this new roadmap, this new project, to a referendum [across the bloc].\" The first summit of EU leaders with no British representation will be held on Wednesday, a day after Mr Cameron holds talks with members.

Ferguson in Missouri was rocked by riots after a grand jury decided not to charge a white police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man. Protests spread across the US and a mass walkout was held on Monday. Students and workers held a lunchtime protest in several cities to highlight the issue. \"This is not a problem just of Ferguson, Missouri. This is a national problem, Mr Obama said. \"But it's a solvable problem.\" The president spoke after a day of meetings with mayors, civil rights leaders and law enforcement officials at the White House. They discussed a programme that currently provides redundant US military tactical gear to local police departments, free of charge. Mr Obama said he has asked federal agencies for recommendations to ensure the programme is not building a \"militarised culture\" in domestic police forces. Police in Ferguson, Missouri, were criticised for being heavy-handed in dealing with protests sparked by the shooting of Michael Brown in August. The funds requested by Mr Obama would be spread over three years and some of the money will go towards purchasing 50,000 body cameras for police officers as well as resources to reform law enforcement departments. Body cameras can provide evidence of encounters between police and civilians, particularly in disputed cases such as the Ferguson shooting. The president said the stories of discrimination that young people had told him at the White House on Monday \"violate my belief about what America can do\". He also unveiled a taskforce on modern policing, to be chaired by Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey. Also on Monday, a commission tasked with making recommendations on issues stemming from the fatal shooting has convened in Ferguson. The 16-member panel, stood up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, will consider changes in areas including public interaction with law enforcement and community stability. The officer who shot Brown in Ferguson, Darren Wilson, resigned from the force over the weekend. The decision not to charge Mr Wilson days earlier triggered a nationwide debate over relations between black communities and law enforcement. The policeman said he had feared for his life. Brown's supporters said the teenager was attempting to surrender when he was shot. Some witnesses said the 18-year-old, who was unarmed, had his hands up."}

The report by Prisoner Ombudsman Tom McGonigle also found that a nurse treating the inmate was not made aware that it was an emergency situation and other prisoners were not locked in their cells during the incident. However, Mr McGonigle, said: \"While some things could have been done better, a key finding of this independent investigation is that there was no possibility to achieve an alternative outcome for Mr Brown.\" The Prisoner Ombudsman's office is required to investigate all deaths in custody in Northern Ireland, including deaths due to natural causes.

It said the medication was found at \"concentrations that lay within their respective therapeutic ranges\". \"This is important as there was speculation about a white powdery substance that was found around Mr Brown's nose at the time of his death,\" a statement from the ombudsman said. Despite criticising prison staff for their immediate reaction to finding the prisoner unconscious in his cell, the report did not find fault with the inmate's medical management during his time in the jail. A clinical reviewer who investigated the case \"did not feel that an opportunity to achieve an earlier diagnosis existed, or that there would have been a possibility to achieve an alternative outcome for Mr Brown\".

The need for improvement in these two areas had already been highlighted to the prison authorities and the South-Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, which treated the inmate. The Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) has accepted the ombudman's four recommendations and said they have already been implemented. The health trust has also accepted their recommendation, and told the ombudsman it has been reiterated to their staff and will be considered at a \"Lessons Learned\" forum.

With the skipper alongside them, the first-team squad made so merry that one of their number failed to make the midnight flight home. European rugby officials were not amused, however.

The suggestion that Saracens should be the template for others did not seem justified by the north London's club history. True, they had been denied their first Premiership title the previous season only by a dramatic late Dan Hipkiss try. But for many years Sarries had been a middling club, rarely competitive when the going got tough and rarely threatening to win anything. Eight months after the Oktoberfest jaunt, they won their first Premiership title. Three years further on and they were within two games of a Heineken Cup and Premiership double, facing Toulon and Northampton on successive Saturdays. Defeat by the French side on Saturday denied them the first of those, but success in the second remains within their grasp. Before taking up his role with Saracens, Edward Griffiths was chief executive of the South African Rugby Union. He has been credited with ensuring that the 1995 World Cup-winning Springboks side learned all the verses of the new national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, and coming up with the slogan 'one team, one country'. The 'cult of Saracens' - as some have dubbed their way of doing things - is certainly taken seriously now with Griffiths as its charismatic, unorthodox high priest.

According to the family's lawyer, one of the foetuses was suffering breathing problems. The lawyer alleges that the gynaecologist refused to abort the foetuses in order to save the mother and said: \"As long as it's alive, I will not intervene.\" No action was taken while the troubled foetus was still alive and hours later both had died, the lawyer said. Overnight, the mother's condition deteriorated and she contracted an infection. On 16 October she was transferred to intensive care, where she died. Angelo Pellicano, the head of the Cannizzaro hospital, said the lawyer was wrong. \"There was no conscientious objection on behalf of the doctor that intervened in this case because there was no voluntary termination of the pregnancy, but (the miscarriage) was forced by the grave circumstances,\" he told the Ansa news agency. \"I rule out that a doctor could have told the family what they say he told them.\" Sources told Ansa that the doctor had not been registered as a \"conscientious objector\". Catania's prosecutor has halted Milluzzo's burial while a post mortem examination is carried out. There are unconfirmed reports that some of the hospital's medical staff may be investigated. A senior doctor at the hospital, Paolo Scollo, told the Corriere website that all the doctors in his department were \"objectors\", and external doctors were called in when necessary. \"However, in this case we're talking about a spontaneous miscarriage, no external help was needed. So we do not think the doctor was negligent,\" he said. It emerged earlier this year that the proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures. Italy is a predominantly Catholic country. But in southern Italy the proportion was even higher and in Sicily it was 87.6%. Abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, provided it is during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After 12 weeks it is allowed only if the life of the mother is at risk or there is a problem with a foetus."}

At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled \"Shame of soldiers looting Westgate\". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. \"Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist,\" said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. \"DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles.\" Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles."}

It would mean more time for sport, but unions worry too many core curriculum subjects could dilute their importance. The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he wanted to look into how schools can increase levels of physical activity in children and young people. By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Although the need for more exercise is clear enough, it isn't just a simple matter of adding PE as a core subject. Pupils in Wales already have as core subjects Welsh, English, maths and sciences. They are the areas the government has decided should have most time and resources allocated to them. And teaching unions fear the more you add to that core, the less of a priority they each become. More than one-third are either overweight or obese, costing the Welsh NHS more than \u00a370m a year. The current core subjects in schools in Wales are English, Welsh (as a first language), mathematics, and science, while physical education is a foundation subject. Having PE elevated to a core part of the curriculum would mean more time devoted to it, as well as extra resources and more training for teachers. Schools would also need to give greater priority to provision for PE. As a result: \u2022 Teachers would be required to be competent to deliver the subject on completion of their initial teacher training. \u2022 Well qualified, specialist teachers would be needed to work with schools to ensure high-quality provision. \u2022 Standards and provision in physical education would be rigorously reviewed in school, both by the educational consortia and by schools inspectorate Estyn. \u2022 Progress would be regularly measured. The move to give PE more status in schools would be a bold move but an important one, according to the group. In its report, the group, which also included the chair of Sports Wales Laura McAllister, said: \"Given the Welsh government's commitment to making physical literacy as important a development skill as reading and writing, the group felt that changing the status of physical education is the only credible and secure way of ensuring this.\" But while teaching unions support the idea, they are worried that too many subjects on the core curriculum could dilute their importance. Dr Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, said it was important to decide on \"what small core we want\". \"We certainly want literacy and numeracy in there,\" he said. \"We may well want physical education in there too, that's for the government to decide."}

Currently, police forces in England and Wales decide whether to pass a case on to the CPS after investigating a death. The CPS said cases should be referred to a prosecutor as early as possible. Department of Transport figures show 113 cyclists were killed in the UK last year. Last year a Freedom of Information request by BBC's Newsbeat found that between 2007 and 2014 there were 276 recorded incidents where a cyclist was killed in an accident involving a motor vehicle. Of these, 148 - 54% - resulted in the driver of the vehicle being charged with an offence. Of those found guilty, fewer than half went to prison. Sir Keir, now a Labour MP, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that if a death was involved and it was serious enough to have had a criminal investigation \"then it really ought to go off to the CPS for the final decision\". In Scotland, if evidence suggests the driver is to blame for a collision that leads to a cyclist's death, a report is to be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal. But data compiled from a 2014 freedom of information request to Police Scotland suggests this happened in only a small number of cases. Cycling campaigners are calling for a change in liability - who is considered responsible for a collision - in civil cases. At the moment there is no presumption on either side. Last year, my dad Mick was killed as he cycled through central London. After three weeks in a coma, he died. At the inquest the driver said the first she realised was when she heard a noise, like something falling from the sky. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death. We had questions about how the police were investigating from very early on. Potential witnesses weren't chased as we would have liked and we felt they just didn't think about what we were going through. A year on from my dad's death we held a vigil at the spot where his crash happened. That day, the police told a journalist they would pass the case to prosecutors - which could lead to a trial. It felt like progress. But this changed just four days later when police again went straight to the journalist, saying the case was actually closed. I still want to know more about what happened on the night of my dad's crash and the only option for my family is a private prosecution."}

The people behind it at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been working on it for a few years and have just published 18 pages of exactly how it works. Arnau Raventos is the lead professor on the project. He tells Newsbeat they have \"been working with the local television companies in Spain in order to try to make the job easier for the person who manually does the summaries currently.\" Without having to read the full report (we did that for you) - in short - it analyses what are known as key-frames. So, every part of the match is looked over by the computer to spot tell-tale signs of when something interesting is happening. That might be lots of players grouped together, lots of zoomed-in action, extra noise from the crowd or the sound of the referee's whistle. Arnau calls them \"occasions\". \"We want to find specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal is an occasion.\" We thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that. There is a long way to go though. The technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in.

The \u00c2\u00a31.1bn M4 proposal would cross four SSSIs along the Gwent Levels. Welsh Government lawyers argued environmental concerns had to be balanced against other interests. The inquiry in Newport heard the scheme would mean about 105 hectares of designated land, set aside for the protection of water invertebrates, would have to be lost. The Gwent Levels' unique network of ditches, known as reens, were dug during Roman times and have since become a habitat for a range of rare species. The Welsh Government has pledged to replace lost reens with new ones. Dr Jessica Poole, of conservation body Natural Resources Wales (NRW), told the inquiry discussions between the regulator and the Welsh Government meant she was content with the proposed design of the new reens. But she said there was no guarantee they would work, and it could be some time before they supported the aquatic insects the sites are meant to conserve. Replicating a complex ecology that has developed over centuries would be \"challenging\", she said. NRW said the Welsh Government had not demonstrated the project would comply with its statutory duty to promote sustainable development. Should the alternative blue route, suggested by transport expert Prof Stuart Cole, be adopted - the motorway's impact on SSSI land would be \"significantly reduced\", Dr Poole said. But the inquiry heard several issues NRW had raised in letters responding to the project's draft plans had been addressed and it was now satisfied on matters including water quality, drainage and some protected species such as otters and bats. Morag Ellis QC, acting on behalf of the Welsh Government, said it was for Welsh ministers to balance any potential impact on SSSI land with other public interests related to the new motorway. Claiming adverse effects were \"fully mitigated for\" was to apply a standard not in accordance with the law, she said. She described the changes NRW had made to its initial objections after extensive discussions with Welsh Government as \"a major step forward\"."}

But Mr Gove said Turkey had seen an \"erosion of fundamental democratic freedoms\" and the EU should be protesting, not offering \"concessions\". David Cameron has said it would be \"literally decades\" before Turkey was ready to join the EU. And he has said the UK has a veto over it happening, saying the agreement of every other EU member - as well as 28 national Parliaments - was necessary before a new country could join. But Mr Gove said it was \"official British government policy\" for Turkey to become a member of the bloc and \"not to have a referendum on new countries joining\". The EU referendum on 23 June was the \"only chance\" for the UK to have its say on free movement from Turkey, he added. The issue of Turkey's bid to join the EU - and the proposed deal to grant Turks visa-free travel in return for Turkey taking back migrants who have crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece - sparked a row earlier on in the EU referendum campaign. In a speech at Vote Leave's headquarters on Wednesday, Mr Gove, one of the leading Out campaigners, returned to the issue, warning about what he said were the security implications of expanding the EU to Turkey. He said: \"With the terrorism threat that we face only growing, it is hard to see how it could possibly be in our security interests to open visa-free travel to 77 million Turkish citizens and to create a border-free zone from Iraq, Iran and Syria to the English Channel. \"It is even harder to see how such a course is wise when extremists everywhere will believe that the West is opening its borders to appease an Islamist government.\" Mr Gove said Turkey's \"democratic development\" had gone into \"reverse\" under President Erdogan. He added: \"We and the European Union should be protesting in the clearest and loudest possible manner at this erosion of fundamental democratic freedoms. \"But instead we and the European Union are making concession after concession to Erdogan.\" The prime minister has previously accused Leave campaigners of making \"a very misleading claim about Turkey\" and the EU. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Speaking last month, Mr Cameron said: \"It would be decades, literally decades, before this had a prospect of happening and even at that stage we'd still be able to say no.\" And he added: \"The fact that the Leave campaign are getting things as straightforward as this wrong, I think should call into question their whole judgement into making the bigger argument about leaving the EU."}

Mr Odinga said the poll was rigged to give President Uhuru Kenyatta victory, and called for a \"day of mourning for the fallen patriots\". However, Kenyans on Twitter have been using the hashtag #TurudiKaziniChallenge (Swahili for \"Let's return to work\" ) to urge a return to normalcy following last week's disruptions. Mr Kenyatta repeated his appeal for peace. \"At the end of the day we are all Kenyans, we don't need to fight one another, we don't need to destroy each other's property, we don't need to take life,\" he said in a statement. \"Kenyans have said that the election is behind them, the majority have returned to work,\" he added. Young people have been burning tyres in Kibera, a Nairobi slum where Mr Odinga has strong support, reports the BBC's Tomi Oladipo from the scene. However, some of Mr Odinga's supporters in Kibera have opened their shops, saying that while they agree with him that the result was rigged, they cannot afford to lose business, our reporter adds. Businesses are open as usual in the coastal city of Mombasa. In the western city of Kisumu, a stronghold of Mr Odinga, there has been a mixed response to the strike, with shops open in some areas and shut in others. The official results gave President Kenyatta about 54% of the vote, and Mr Odinga 45%. \"This is a failed regime that is resorting to killing people instead of addressing the real issue. The vote was stolen. There's no secret about that,\" Mr Odinga told his supporters on Sunday, as he called for a strike. Foreign observers have declared the poll free and fair. European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan are among those who have urged Mr Odinga to seek redress through the courts - something the opposition coalition says is not an option."}

The Stirling University academics behind the report called for a \"retail revolution\" to help people choose healthier options. However, the study was criticised by the Scottish Grocers' Federation. It said the report failed to take account of the efforts already being made to promote healthy eating. Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said Scottish obesity levels, currently 30%, were projected to rise to 40% by 2030. Professor Leigh Sparks, who wrote the report, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was an imbalance in the type of food promoted in shops. \"If you look at the environment in store in retailing, then most of the promotions are pushing the products that are less healthy for consumers,\" he said. \"A lot of the products have been supersized as well - boxes of crisps, bags of crisps are good examples of that.\" He said that manufacturers needed to make changes to the composition of their products, while retailers should provide more information for consumers and change their \"balance of promotions\". \"I think retailers are increasingly aware of the issue and they're looking at what they can do,\" he added. \"But most of the voluntary schemes that have gone on so far have not had the impact because of this overwhelming tide in terms of unhealthy promotions as well.\" The report also backs the idea of a sugar tax. FSS senior dietary adviser Dr Gillian Purdon said: \"The report supports Food Standards Scotland views and recommendations for the need to extend sugar tax beyond soft drinks, to reformulate products to reduce sugar fat and salt, to resize portions, address less healthy food promotion and to provide clearer consumer information on products in both the retail and out of home sectors. \"This report will help us to develop new approaches to improve the balance of food offered and promoted by the retail sector. \"It is clear that a combination of measures will be needed overall to enable healthier eating. Regulation of promotions of high fat, salt and/or sugar food and drink within retail stores and out of home premises should be taken forward as a priority.\" Previous research by FSS indicated about 50% of less healthy food choices are purchased on promotions. For healthier foods, the figure is about 30%. The report added: \"We conclude that the current context for consumer choice in-store is affecting the health and diet of consumers in Scotland. \"Voluntary and self-regulatory approaches or relying on consumers to make 'good' decisions are not having sufficient impact."}

At least officially, he is not a citizen of the country he calls home. He was born and raised in Nepal and plays for the national team. He has an Indian father and a Nepali mother, so getting citizenship should not be a problem according to the law of the land. But his efforts to acquire Nepalese citizenship so far have been futile. \"It's been almost eight to nine years that I've been trying to get my citizenship. I'm still facing problems. It's really frustrating at times,\" he says. A few years ago, he was given a travel document as a special concession so he could play in matches abroad. Bridging India's identity divide A life without identity Identity in pictures A game changer? Pakistan's identity management In Nepal, you can usually apply for citizenship at the age of 16 as long as your father or mother is able to sign the official document, according to the Nepali Citizenship Act of 2006. But in practice, women in this patriarchal society still face a lot of discrimination when passing down citizenship to their children, specially in the absence of the father or if the father is not a Nepali citizen. A lack of citizenship document can make your life tough - you cannot get a driving licence, open a bank account, pursue higher education or carry out legal transactions. And according to the United Nations, the number of people grappling with this problem is far from small. \"We estimate from the numbers we've seen that this is quite a big problem,\" says Robert Piper, the UN Resident Humanitarian Co-ordinator. \"In the Election Commission's findings, more than 2 million people they interviewed - people just from the villages, not the urban areas - were actually unable to show their citizenship documents,\" adds Mr Piper. Usha Kala Rai, a member of the now dissolved Constituent Assembly, believes that Nepal's bureaucratic system discriminates against women. \"Many women are victims of violence and discrimination. Specially those who have gone abroad for work, victims of rape, women who were abandoned, those forced to leave home and divorcees - all risk being deprived of their identity,\" she says. Bhagwati Chettri, 55, a Nepali, was abandoned by her husband several years ago. She does not have her own citizenship document because she failed to acquire one from either her parents or her husband before he left her. This means that her two children, who are just coming of age, have no legal identity either. \"I have been trying for the last eight years to get a citizenship certificate."}

New legislation passed this year places a statutory duty on schools and colleges to counter radicalisation. The seminars will be led by Kamal Hanif, head of Birmingham's Waverley School and an expert on Islam and citizenship. The union says the aim is to offer support and guidance to senior school leaders in the wake of high-profile cases such as that of the three London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in February and are believed to be in the city of Raqqa, a stronghold of Islamic State. Their families later complained that police, the school and the local authority had failed to pass on information they said could have prevented the girls leaving. The Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015 requires educational establishments to prevent young people being drawn into terrorism. The seminars, in June and July, will help school and college leaders understand these duties and give them practical help and advice. The aim is to maintain an atmosphere of equality and diversity in schools but also to help teachers understand how social media can be used \"to groom young people into extremist ideologies\", says the union. \"This is about having a greater understanding around the issues of radicalisation and extremism,\" said Mr Hanif. He said the seminars would help head teachers \"identify situations\" and \"deal with them in an appropriate manner, without overreacting and being alarmist. \"Young people spend a lot of their time on the web and social media and they can easily get drawn into extremist ideas without access to a counter-narrative. \"These seminars will help schools and, in turn, parents, who often have no idea that their children are accessing this sort of information, to pick up the signs, and use the appropriate channels in dealing with these concerns. \"They will help to equip heads with the counter-narratives to some of the false claims put out by extremists.\" Mr Hanif will be joined by the counter-extremism campaigner Sara Khan, co-founder of the counter-extremism and women's rights organisation Inspire and by ASCL's parliamentary specialist Anna Cole. Ms Khan said the seminars would clarify what schools were expected to do. \"Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of myth propagated about what the statutory requirements mean for both schools and pupils.\" Ms Cole said the aim was to avoid criminalising young people by helping schools intervene \"in the right way at an early stage\". \"The key thing is to put in place proper risk assessments and have an open culture where different views and ideas can be discussed in an open way."}

Under the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from \u00a362.70 to \u00a373.10 a week. Ministers say they will spend an extra \u00a32bn on social care over three years. Carer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week. Eligible carers cannot earn more than \u00a3116 a week after tax. Mr Corbyn said he believed it \"would be a good thing to do\" to help carers, \"usually women\" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home. \"Caring for people is stressful,\" he told the BBC. \"In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.\" In his speech later, the Labour leader will claim \"Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting \u00a34.6bn from council care budgets\". \"Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,\" he will say. \"The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers \u00a3132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support. \"That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of \u00a310 a week. \"We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain. \"This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.\" According to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost \u00a3538m by 2020/21. This would be covered by scrapping the expected \u00a3650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth \u00a31m free of death duties. But the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance. Luke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \"Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do. \"That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional \u00a3450 a year for carers since 2010."}

Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks. Though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts, it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack. Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively. Prof Pilar Ruiz-Lozano at Stanford University (which has patented the patch), said: \"Many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation. \"The hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage.\" Commenting on the study in Nature, Prof Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at Columbia University, said the work \"could lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction\".

That poses a potential issue for Facebook at a time when it is trying to convince parts of the industry to host articles on its platform, provide it with exclusive video content and allow the tech firm to sell advertising on their behalf. \"Peter did what he did on his own, not as a Facebook board member,\" Ms Sandberg told attendees at the California event. \"We have very independent board members with very independent thoughts that they share publicly. Those strong people make really good board members because they have strong views and they're not afraid to think differently than other people, which has served Facebook well.\" But one expert questioned whether the decision to keep on Mr Thiel - who was one of Facebook's early investors - was sustainable in the long-term. \"Facebook has always fundamentally seen itself as a technology company, but is now having to deal with the public position - and also the ethics and responsibilities - of being a publisher,\" media consultant Steve Hewlett told the BBC. \"Imagine that this person were sitting on the board of The Times or the BBC - that would look like an obvious conflict of interest. You can't have a billionaire sitting on a publisher's board who is suing other people for publishing things. \"So, if you think of Facebook as being a publisher, this is plainly problematic.\" The clash between Gawker and Mr Thiel dates back to 2007, when the media firm published an article headlined: \"Peter Thiel is totally gay people\". Last week, the venture capitalist revealed to the New York Times that he had subsequently funded a team of lawyers to find and help \"victims\" of other Gawker articles sue the firm - an act he described as \"philanthropic\". One case resulted in a jury ordering Gawker to pay Hulk Hogan $140m (\u00c2\u00a397m) after it decided the publication of a sex tape featuring the ex-professional wrestler amounted to an invasion of privacy. Gawker is appealing against the ruling, which threatens its future. The publisher has also challenged Mr Thiel's involvement and questioned his continued role at the social network. \"As a Facebook board member, how have your own views on politics and news influenced your contribution to corporate decisions?\" asked Gawker's founder Nick Denton in an open letter."}

There was also no deal granting India overland access across Bangladesh to its land-locked north-eastern states. But there was good news for tens of thousands of \"stateless border people\". The two countries agreed \"to put in motion\" a deal that allows about 50 Bangladeshi enclaves inside India to be integrated within Bangladesh and about 100 Indian areas inside Bangladesh to become part of India. Officials say that under the terms of a protocol between the two leaders - the details of which will be worked out at a later date - residents of these areas will have the right to decide whether they want to become Indians or Bangladeshis. BBC Bengali editor Sabir Mustafa says that the failure to reach agreement over sharing water from the Teesta river is a big setback for Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, who has staked much of her personal reputation on securing a deal. By Sabir Mustafa BBC Bengali editor There is little doubt that relations between the two countries are at their closest since the early 1970s when India helped Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan. But the warmth in relations is also serving to mask a growing unease in both countries about the nature of the relationship. There are worries that the Indian leadership may have invested all its goodwill in one political party in Bangladesh, namely the Awami League led by current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. As a result, whenever the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP comes to power, relations could take a nose dive. There is also concern in Bangladesh that Sheikh Hasina appears too eager to accommodate Indian demands. The visit lost much of its lustre when the Indian side made it clear at the last minute there would not be any agreement on the sharing of a major river. It has also taken some of the gloss off the first visit to Bangladesh by an Indian prime minister for 12 years. All the two sides could agree on this issue was a commitment to revisit it at a later date. Prime Minister Singh told reporters after the talks that \"substantial progress has been made on sharing water of common rivers\". He said further discussion was needed. It is widely thought that the deal fell through because of last-minute objections to it from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was reported to believe that India was in danger of supplying too much water to Bangladesh."}

Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life. Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home. It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth. Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\" The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth. Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own. Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's. The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet. The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars. Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star. This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met. Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet. Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date. \"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue."}

James Nicol believes he was exposed to asbestos while working on council houses in the 1980s. He wants Highland Council to acknowledge that he was exposed. The local authority said it could not comment on Mr Nicol's case, adding that any claims would be handled by solicitors. The 85-year-old worked for Highland Regional Council, now Highland Council, as a labourer. He believes that he came into contact with asbestos while refurbishing council properties in Inverness. Mr Nicol also later worked for the regional council as a school janitor. In March this year, the pensioner was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an incurable lung cancer almost always caused by asbestos exposure. He said he had first noticed a change in his health during a swimming session. \"I could swim, but not the same speed and that was why I went to my doctor,\" Mr Nicol told BBC Scotland. \"I went to my GP and from then on it was x-rays, scans and a biopsy in Aberdeen.\" Mr Nicol was given his diagnosis at his local hospital, Raigmore in Inverness. He said: \"The consultant told me it was 'all bad, no cure Mr Nicol'.\" While still in receipt of a local authority pension, he claims Highland Council has turned its back on him by failing to reply to correspondence from his solicitor on his condition. A Highland Council spokesman said: \"We cannot comment on this matter. \"However, we can confirm that where individuals appoint solicitors to make claims against Highland Council, communications would be made via the person's solicitor and not direct with the claimant.\" The charity Clydeside Action on Asbestos was set up in 1984 and initially dealt with shipyard workers. However, senior welfare rights officer and director Phyllis Craig said the charity was now increasingly seeing people from other areas of employment, and also more women. She said: \"We are seeing a lot of people from the construction industry and we are seeing teachers, nurses, doctors, policemen and firemen. \"Many of them had been exposed 20 years ago. Ms Craig added: \"There is a myth that women were only exposed to asbestos if they washed their husband's overalls.\" She said women were just as prone to the risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres working in a building, such as a hospital or school, as their male colleagues were. Law changes in Scotland give sufferers and their families north of the border more rights than anywhere else in the UK. Some sufferers, such as former textile factory worker Annie McGhee from Motherwell, may be eligible for a one-off payment from the government."}

Lewes Crown Court heard that rather than having Asperger's syndrome he had an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that was undiagnosed for years. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Roderick Ley made the assessment after the stabbing. Mr Lock, a retired solicitor, was stabbed after crashing at about 16mph into the back of Mr Daley's car on the A24 in West Sussex on 16 July. He was forced to brake suddenly after Mr Daley made an emergency stop. The great-grandfather, who had recently been given the all-clear from prostate cancer, died at the scene. The trial has heard how Mr Daley, formerly of St Elmo Road, Worthing, had been suffering from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had \"pleaded\" with experts to section him. On Monday, Dr Ley told jurors: \"It's clear that the diagnosis of Asperger's was wrong. \"He has an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that was undiagnosed for many, many years.\" He said Mr Daley was not psychotic every moment of every day, and he would often \"downplay\" his symptoms. However, Dr Ley agreed that he exhibited \"narcissistic\", \"histrionic\" and \"self-centred\" traits, adding that it was unlikely he would ever have complete resolution of his illness. Another expert, consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph, said he was satisfied on all the evidence he had seen that Mr Daley was not psychotic at the time of the killing. Jurors also head from Mr Daley's father, who said his son had never been a violent person. John Daley described him as a \"nice guy\" who was affectionate to his family and animals. He said Mr Daley was \"scrupulously honest in all his dealings with others, honest to a fault in that he finds it difficult to lie about things\". He told the court that he first became worried about his son's mental health when he reported hearing voices. Mr Daley said he started a journal, partly to keep track of his son's treatment. \"The second reason for having the document was, as time went on, it was clear that Matthew's life expectations were draining away and I didn't want to be in my 80s and look back saying, 'What did I do'?\" The trial continues."}

A 69-year-old man was arrested in Dartford, Kent, on Sunday after detectives from the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch conducted a joint search with local police.

There was a 15% drop in the number of enrolments at FE colleges over the same period, as some students can be enrolled on more than one course. According to the department, there were 180,825 enrolments at FE colleges in 2013/14, but by 2015/16 that figure had fallen to 153,817. One of the six FE colleges, Belfast Metropolitan College (BMC), had a particularly steep decline in its enrolment in just one year. The number of enrolments at BMC alone fell from 36,685 in 2014/15 to 28,514 in 2015/16 - a decline of 22.3%. When approached to explain why this was the case, they declined to comment. NUS-USI President Fergal McFerran expressed alarm at the \"staggering drop\" and called on the executive to make a \"significant increase in the funding allocation for tertiary education and student financial support in the new budget\". The college with the lowest rate of decline was South Eastern Regional College where enrolments fell by 8.3% - from 35,832 in 2013/14 to 32,858 in 2015/16. FE colleges provide a range of courses for a range of learners including: Sources working in the FE sector told the BBC that the decline in enrolments could be down to a range of factors, including budget constraints leading to cuts to courses and staff. In 2015/16 over 400 staff in the FE sector were offered voluntary redundancy. Some also said that leisure, recreational and hobby courses - or non-regulated courses - had been reduced in recent years, leading to a drop in enrolments from life-long learners. The DfE figures indicate that there has been a consequent drop in the number of enrolments to non-regulated courses over the three years. In 2013/14 there were around 39,000 enrolments to recreational courses compared to around 24,500 in 2015/16. This was a result of DfE's 'Further Education Means Business' strategy, which aimed to reduce the number of recreational courses to encourage more \"economically focused provision\". The chief executive of Colleges NI, Gerry Campbell, said that further education was vital for the future of Northern Ireland's economy. \"While there has been a decline in relation to residential and leisure type courses, in many ways over the past two or three years there has been an increasing focus from the colleges and FE sector as a whole to engage more on the provision of economically relevant courses,\" he said.

But there is certainly a view that the currency would decline if Britain were to decide to leave. Some analysts expect the fall in the value of sterling in the event of a Brexit vote would be very sharp . The concern reflects the view held by many - though by no means all - economists that leaving the EU would undermine the UK's economic performance. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU. There would be a period of uncertainty about access to the EU market for British exporters while new arrangements were negotiated. The ultimate result could be that it would be harder to sell to the EU market. It is argued that foreign investment could be hit by the uncertainty. This would be going on at a time when the UK has a large deficit in what is called \"the current account deficit\" - which is trade in goods and services plus some international financial transactions. The deficit has to be financed by loans and foreign investment in financial assets. Unease about the economic outlook could mean that foreign investors would only provide the finance for the deficit if sterling were cheaper. There is of course another view, reflected by Economists for Brexit that the UK would prosper outside the EU. For the short term however, it is more likely to be the majority view that moves markets and sterling in particular. Our reporting on the currency markets usually focuses on what's called the spot rates, the exchange rate that an investor pays to buy currency immediately. But they can also buy options, which are rights to buy or sell a currency (or other types of financial asset) in the future at a price fixed in advance. It's a way of getting insurance against a move in the exchange rate. If the move you are worried about doesn't happen you don't exercise the option. So you are insured, but you have had to pay for it. That part of the market suggests that investors do think a leave vote would weaken sterling."}

On Monday 29 September, a fellow passenger noted him walking in \"a curious, a sinister manner\" at Waverley Station, \"clearly making an effort to get very close to a female ahead of him\" on the escalator. Fiscal depute Aidan Higgins, prosecuting, told the court that \"it was clear he was using his phone to get under the lady's skirt, taking photographs\". The commuter reported his concerns to British Transport Police and Trotter was identified from CCTV footage. He was detained as he left the station the following day. Examination of Trotter's phone and his home computer established that he had been using his mobile on various days between 11 June and 29 September, with 22 videos showing the camera had been directed under women's skirts. Defence solicitor Neil Hay told the court Trotter was \"most ashamed of his actions\", and \"well aware his behaviour is unacceptable\". He said his client had \"lost his career, brought his family to the brink of financial ruin and brought shame and humiliation to himself and those very close to him\". Sentencing him to 18 months in prison, Sheriff Peter Braid told Trotter: \"You have pled guilty to taking images of women in a clandestine manner, prompted by voyeuristic impulses for your own sexual gratification. \"This involved significant planning committed over a period of more than three months in public places where women should be able to walk without fear. \"The repugnance society must feel towards these offences is such that, in my view, there is no alternative to a custodial sentence, in retribution and to deter others.\""}

He was second fastest in the individual pursuit and seventh in the elimination race with three more events on Monday. Becky James broke the women's sprint Olympic record in qualification and is in Monday's quarter-finals along with fellow Briton Katy Marchant. Cavendish, 31, began his campaign with a hard-fought sixth-placed finish in the scratch race, after Denmark's Lasse Norman Hansen, the London 2012 Olympic champion and Roger Kluge took the top two spots by gaining a lap on the field. In the individual pursuit, Cavendish recorded a time of four minutes 16.878 seconds and caught reigning world champion Colombian Fernando Gaviria Rendon in the process. That temporarily gave the Manxman the outright lead, before Hansen set a new Olympic record of 4:14:982, beating Sir Bradley Wiggins' time set in 2008, to win his second event in a row. However, Hansen dropped from first to sixth overall after he was the first rider to fall out of the elimination race which sees the rider in last position at the end of every second lap ejected from the race. Cavendish was looking comfortable as other riders dropped out but he was ejected, despite not being the last rider over the line, when he overtook a rider while off the inside of the track, and was awarded seventh place. France's Thomas Boudat, the 2014 world champion, leads on 106 points, two more than Italy's Elia Viviani who won the elimination race, with Cavendish third on 96 points. The fourth event - the time trial - starts at 14:21 BST on Monday, before the flying lap and points race events. Wales' James won a silver medal in the keirin on Saturday and maintained her good form on Sunday as she set a new Olympic record during the sprint qualification. James recorded a time of 10.721 seconds to beat the 10.724 set by fellow Briton Victoria Pendleton at the 2012 Olympics in London. That saw James become the fastest qualifier and she comfortably beat Olga Ismayilova of Azerbaijan by a margin of 0.165 secs to move into the quarter-finals, which take place from 14:00 BST on Monday. Marchant also advanced in style as she defeated Canada's Monique Sullivan after posting the second fastest qualification time.

The fact is the campaign has become a succession of tightly controlled photo opportunities... by all the main parties. This has become the hi-vis, hard hat election. It's been the predictable campaign gear for both David Cameron and George Osborne. No walkabouts. No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters. But there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support. Election hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election. Magazine Monitor: Where did the word 'hustings' come from? There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity. I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal. Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans. They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the \"noise\" of national campaigning. That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities. On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South. There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools. But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university? The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years. It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students. One angry voice in the audience shouted: \"That's outrageous and disgraceful\". It got backing from the Greens. \"That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market,\" said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley. There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff. A precise solution perhaps required a precise response. But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one. \"It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party,\" she told the questioner. And Labour's Dame Margaret? \"We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating."}

His experience tallies with that of French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, who described being backed up against the metal door, and getting no response to passengers' desperate calls for help. The drama unfolded on board a high-speed train travelling from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday. Mr Robinson realised something was wrong shortly after the Thalys train went through Brussels. He saw three members of the train's staff run through his coach, carriage 11, which was the next compartment along from carriage 12, where the gunman emerged. \"They said nothing. They were a man followed by two women,\" he says. \"They looked scared, they didn't alert us to anything, they ran to the end of my carriage and used their key to open a service door. Then they locked the door after them.\" Carriage 11 was in the front half of the train and the locked door allowed staff access to a service area, which was off limits to passengers. Then other people started running through from carriage 12. Some were covered in blood, others said they had seen a man with a gun shooting people. \"There we were, with nowhere to go. There were probably 20 to 30 of of us, including the French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade and his family. We didn't know anything.\" Anglade, who injured his hand as he tried to activate the train's alarm, has also spoken about members of train staff locking themselves in a private cabin, complaining that they could have led passengers to a luggage area in another part of the train. He told Paris Match (in French) \"We shouted for the staff to let us in, we yelled 'open!' There was no response.\" Agnes Ogier, the boss of Thalys, has said there will be an internal investigation and the staff involved will be asked to \"explain their behaviour during this dramatic event\". Jamie Robinson says after 10 terrifying minutes a man entered their carriage and explained there had been a man with a gun but the situation was now under control. Afterwards he learned this was Anthony Sadler, one of the American passengers who helped overpower the attacker. \"The relief just exploded. We were all in such painful shock,\" he recalls. After learning they were safe Jamie Robinson and other passengers in his coach remained where they were, in numb silence, until they reached Arras station where the suspect, Ayoub El-Khazzani, a 25-year-old Moroccan, was arrested."}

It has been reported that he missed a key vote in parliament when he was in Switzerland taking part in World Cup referee training. Mr Macpherson said: \"The arrogance and blatant disrespect of 'three jobs' Tory Douglas Ross is simply staggering. \"Last time the whistle was blown on one of his refereeing junkets the Tories claimed it was just a 'one off'.

Some of Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric cast doubt over long-standing US alliances, including with Japan. The meeting was Mr Trump's first face-to-face with a world leader since winning the presidential election. The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy. The president-elect has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr Abe strenuously supports as a means of countering China's growing economic strength. The deal was approved by the Japanese parliament, despite the likelihood that it would be cancelled when Mr Trump takes office. Mr Trump has also said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil, and has floated the idea that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korean missiles. The meeting was reportedly arranged when Mr Abe rang the president-elect to congratulate him, mentioning that he would be passing through New York on the way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Abe said: \"We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time. We held it in a very warm atmosphere. \"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations the alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence.\" The Japanese leader gave few details of the meeting but added the two agreed to meet again for deeper talks on a wider range of issues. Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who have emerged as key advisers to Mr Trump since his surprise election victory, also met Mr Abe at Trump Tower. Media speculation over her role has included the possibility of her becoming ambassador to Japan. In the days since the election, Mr Trump has been speaking to dozens of world leaders as well as possible cabinet appointees from his home and office inside the Manhattan skyscraper. In other developments: Elsewhere, vice president-elect and Trump transition lead Mike Pence has said he is confident Donald Trump's administration can work with Democrats. Emerging from meetings with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Mr Pence said he looks \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward\".

Climbers need to cross the glacier, including the treacherous Khumbu Icefall, to climb the mighty peak. The accelerated meltdown of glaciers in the region is causing concern against a backdrop of rising global temperatures. Scientists say the warning is the first of its kind for Khumbu, although other glaciers in the Himalayas have seen an increase in the number of lakes formed. Such newly formed glacial lakes can overflow causing flooding, and with it loss of life and damage downstream. This is the first scientific team to visit the region after the devastating earthquake last April. \"A decade or so ago, there were individual ponds on the Khumbu glacier but in the past five years or so they have begun to get larger and join up,\" said Ann Rowan, who led the field study team from the universities of Sheffield and Leeds. Dr Rowan's team has been studying the behaviour of debris-covered glaciers, focusing on Khumbu. \"Particularly, on the left hand side of the lower reaches of the glacier, there is a series of about seven or eight large ponds that are now starting to link and form a big chain,\" she told the BBC. \"There is water flowing from the upper part of the glacier through the series of these ponds and that is going to encourage them to join up. \"At present, the glacier appears to be disintegrating, and may form a few large and potentially hazardous lakes on the glacier surface.\" Dr Rowan's team has studied satellite images of the Khumbu glacier dating back 15 years and has also conducted three ground surveys since 2009. The scientists found that parts of the lower region of the debris-covered glacier have been shrinking because of loss of ice underneath. This has allowed the formation and expansion of water bodies. The study says measurements for the past 15 years show that the surface of the debris-covered glacier has been declining at the rate of two metres per year. Unlike the usually smooth-iced glaciers elsewhere, many in the Himalayan region are debris covered, meaning they are coated by a layer of sand, gravel and rock. Scientists say since the upper parts of many Himalayan glaciers are losing ice mass due to rising temperatures. The supply of ice to the lower part of the glacier is therefore decreasing, causing the shrinkage."}

The witness, who cannot be named due to the nature of the allegations, told jurors said she was first abused after she and a friend were taken out for a meal by Mr Hussain and a number of other Asian males. She said: \"I felt very grown up. They took us out and paid for the meal.

But transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were \"energised and excited about their new role serving the country\" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media. \"First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world,\" wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. \"Melania Trump's decision is appalling.\" Others joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage. However, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence. But Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters. \"Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,\" one Twitter user noted. However, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers. But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before? William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season. The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as \"Oak View\" but it was more commonly known as \"Red Top\" because of its red roof. But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House. \"The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,\" Mr Seale said. \"It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising.\" Mr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House."}

Immigration minister James Brokenshire said he hoped the DFT system would resume within weeks. It is thought about 800 applicants are affected - and can now seek bail. Of those, it is estimated that about 100 may have to be released. The system, introduced in 2000, accelerates legal hearings and appeals while keeping the individual detained. It is used in cases which officials believe can be decided quickly. Last month the Court of Appeal ordered the Home Office to halt the system immediately after an earlier High Court hearing concluded it contained \"structural unfairness\". High Court judge Mr Justice Nicol put a \"legal stay\" - a temporary delay - on his ruling on 12 June, following a case brought by campaign group Detention Action. This meant the fast-track system remained in operation until the government had exhausted all opportunities to appeal. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said officials were worried their procedures were not as robust as they should be. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the system had \"come under significant legal challenge\". \"Risks surrounding the safeguards within the system for particularly vulnerable applicants have also been identified to the extent that we cannot be certain of the level of risk of unfairness to certain vulnerable applicants who may enter DFT. \"In light of these issues, I have decided to temporarily suspend the operation of the detained fast-track policy. \"I hope this pause to be short in duration, perhaps only a matter of weeks, but I will only resume operation of this policy when I am sure the right structures are in place to minimise any risk of unfairness.\" The decision to suspend the process means those asylum seekers detained and awaiting hearings will be reassessed at a \"senior level\" to see if they can be released from detention to continue their asylum application in the normal way. Mr Brokenshire added: \"Those who meet the general criteria for detention will not be directly affected by the decision to suspend DFT. \"Many are already detained under these powers, for example because they are at risk of absconding and face imminent removal. \"Only if detention can no longer be justified outside a DFT process will applicants be released to continue their asylum claim in the regular asylum system.\" He said applicants who face removal to a safe third country, pose a risk to the public or are foreign offenders are \"still liable to be detained or remain detained\". The DFT system accelerated some 4,300 asylum applications or decisions in 2013."}

The captain's desire and work rate are never in question but he was loose in possession too often. Back from his short-lived international retirement but for how long? The Celtic captain gave the midfield energy and aggression as expected. Largely ineffectual. Didn't get on the ball enough to make a positive impact. Again, a surprise inclusion given his lack of game time at West Brom. Missed a glorious opportunity to level the game early in the second half, dragging a shot wide from near the penalty spot. Another player guilty of giving the ball away too often. Provided some threatening set-pieces. Really should have scored not long after Forrest's miss when he had a good sight at goal. Led the line well with positive energy in the first half. However, made a poor decision not to play in Snodgrass on a good counter-attack. Tired in the second half as Scotland meekly surrendered.

Mrs Papini was discovered with a bag over her head and chained at the waist and wrists on the side of a highway, about 140 miles (225km) from her home in northern California before dawn last Thursday. She was abducted while jogging near her home in Redding, California, on 2 November. Sheriff Bosenko said of the unspecified message branded on her skin: \"I would think that that was some sort of either an exertion of power and control and/or maybe some type of message that the brand contained.\" He also said her blonde hair had been cut off, speculating the attacker was \"a very sick person who may have wanted not only to cut it off to change her physical appearance, but also as to humiliate them, wear her down\". Mr Papini told ABC News his wife was \"was covered in bruises ranging from yellow to black\". \"My Sherri suffered tremendously and all the visions swirling in your heads of her appearance, I assure you, are not as graphic and gruesome as the reality.\" Her nose had been broken and \"her now emaciated body of 87lb (39kg) was covered in multicolored bruises, severe burns, red rashes and chain markings,\" he added. Police have cleared Mr Papini of suspicion after he submitted to a polygraph test. In his written statement, Mrs Papini's husband added: \"Rumors, assumptions, lies, and hate have been both exhausting and disgusting. \"I understand people want the story, pictures, proof that this was not some sort of hoax, plan to gain money, or some fabricated race war. I do not see a purpose in addressing each preposterous lie.\" Mrs Papini has spoken to investigators at least three times since her release on 24 November. Police hope to soon release a sketch of the suspects, who are believed to be armed with a handgun."}

It continues to feature Sir Walter Scott and The Mound on the front, and a bridge theme on the back. All existing paper Bank of Scotland \u00a35 notes will be gradually withdrawn. However, those that remain in circulation will continue to be accepted at shops, banks and cash payment machines. Bank of Scotland also plans to replace its \u00a310 paper note with a polymer version next year. The new, plastic material is said to be cleaner and more resilient to being crumpled and spilled on. In September, the Bank of England released new \u00a35 plastic notes featuring Winston Churchill on the back. It was the first time a polymer note had been circulated by the Bank of England, but other parts of the UK have already been using the material. Polymer banknotes are made from a very thin, flexible, see-through plastic film, with the design printed on special layers of ink on the front and back. Because the main material is see-through, the design can include clear spots that are like little windows you can look straight through. More than 20 countries around the world already use polymer banknotes - they include Scotland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Last year the Clydesdale Bank brought a fully plastic note into circulation in the UK for the first time with a limited commemorative edition \u00a35 note. As of last week, it entered into full circulation, and has begun to replace the current paper version. The note features Scottish engineering pioneer and entrepreneur Sir William Arrol on the front, along with the Forth Bridge and the Titan Crane. The reverse shows several images of the Forth Bridge. Royal Bank of Scotland's new \u00a35 plastic note is due to enter circulation on 27 October. It will feature Scottish novelist and poet Nan Shepherd. Scientist Mary Somerville has already been selected for the bank's planned \u00a310 polymer note, which is due to enter into circulation next year.

And for some those six words printed on four million ballot papers did not allow for any kind of doubt. For the true believers it was simple, Scotland was a nation. Not for these purists the distraction of debate, obsessing over the price of oil and the return on government gilts. No. They took a long, if not particularly fashionable view which conjured up battles and spirits of old, ghosts of men who fought for Scotland's freedom in the 13th and 14th centuries: William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, Andrew de Moray. Some who thirsted for independence drew inspiration from the Jacobite risings which attempted to restore the House of Stuart to the British throne in the 18th century. Others remembered the short-lived 1820 insurrection by the Lanarkshire weaver James Wilson and his fellow radicals who were hanged for rising up to demand parliamentary reform. And yet such undiluted historical nationalism was a largely private affair. Wilson's slogan \"Scotland Free, or a Desert\", which in the 1980s you would see daubed on Scottish motorway bridges in sloppy white paint, did not feature in 2014. Those days are past now. And in the past, it seems, they must remain. \"You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose,\" said the late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo. Not in Scotland. The independence campaign of 2014 was almost entirely prosaic, with advocates focusing on what the late Professor Sir Neil McCormick called a \"utilitarian nationalism\" which desired independence as \"the best means to the well-being of the Scottish people.\" This was a battle not in memory of Stirling Bridge or Bannockburn nor to avenge Flodden or Culloden but for Scotland's wallets. \"Yes\" lost, of course. Scotland awoke on a damp, drizzly autumn morning in 2014 to a decisive, if not overwhelming, endorsement of the Union: 44.7% had said yes to independence, 55.3% had said no. Why? A feeling has taken hold among some of \"the 45\", as the losers quickly became styled, that Scotland was cheated; that a powerful cabal of business, media and even the security apparatus of the British state combined to bully and frighten folk into voting no. Scottish referendum results in detail And certainly the establishment message about independence, as promulgated by an almost entirely hostile press, was strikingly negative, despite many \"No\" voters holding a positive, even romantic view of the union. During the campaign, supporters of the UK often said they felt sadness and dismay at the prospect of a 300-year-old relationship ending in divorce."}

On Thursday morning, the Daily Mail devoted an entire page to an editorial taking umbrage, to put it mildly, with a Guardian cartoon suggesting the attacker at Finsbury Park mosque may have been indoctrinated by reading that paper and The Sun. I tweeted about that battle here. But the issue that most interests me is that Facebook and Google have been getting it in the neck for not doing more to remove far-right material online glorifying the attack. In recent months, political pressure has mounted on these two tech giants, as well as other smaller firms, to ensure that the internet is not a \"safe space\" for terrorists. That old political instinct that Something Must Be Done has kicked into overdrive. At a recent press conference, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron committed not only to working together on this issue, but introducing fines if companies didn't act faster to remove hateful material. It is interesting that this political pressure has been re-applied in the light of an attack by a white man on Muslims. It suggests that the scope of material on the web that could meet with popular disapproval is vast. Will an anti-Semitic attack prompt demands that Facebook and Google act on anti-Semitism? Could a rise in sectarian hatred in India prompt demands in that country for, say, Hindu nationalist content to be removed? Perhaps so. Which means this is a good time to remind you of the complexity of this issue and why, though I certainly don't instinctively take the side of the most powerful companies in the world, it's important to be clear about the implications of turning our Something Must Be Done ire against them. First of all, we have to separate the issue of encryption from the broader one about hateful content. At times, leading British politicians haven't seemed to grasp the difference. Messaging apps like WhatsApp are attractive to terrorists because they are protected at both ends: security services can't easily infiltrate them. But if you undermine that protection by creating a so-called back door to encryption, that is an invitation to all sorts of nasties - from foreign powers to cyber-criminals - to take advantage. On the issue of what to do about hateful material, the problems with clamping down on it are several, and both practical and philosophical. Practically speaking, the sheer volume of content is impossible to manage, probably even with Artificial Intelligence."}

Republican voters may be \"idiots\", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population \"swing\" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. \"The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy,\" he writes. \"Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations.\" Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. \"We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win,\" Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. \"Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan."}

Mutko - who assumed his role in October - has been outspoken since the McLaren report alleged there had been a state-backed Russian doping programme.

Her chief of staff was placed under formal investigation over the alleged misuse of EU funds to pay parliamentary assistants, French media report. Her bodyguard was also questioned. The National Front (FN) leader, who denies any wrongdoing, dismissed the investigation as a \"political dirty trick\". She enjoys a solid lead in opinion polls for the first round in April but is seen as being easily defeated in the second. Mr Bayrou has run three times for president, winning more than 18% of the vote in the 2007 election. Announcing that he would not stand this year, he offered to join forces with Mr Macron to prevent \"the failure of France\". Ms Le Pen, he said, posed a \"major and immediate threat for our country and Europe\". Welcoming the news, Mr Macron, a free-market liberal, told Reuters news agency: \"The alliance proposed by Francois Bayrou... fully matches our commitment to renewal and unity.\" Analysts say Mr Bayrou's support base is likely to split now between Mr Macron and his conservative opponent Francois Fillon. A new opinion poll indicates that Mr Macron and Mr Fillon are neck and neck in the race for the all-important second place in the first round - with both on about 19%. According to the same poll, taken before the alliance was announced, Mr Bayrou would net 5.5% while Ms Le Pen would take 26%. In the second round, Mr Macron would beat Ms Le Pen by 61% to 39%, while Mr Fillon would also defeat the far-right candidate, but by 57% to 43%. Early on in the campaign, Mr Fillon was viewed as the clear favourite to reach the run-off along with Ms Le Pen and win, but a scandal over payments to his family dented his image in January.

Jones said he was going up to Murrayfield to set the tone and leave with the win. He will go away happy and we will see a progression on what they did against Scotland over the next few games. The tactics were more route one, using the forwards. Centre Jonathan Joseph didn't really get the ball and the wingers mainly got it from kick returns so there is still a bit of finesse for England to put around the back line. The stats showed that England's set-piece was very good. Captain Dylan Hartley's line-outs were brilliant (England only lost one of their 15) and they were clinical. Jones has said he wants a strong set-piece game and he wants a strong, abrasive pack. They delivered that against Scotland. England also probably had two clear-cut chances to score tries and they took both of them. From that side it is all positives but I think Joseph will want to be in the game more. Media playback is not supported on this device His centre partner Owen Farrell wasn't in the game that much either and full-back Mike Brown wasn't his usual self. That will come but it is just going to take a bit of time. I am not massively sold on the combination of Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly-half and inside centre. If you have two number 10s who are out-and-out number 10s then both of them are spending too much time organising the game rather than carrying the ball. Farrell only carried the ball three times against Scotland and Joseph four. The midfield is not really functioning properly if that is happening. But at the same time, they linked up beautifully to put Jack Nowell in for a try. I would prefer an out-and-out inside centre who can also be a ball player rather than a fly-half playing there. At the moment it is a stop gap for England. I would prefer someone with a little bit more individual threat who can also do the distributing. Someone who is saying, \"I need to be in the game more\". Sometimes Farrell is trying to plan what England do and plot them around the pitch. George Ford needs to be doing that. Henry Slade is your dream but he is injured. He would have been the answer without a question of a doubt. At the moment they are having to do what they can with limited resources."}

The 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph. It revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith. Pembrokeshire council said \"it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice\". Smith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012. During that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings. Allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home. The report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith \"displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time\". Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy. He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child. He also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children. The report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer. The fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application. The report said the head of service had \"replied in very positive terms\". A formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to \"highlight any concerns\" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes. The head of service left the section blank. It was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined. The panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer. \"By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action,\" the report said. \"It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005\" and \"only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer\"."}

Evans, who had nine years at Manchester United before joining Albion in 2015, has two years left on his deal. West Brom have also turned down a \u00a310m bid from Leicester for the 29-year-old. Evans joined United as a schoolboy before going on to win three Premier League titles and two League Cups while making 198 appearances. He joined West Brom after being told he did not figure in former United manager Louis van Gaal's plans. Twelve months ago, Arsenal showed an interest in signing Evans but West Brom rejected the approach for their captain. City manager Pep Guardiola said last month he was still hoping to sign another central defender before the transfer window closed. His fourth choice in that position is Eliaquim Mangala, who is not thought to have any long-term future at City. Former Everton winger Pat Nevin speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: Everyone knows Manchester City have a weakness at centre-back. Virgil van Dijk would be the perfect fit but if you don't get him then Jonny Evans, at 29, is probably coming in at his peak. He's comfortable in a two, comfortable with three at the back, and he's not bad on the ball either. I am struggling to find a negative. Just look at the Premier League at the weekend, centre-backs are really hard to find. People say he's not worth it, but there are so few of them around - so of course he is worth it."}

It means the firm has far greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe. Clustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google\u2019s \u201ccaptain of moonshots\u201d, Astro Teller, told reporters. \"We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,\u201d he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously. \u201cReal users\u201d will be able to use the system in the \u201ccoming months\u201d, he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place. Rural ambition Google\u2019s aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas. Rather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons. The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction. By using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time. Last last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months. Spin off Over the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas. Last month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work. Mr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more \u201cmature\u201d moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in \u201cno rush\u201d to make Project Loon a stand-alone business. \u201cThe service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,\u201d he said. \"Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go.

As Mats Hummels told BBC Scotland afterwards, this was not Germany back to their all-conquering best, but at times against a very good Poland side, they came very close. This was particularly true of the offensive aspect of their play. They swarmed forward, time after time, their incisive passing opening up gaps in the Poland defence. After 20 minutes in the Commerzbank Arena, they had battered the Poles seemingly into submission and the 2-0 scoreline at that point looked like it might become five or six by the end. Thomas Muller, scorer of the first goal, was one of several Germany players on song in that opening period, his languid style belying a sharpness and intelligence that more often than not leads him to be in the right place at the right time in the opposition's box. In Karim Bellarabi, the Bayer Leverkusen winger, Germany appear to have added yet another attacking weapon to their already considerable arsenal. Given his international debut in the defeat by Poland last year, he has become a regular in Joachim Low's line-up and on Friday night showed why. Linking on the left with another relative newcomer - the Cologne full-back Jonas Hector - he gave Lukasz Piszczek, the experienced Borussia Dortmund defender, the run-around, creating Muller's goal and causing havoc. Alan Hutton, or whoever is given the nod by Gordon Strachan at right back, will require support from players in front of and beside him if Germany are not to run amok. Much has been made of the lack of playing time some of Scotland's starters against Georgia had under their belts for their clubs. In the German ranks, a similar issue seemed not to affect Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Gotze. The midfielder has started just two of Manchester United's six competitive matches this season, with Gotze starting just once in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich. Yet both men played significant roles in overcoming Poland. Gotze - nominally playing as a striker - drifted to find space, allowing Muller to fill the gaps left behind. He scored twice - the first a finish from the edge of the box after dancing past Polish defenders on the left of the penalty area - and also struck the post as he sought to reward Low's loyalty in the face of Pep Guardiola's continuing quandary about how best to accommodate him at Bayern."}

Far-right parties failed to pass a 5% barrier to enter parliament, although if they had banded together, and not split their vote, they would have probably slipped past the threshold. Only one government minister has links to nationalist parties - though he is in no way a neo-Nazi or fascist. And the speaker of parliament, Volodymyr Groysman, is Jewish. He has the third most powerful position in the country after the president and prime minister. But Ukrainian officials and many in the media err to the other extreme. They claim that Ukrainian politics are completely fascist-free. This, too, is plain wrong. As a result, the question of the presence of the far-right in Ukraine remains a highly sensitive issue, one which top officials and the media shy away from. No-one wants to provide fuel to the Russian propaganda machine. But this blanket denial also has its dangers, since it allows the ultra-nationalists to fly under the radar. Many Ukrainians are unaware that they exist, or even what a neo-Nazi or fascist actually is, or what they stand for. This hyper-sensitivity and stonewalling were on full display after President Petro Poroshenko presented a Ukrainian passport to someone who, according to human rights activists, is a \"Belarusian neo-Nazi\". The Ukrainian leader handed out medals on 5 December to fighters who had tenaciously defended the main airport in the eastern region of Donetsk from being taken over by Russian-backed separatists. Among the recipients was Serhiy Korotkykh, a Belarusian national, to whom Mr Poroshenko awarded Ukrainian citizenship, praising his \"courageous and selfless service\". The president's website showed a photo of Mr Poroshenko patting the shoulder of the Belarusian, who was clad in military fatigues. Experts who follow the far right have strongly objected to President Poroshenko's decision. They say Mr Korotkykh was a member of the far-right Russian National Unity party and also a founding member of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS) in Russia. According to Ukrainian academic Anton Shekhovtsov, the NSS's main goal \"is to prepare for a race war\". Mr Shekhovtsov said the Belarusian had been charged for involvement in a bombing in central Moscow in 2007, and was detained in 2013 in the Belarusian capital Minsk for allegedly stabbing an anti-fascist activist. He was later released for lack of evidence. Even though the details involved accusations rather than facts, if true they were damning, said human rights activist Halya Coynash. Top Ukrainian officials then rejected as defamatory any claims that Mr Korotkykh had neo-Nazi ties. \"Counter-intelligence has no information that could prevent him from receiving Ukrainian citizenship,\" said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security services."}

The outbreak has been running all year, but the latest in a stream of worrying statistics shows 40% of all the deaths have been in just the past three weeks. So what can we expect in the months, and possibly years, to come? Crystal-ball gazing can be a dangerous affair, particularly as this is uncharted territory. Previous outbreaks have been rapidly contained, affecting just dozens of people; this one has already infected more than 3,900. But the first clues are in the current data. Dr Christopher Dye, the director of strategy in the office of the director general at the World Health Organization, has the difficult challenge of predicting what will happen next. He told the BBC: \"We're quite worried, I have to say, about the latest data we've just gathered.\" Up until a couple of weeks ago, the outbreak was raging in Liberia especially close to the epicentre of the outbreak in Lofa County and in the capital Monrovia. However, the two other countries primarily hit by the outbreak, Sierra Leone and Guinea, had been relatively stable. Numbers of new cases were not falling, but they were not soaring either. That is no longer true, with a surge in cases everywhere except some parts of rural Sierra Leone in the districts of Kenema and Kailahun. \"In most other areas, cases and deaths appear to be rising. That came as a shock to me,\" said Dr Dye. The stories of healthcare workers being stretched beyond breaking point are countless. A lack of basic protective gear such as gloves has been widely reported. The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has an isolation facility with 160 beds in Monrovia. But it says the queues are growing and they need another 800 beds to deal with the number of people who are already sick. This is not a scenario for containing an epidemic, but fuelling one. Dr Dye's tentative forecasts are grim: \"At the moment we're seeing about 500 new cases each week. Those numbers appear to be increasing. \"I've just projected about five weeks into the future and if current trends persist we would be seeing not hundreds of cases per week, but thousands of cases per week and that is terribly disturbing. \"The situation is bad and we have to prepare for it getting worse.\" The World Health Organization is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response."}
{"id": "xsum_30546498", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "It's perceived as the least corrupt country, with the longest surviving multiparty democracy on the continent, and boasts one of the world's fastest-growing economies. But, following the global economic downturn in 2008, and increasingly volatile commodity prices, the country's reliance on diamonds has come into question. For the first time Botswana finds itself cash strapped, in negative growth, and having to go to international donors. The country is looking to diversify its economy by strengthening existing sectors like tourism and cattle farming, and investing in burgeoning industries spawning from technology and entrepreneurship. Yet diamonds by far outshine any other industry in Botswana, accounting for one-third of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues. However, production has peaked, and experts believe reserves of the precious stone may run out by 2030. Unemployment is also on the rise, with official jobless rates nearing 20%, and an estimated 45% of Botswana's population living below the poverty line. Economic growth was also negative in 2009, and the industrial sector shrank by 30%. Signs of labour unrest have also began showing following public sector strikes in recent years. As Linah Mohohlo, who has been governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, put it in a recent interview with BBC Africa Business Report: \"It is a serious concern to government, for many years now strategies have been put in place to diversify the economy away from mining.\" In many ways Botswana is seen as becoming a victim of its own making. Policies have favoured and protected the diamond industry, and strategies and institutions that assisted and protected its growth for decades have made implementation and expansion of newer, alternative industries difficult. The strong role of the state in the economy, plus bloated bureaucracy, often also makes it difficult for investors to enter the market. Most contracts are also government sponsored, making it hard for entrepreneurs to set up shop and compete. Despite being in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa, and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe makes it a bit of a rough neighbourhood. In response Ms Mohohlo says she's more worried about competition from the country's neighbours, especially for foreign direct investment, and says Botswana needs to \"sharpen its pencils\". The manufacturing industry, for example, has \"not done what we expected it to do\", she says. The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining. In addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge."}

But her proposal was defeated by 292 to 201. A review of the extent of sex selective abortion was agreed to. The government said it had been consistently clear that sex selective abortion was \"already illegal\". Health Minister Jane Ellison new guidance had been issued by the Department for Health last May, which independent sectors had to comply with. Ms Bruce had received support from more than 100 MPs prior to the debate. Her amendment would not have changed the law, but sought to update 1967 legislation that was drafted before it was possible to identify the sex of a foetus. An alternative amendment, providing for a review of the extent of gender selection abortion in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was backed by 491 to 2. Making the case for the change, the Congleton MP said her amendment would \"clarify beyond doubt in statute that sex selective abortion is illegal in UK law\". And it would provide the government with an opportunity to address the \"problem\", such as by bringing forward best practice regulations and guidance, she added. \"Why is this new clause necessary? It is necessary because there is no explicit statement about gender selective abortion in UK law. \"The law is being interpreted in different ways because when the 1967 Abortion Act was passed, scans to determine the sex of the foetus were not available,\" she told MPs. Ms Bruce insisted it would not criminalise any pregnant women because it applied only to doctors authorising an abortion. And she rejected as \"totally incorrect\" the assertion that her proposal would block abortions based on a gender-linked disability. Fellow Conservative David Burrowes lent his support to the amendment, telling MPs the law \"does not expressly prohibit gender-selective abortions\". And the DUP's Jim Shannon, MP for Strangford, also endorsed the move, rejecting any assertions it would criminalise women. It would be doctors that were held to account, he said. But Dr Sarah Wollaston, chairwoman of the Health Select Committee, was firmly opposed to the proposal, saying the amendment was \"unnecessary\" and could have \"unintended consequences\". It could prevent women confiding in their doctor that they \"feel under pressure\" to abort their child because of its gender, as they may fear they will be criminalised, she told MPs. Ms Wollaston said there was no evidence of a \"systematic practice\" of sex selective abortion in the UK, and warned against stigmatising communities by implying it was a widespread practice. And the MP warned that the wording of the proposed clause would have implications for existing abortion laws, as it would \"confer personhood on the foetus\"."}

Amnesty said that requirements that workers obtain exit permits from their employers in order to leave the country were also still in place. Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Head of Refugee and Migrants' Rights at AI, said: \"Time is running out fast. It has been four years since Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, putting itself in the global spotlight, so far its response to migrant labour abuses has not been much more than promises of action and draft laws.\" \"Urgent action is needed to ensure we do not end up with a World Cup tournament that is built on forced labour and exploitation.\" The Gulf state has seen an influx of foreign workers ahead of the football tournament and expatriates now make up the bulk of the workforce in the country. Earlier in November, Qatar's Sports Minister Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser al-Ali told The Associated Press news agency that the country planned to implement labour reforms in the \"next few months\". Amnesty says the proposals do not go far enough. The report said that Qatari officials increasingly acknowledge the need for improvement but that widespread changes must happen in the coming months. A failure to put serious changes in place would \"call into question whether the Qatari authorities are serious about reform,\" said AI. More than 180 migrant workers died in Qatar last year and a significant number are believed to have suffered injuries as a result of unsafe working practices.

Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two? The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to \"taking an egg out of omelette\"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \"wanted to serve\" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a \"third way\" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can."}

Now he must convince party members in north Wales to put him on top of their list of candidates for May's assembly election. In each of the assembly's five regions, UKIP's candidates will be ranked in a ballot of party members. Mr Gill says he fought for that ballot inside the party's National Executive Committee (NEC). Some were worried about candidates imposed on them from outside Wales - candidates like former Tory MPs Mark Reckless and Neil Hamilton. Mr Gill won't be drawn on individuals. It's up to members to decide, he says. But some say Mr Gill didn't do enough - that the entire selection process should have been handled in Wales and that Mr Gill should stand down \"I've worked in Wales for UKIP for 11 years. I know the vast majority of members. I've canvassed with people all over Wales in every single area,\" he says. \"I know the quality of the people that we've got, the passionate membership, the capability that we have. And I've stood up for them. \"And maybe some of the members haven't seen that because it's happened behind closed doors. But I've stood up for Wales.\" Critics in other parties, who dismiss UKIP as anti-Welsh, will raise an eyebrow at that statement. But the critics in his own party are the bigger problem. And because the decisions on how candidates are selected were taken in three private NEC meetings, unless those critics were in the room they have to take Mr Gill at his word. \"There are people obviously who don't like me. There are people who do like me. But I think the people who back me by far outweigh those who don't.\" Some of those speaking out are motivated by \"personal reasons\", he thinks, having changed their minds about standing as candidates.

However, the situation changed this August when Zambia went to the polls in an election that led to a fresh term for President Edgar Lungu. A few days before the votes were cast, the country's electoral commission posted on social media, saying women with \"painted nails and/or false nails\" could exercise their democratic right. In a peculiar move towards gender equality, Cameroon's parliament in June debated a new law which would see men who commit adultery sent to jail.

He said men with similar \"pay packets\" in Liverpool were \"drug dealers\". Merseyside Police are investigating whether his comments constitute a \"racial hate crime\". The Sun apologised \"for the offence caused\" and added that it was \"unaware of Barkley's heritage\". In a statement of his own, MacKenzie reiterated the latter sentiment, adding that it was \"beyond parody\" to describe the column as \"racist\". In the article, which has since been taken off the newspaper's website, former editor MacKenzie said: Alongside the article, the Sun published adjoining pictures of Barkley and a gorilla on their website with the caption \"Could Everton's Ross Barkley represent the missing link between man and beast?\" The picture was later removed. Barkley, 23, was punched in a Liverpool bar last weekend in what his lawyer described as an \"unprovoked attack\". Police confirmed they were investigating the \"full circumstances\". Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he had reported the article to the police for a \"racial slur\". Speaking to BBC Sport, Anderson said: \"Not only is it racist in a sense that he is of mixed-race descent, equally it's a racial stereotype of Liverpool. It is racist and prehistoric.\" Anderson later tweeted to say he had given a statement to Merseyside Police and reported the article to the Independent Press Standards Organisation. And in a further tweet, he said that \"ignorance simply cannot be used as a defence\" and that apology is \"simply not enough\". Furthermore, he criticised Everton for their failure to respond by banning Sun journalists from Goodison Park, calling it \"a smack in the face to our city\". And he asked fans attending Saturday's Premier League meeting with Burnley to turn their backs on the pitch at 15:06 BST in protest. MacKenzie was editor of the Sun when it published a front-page article headlined 'Hillsborough: The Truth' in the aftermath of the 1989 disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's football stadium. The article claimed Liverpool fans were to blame for the tragedy, in which 96 people died. MacKenzie apologised in 2012. Last year's landmark Hillsborough inquests recorded that the 96 fans were unlawfully killed and that Liverpool supporters at the FA Cup semi-final had played no role in causing the tragedy. This Saturday, 15 April, marks the 28th anniversary of the disaster.

Turkey's actions are in response to violent attacks last week in Turkey itself, including the death of 32 activists in a bombing in Suruc. Nato is to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation. The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), the armed wing of the main Syrian Kurdish party, on Monday urged Turkey to stop its attacks on Kurdish units inside Syria. Mr Davutoglu told a meeting of Turkish newspaper editors that, following Turkey's military action, there were now \"new conditions\" in the regional conflict. \"The presence of a Turkey that can use its force effectively can lead to consequences which can change the game in Syria, Iraq and the entire region; everyone should see that,\" the Hurriyet Daily News quoted him as saying. Turkey - a Nato member - has requested Tuesday's meeting based on Article 4 of the organisation's founding treaty, which allows members to request such a meeting if their territorial integrity or security is threatened. \"When Turkey requests for such a meeting I think it's very right and very timely to have a meeting where we address the turmoil and the instability we see in Syria, Iraq and surrounding and close to Nato borders of Turkey,\" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC. Mr Davutoglu said Turkey was prepared to work with the Syrian Kurdish PYD group - which has links to the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) - provided it did not pose a threat to Turkey and severed relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. However, the raids against the PKK in northern Iraq effectively ended a two-year ceasefire. Turkey's dangerous game Who are the PKK? Turkish press warning over air strikes In recent days, Turkey has also arrested hundreds of people suspected of supporting IS or the PKK. Police raids on suspected IS and PKK members in the city of Istanbul triggered three days of rioting in the Gazi district. At least one activist and a policeman have been killed. The US has called on both Turkey and the PKK to avoid violence, but said Turkey had the right to defend itself against attacks by Kurdish rebels. In a statement on Monday, the YPG said Turkish tanks had shelled the Kurdish-held village of Zormikhar inside Syria late on Sunday evening and an hour later one of its vehicles \"came under heavy fire from the Turkish military east of Kobane in the village of Til Findire\". It said: \"Instead of targeting IS terrorists' occupied positions, Turkish forces attack our defenders' positions. This is not the right attitude."}

Dozens of mental health patients were said to have walked out of a hospital in Nairobi during the strike. Officials say the action is premature and negotiations should continue. They say doctors have defied a court order suspending the strike until the end of this month to allow for more talks. But the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists' Union (KMPDU) said it had run out of patience after government commitments failed to materialise. \"We have had lots and lots of diplomacy, and lots and lots of dialogue. Dialogue has to come to an end,\" union chairman Samuel Oroko said. About 5,000 medical staff in more than 2,000 public hospitals stopped working at midnight on Sunday. Hospitals would not offer even emergency services during the action, the union said. A BBC correspondent says this puts thousands of lives at risk because many Kenyans cannot afford private medical care. At one hospital in western Kenya, a reporter with the Daily Nation newspaper heard a nurse tell a crying woman in labour to go and see the county governor. Under the Kenyan system, counties are responsible for paying some medical staff. Meanwhile, at least 50 mental health patients at the Mathare mental hospital in Nairobi were reported to have left the facility amid the chaos of the strike. Video posted on the website of the Standard newspaper appeared to show patients climbing over hospital walls and walking away. Medical staff want a deal signed between the Kenya Medical Practitioners' Union and the Kenya government in 2013 to be implemented. The agreement included a 300% pay rise for doctors. The doctors' union also says it wants more medics hired to reduce the doctor-patient ratio, currently one doctor for more than 16,000 Kenyans. \"We have a big shortage of doctors yet our counties are sending doctors away, saying they cannot hire more doctors,\" union representative Gitau Kagona told the Daily Nation. \"We cannot have good service delivery in hospitals because of this challenge.\" Some medical staff brought empty sacks to an event marking the beginning of the strike, a reference to money paid under a controversial government tender to a businesswoman, who reportedly carried it off in a sack. They also launched a social media hashtag - #LipaKamaTender - which roughly translates as \"pay like the tenders\", implying the state should pay their salaries as efficiently as it pays government tenders. There have been protests and isolated strikes from various medical practitioners in parts of the country over the delay in raising salaries. However this is the first nationwide strike on the issue."}

He became a fixture in new Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier's starting line-up this season, repaying the Frenchman with four goals. Now, days before vying to win his third Scotland cap after being included in Gordon Strachan's squad for Sunday's opening World Cup qualifier in Malta, Burke has switched to the German Bundesliga after RB Leipzig paid the English Championship club \u00a313m for his services. Here's five things you should know about the teenager tipped to be the football superstar for which Scotland has long been yearning. Born in Kirkcaldy on 7 April 1997, Burke was brought up in England and joined Nottingham Forest's youth academy at the age of eight. He signed a professional contract shortly before being handed his first-team debut by Stuart Pearce as a late substitute in a 3-1 Capital One Cup defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 24 September 2014. A one-month loan to Bradford City was to follow and two outings in English League One defeats contributed to an inauspicious start to his career. However, on his return to Forest, he gradually established himself as a fixture in the Championship club's first-team squad under fellow Scot Dougie Freedman last season. With his bulging thighs and broad shoulders holding up a 6ft 2in frame, Burke would not look out of place among the bulked-up wingers who these days grace the fields of top-class rugby union. And, by the time he scored his first Forest goal in December's 1-1 draw for Cardiff City, he had elbowed compatriot and namesake Chris Burke out of the picture at the City Ground. Burke the elder, the former Rangers, Cardiff City, Birmingham City and Scotland winger now on trial at Kilmarnock, was subsequently taking his more diminutive frame to Championship rivals Rotherham United on loan before being released at the end of the season. Burke had still featured more from the Forest bench - 18 out of 31 appearances - than the starting line-up, but that did not deter Strachan from calling him into the Scotland squad for the first time in March. Strachan has suggested it was a happy coincidence that Burke had impressed for Forest while the head coach was on a scouting mission to watch striker Tony Watt in action for Charlton Athletic. Some wingers beat their man with speed, some beat their man with trickery, some beat their man with power."}

North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytism. They were released after intervention from high-profile American figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, both of whom went to Pyongyang. The court spokesman told KCNA that Mr Bae was \"dispatched to China as a missionary\". There he was involved in setting up \"plot-breeding bases\" from which he \"infiltrated at least 250 students\" into the North Korean port city of Rason with the aim of \"bringing the government down\". US citizens held by N Korea \"He committed such hostile acts as egging on overseas [North Korean] citizens and foreigners to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign,\" he said. He added Mr Bae's full confession was the reason why he did not receive a possible death sentence. \"He dared commit such hideous crimes as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership,\" he said. The spokesman denied that Mr Bae was \"not tried in a transparent matter and [the North] was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip\". Mr Bae, 44, was arrested in November as he entered Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China. South Korea activists believe he was arrested for taking pictures of starving children. Other reports have described him as a devout Christian. His conviction on 30 April came amid high tension between the US and North Korea, after Pyongyang's third nuclear test. The UN expanded sanctions against the communist state in March, in the wake of its 12 February nuclear test and December long-range rocket launch. Pyongyang reacted angrily both to the measures and the annual US-South Korea military exercises, threatening to attack US military bases and cutting key hotlines with its southern neighbour."}

The conviction meant he lost his security clearance and had to stop the code-cracking work that had proved vital to the Allies in World War Two. The pardon was granted under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy after a request by Justice Minister Chris Grayling. \"Dr Alan Turing was an exceptional man with a brilliant mind,\" said Mr Grayling. He said the research Turing carried out during the war at Bletchley Park undoubtedly shortened the conflict and saved thousands of lives. 2012 saw a series of events that celebrated the life and work of Alan Turing. The events were held to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth Celebrating Turing Turing's work helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine. He also contributed some more fundamental work on codebreaking that was only released to public scrutiny in April 2012. \"His later life was overshadowed by his conviction for homosexual activity, a sentence we would now consider unjust and discriminatory and which has now been repealed,\" said Mr Grayling. \"Turing deserves to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and his legacy to science. A pardon from the Queen is a fitting tribute to an exceptional man.\" The pardon comes into effect on 24 December. Turing died in June 1954 from cyanide poisoning and an inquest decided that he had committed suicide. However, biographers, friends and other students of his life dispute the finding and suggest his death was an accident. Many people have campaigned for years to win a pardon for Turing. Dr Sue Black, a computer scientist, was one of the key figures in the campaign. She told the BBC that she hoped all the men convicted under the anti-homosexuality law would now be pardoned. \"This is one small step on the way to making some real positive change happen to all the people that were convicted,\" she said. \"It's a disgrace that so many people were treated so disrespectfully.\" Some have criticised the action for not going far enough and, 59 years after Turing's death, little more than a token gesture. \"I just think it's ridiculous, frankly,\" British home computing pioneer Sir Clive Sinclair told the BBC. \"He's been dead these many years so what's the point?

The utility firm says the tunnel is the best way to stop sewage dumping in the River Thames. A Thames Water spokesman said it was the most economical way to deal with the problem and no decision on financing the project had been made. Prof Green, from Middlesex University, claims under current water industry regulations Thames Water would receive 4.5% every year on the super sewer investment. But he claims the utility firm could borrow the money required to build the tunnel for around 2% a year. The professor said: \"If you want to change this we are going to have to change the price incentives.\" Prof Green said the regulatory regime - run by Ofwat - has created an incentive to invest money rather than to operate more efficiently. A spokesman for Thames Water said: \"Detailed and independently-chaired studies have identified the Thames Tunnel as the most economical way to deal with the 39m tonnes of sewage that overflows to the Thames in a typical year. \"We do not yet know who will finance and build the tunnel, but it is by no means certain that it will be Thames Water.\" \"The rate of return for investors will be set independently by Ofwat,\" he added. Prof Green also claimed Thames Water would also see a rise in returns once the loan to build the tunnel was paid off - although this may not happen for 30 to 40 years. \"Even when the loans have been paid off for the tunnel we (the consumer) will have to go on paying for the full capital value of that asset. \"The way the price system works Thames Water will then be getting a return of about 14% upon their share value, just because of the tunnel.\" Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"We are working with Thames Water, Defra and other stakeholders to support the development and financing of the Thames Tunnel and to ensure that any incurred costs are efficient and continue to represent best value to customers.\" Hammersmith and Fulham Council has been campaigning for a cheaper solution to London's sewage problem - such as a shorter tunnel. Councillor Harry Phibbs said: \"It is quite within the rules, but what is happening is that within the rules they will be able to charge customers a much higher rate for the money they are borrowing than they are actually paying themselves."}

Africa Live: BBC news updates How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown The refurbishment of the residence in the village of Nkandla, in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, has turned into a major political controversy in South Africa. Some of of the money was spent on building an amphitheatre, swimming pool, and cattle enclosure. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who have called for a corruption investigation, say they are pressing ahead with their court case regardless of the president's latest offer. Following Mr Zuma's announcement #PayBackThemoney is trending in South Africa - this was the phrase EFF MPs chanted at the president in parliament last year. Many commentators seem sceptical. Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News President Jacob Zuma's delayed willingness to pay back the money spent on the upgrades to his Nkandla residence could be a calculated move to avoid embarrassment at the Constitutional Court hearing expected next week. But it could also be linked to the forthcoming local government election. The Nkandla scandal has been a sore point for the governing African National Congress (ANC) which President Zuma leads, especially as the party faithful go out to campaign for votes. Political analyst Professor Somadoda Fikeni told me that it could also be related to the president being \"politically vulnerable as he enters his 'lame-duck' period and following his mis-appointment of finance ministers\" at the end of last year. Another consideration could well be an attempt to avert another episode of the chaotic scenes we saw during the opening of parliament last year when Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) heckled and disrupted the president's state of the nation address.

Gen Petraeus described the group as \"a formidable enemy\". \"It is really a conventional army that also has elements of an insurgency, and indeed significant terrorist elements as well,\" he said. But when asked to compare IS with its predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq - which Gen Petraeus was instrumental in defeating - he said the latter \"had much greater roots in Iraq and much greater numbers than IS\". The retired general characterised the recent capture by IS of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, as \"a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative of IS being on the defensive - of losing - was shown to be somewhat hollow\". \"I do think Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks or less,\" he added. \"But this was a big setback.

He was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level. He also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda. Not surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.

The treaty was backed by Mr Dole, who was disabled in World War II, Arizona Senator John McCain, who sustained disabling injuries in the Vietnam War, Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, and former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. However, only eight Republican senators voted in favour of the treaty.

Gavin Gatehouse helps run the Ynni Anafon hydro scheme in Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd, which has seen its monthly rate rise from about \u00a3900 to more than \u00a32,000. It took five years to set up and could generate up to \u00a340,000 of disposable income per year for projects in the area. A charity has been formed so groups and individuals can apply for grants, but this increase means there will be less money to hand out. The community hydro at Bethesda is predicting it will now make a loss. \"It's very frustrating and I'm very angry about it,\" Mr Gatehouse said. \"We'll be seeing a huge proportion of our profit eaten away to substitute for lack of government provision of grants to local authorities.\" Mr Drakeford has said more than \u00a3210m of rate relief was being provided for 2017-18 to businesses including community energy projects. \"We are going to prepare a new scheme for rate relief for small business from 2018 onwards."}

The storyline of the third and final series of Broadchurch, which is part-filmed in West Bay, centred on the rape of Trish Winterman - played by former Coronation Street actress Hesmondhalgh. Among the relationships that develop in the show is Trish's work with her rape counsellor Beth Lattimer, portrayed by Jodie Whittaker. Tracy Parsons, from Dorset Rape Crisis, which worked closely with Broadchurch's writer and producer, Chris Chibnall, said the programmes had shown there was support for people struggling with the legacy of rape. \"We are really excited that Julie has agreed to be our patron - it's huge for our trustees, staff and clients that someone who is so well known is coming onboard,\" she said. Hesmondhalgh said: \"I was very relieved that I had given a voice - in my own small way in this big project - to the people who have been through [rape].\" Of her new role as patron of Dorset Rape Crisis, she said: \"I feel very proud to be part of increasing the profile of anybody who is doing this incredible, important, essential work.\" She described rape as a \"pressing\" issue, adding: \"We need to start having conversations at home with our families - with our daughters and our sons - about consent and about respect, and about healthy, sexual relationships.\""}

But rather than congratulations, she was told: \"We're sorry, your son has Down's syndrome.\" With her background in nursing and her husband's as a doctor, the couple had some knowledge of the condition. But it still did not prepare them for the negative information that came flooding their way. \"No-one spells out all the things that could possibly go wrong for a child when they're born,\" she said. \"But when you have a child with a disability, with Down's syndrome, they tell you the average life expectancy is 50; they won't go to mainstream school; they won't do this and that. \"They just say all the negatives.\" Fourteen years later and Dylan has defied those initial expectations. He is flourishing in year 9 at mainstream school and has made the Down's Syndrome GB swimming squad. But that initial lack of support led to his mother and two other mothers of children with Down's syndrome to take matters into their own hands. When Dylan was a toddler, a health visitor introduced his mother to Katharina Barker and Nicky Williams. Both women also had babies with Down's syndrome. And all three discovered they had shared similar experiences in terms of a lack of support for people with Down's syndrome and their families. Katharina said although she had had a \"very positive, supportive\" experience with the birth of her daughter Amelie, she quickly struggled to find specialist support. \"One of the things I found hugely frustrating, unless you are pointed in the right direction you are not going to find services, they are not coming to you,\" she said. They decided to host a coffee morning for parents with children with Down's syndrome to make friends and share experiences. The success of it led to the trio setting up a charity and the support it offers includes speech and language therapy, school help and annual education conferences. Although Nicky has since stepped down from the Monmouth-based 21 Plus charity, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, Victoria and Katharina are determined to expand its reach as much as possible. And their hard work and dedication led to them becoming finalists in the national St David Awards citizenship category. They want to continue helping children with Down's syndrome \"achieve their potential and increase access to opportunities\". \"One of the mums said to me yesterday that one thing she loves is being able to ask any question, even if it sounds daft and she wouldn't have the nerve to ask anyone else, she can ask us,\" Victoria said. \"I guess that's why I do it."}

An inquest heard one force had no motorway patrols on duty and another had earlier failed to notice Mr Newman's licence had been revoked. The coroner adjourned the hearing so officers could answer more questions. Dementia patient Mr Newman, from Nottingham, crashed his Mazda Premacy into a Transit van near Kegworth, Leicestershire, in October last year, killing passenger Michael Luciw and injuring the driver, Andy Harrington. The inquest was told that Warwickshire police took the first call about a car on the wrong carriageway on the M42, but officers incorrectly recorded the direction he was heading. The error was put right, but Mr Newman crossed the county boundary into Leicestershire on the A42, where the specialist roads policing unit had finished work for the night. This meant the force had no specialist motorway patrols in the county. Pamela Oxlade, who was travelling towards Birmingham Airport with her husband, told the inquest: \"We were fortunately just past a lorry when suddenly, out of nowhere, there were two balls of light. \"It was really quick and it was just unreal because you couldn't see the outline of the car in the dark. \"I dialled 999 and spoke to a gentleman, explained what had happened and he just said they were aware of it. \"We said we were almost half an hour from the M1 and going towards Birmingham. It was such a great relief to hear that he was aware of it.\" The inquest was told that about 20 minutes later, Mrs Oxlade spotted signs warning motorists to slow down because of a car travelling in the wrong direction. Coroner Trevor Kirkman, speaking about Leicestershire police's involvement, said: \"It does seem as if the procedure does not seem to be working very satisfactorily. \"This vehicle had travelled a long distance with no intervention.\" It emerged at the hearing in Loughborough that Nottinghamshire Police spoke to Mr Newman months before the crash after reports about him driving while showing signs of dementia. An officer did not check the paperwork before visiting him. That would have revealed his licence had been revoked on medical grounds two years earlier. Mr Kirkman adjourned the hearing until December to establish whether the force could have seized his car at that time. At the end of the hearing, a senior officer from Nottinghamshire police offered an apology to the families if there was anything the force could have done to prevent the deaths."}

But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered \"almost jokingly\" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: \"According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. \"This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. \" At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. \"That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes,\" Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours.

The Federal Aviation Authority has said it will investigate the incident. Passenger Fletcher Sharpe spoke to the BBC from the airport where he will have to wait until the afternoon for another flight. He said other passengers commented that the planes were close to each other, but he did not believe they would hit each other until the moment of impact. \"All of a sudden we heard a loud crunch and a scraping sound,\" he said. \"I thought we had run over something.

It said the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Furness General Hospital in Barrow needed to improve the quality of care. The trust said it was \"part-way through a process of significant improvement\". Last year, a separate trust covering the north of the county, North Cumbria University Hospitals Trust, was one of 11 put into special measures after the Keogh review found higher-than-expected mortality rates. The CQC inspection took place in February and while inspectors said care in services such as maternity and A&E had improved since previous checks, they added other areas of concern had not been addressed. Medical care in one part of the Royal Lancaster was said to be \"of particular concern\". The overall recruitment of nurses and doctors was identified as a \"fundamental\" worry with \"too much reliance\" on temporary staff. The chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said: \"There is a long history of concern with the quality of service provided by the trust, so it is disappointing to report that a number of the issues that have been identified in the past remain unresolved. \"I do not believe that the trust is likely to resolve its challenges without external support.\" As well as the hospitals in Barrow and Lancaster, inspectors also visited the Westmorland General Hospital, near Kendal, which was said to be providing a good service overall. The trust's chief executive, Jackie Daniel said: \"The reports reflect the fact we are part-way through a process of significant improvement which is still going to take a number of years to complete. \"It isn't an overnight job to change the culture of a large, complex organisation.\" Full reports of the inspection have been published on the CQC website."}

She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. From the start of her time as prime minister Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. When she came to power in 1979 she wanted to make big changes to how the country was run - and she transformed Britain. One of her biggest changes was that she wanted private companies and people, and not officials, to run government-owned things like British Gas and BT (British Telecom). She believed that private companies would run the services better. Thousands of ordinary people were able to buy their council houses, giving them more of a stake in society. Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business. The PM became a hero to many when in 1982 she sent British Troops to defend the Falklands. The tiny islands eight thousand miles away in the South Atlantic sea had been invaded by Argentina. Although hundreds of lives were lost, the victory was celebrated on the streets back home. Read more: Tributes to Margaret Thatcher But though she had many supporters, some of the changes she introduced were very unpopular and there were protests and riots on the streets. In 1984 thousands of miners protested for a whole year against her plans to shut down lots of coal mines and cut lots of jobs. And in 1990, there was fighting on the streets of London because of a new tax - called the poll tax - that people thought hit poor people harder than the rich. Margaret Thatcher was thought to have survived on just four hours sleep a night - and got the nickname \"the Iron Lady\" for being tough and sticking to her decisions. In 2012 a big movie was made of her life, called The Iron Lady. Was Lady Thatcher an inspiration to girls? After 11 years in power - and winning three elections - she'd been prime minister for longer than anyone else in the 20th century.

Although regulations and an asbestos problem might make buying the school difficult, he said the company will work with the school board to come up with a solution that works, and intends to help cover some costs. \"Somebody's got to step to the plate and somebody's got to help fix the situation,\" he said. Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. \"Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation,\" he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs. If Beavercrest were to close, children from the town would have to spend up to 90 minutes in a bus commuting to one of three other schools in the area. It has 195 students but has a capacity for 319, according to a recent report by the local school board. \"We all realise that something needs to happen and something needs to change, but whatever happens needs to benefit the students,\" he said.

Chapman's, which was founded in 1973 by his parents, is one of the largest ice cream manufacturers in Canada and has doubled its workforce over the past six years, he said. The company intends to expand even more, and that means they need to attract people to the small town of Markdale, which has a population of just 1,325.

In a press conference hours later, National Security Adviser HR McMaster said Mr Trump's revelations where \"wholly appropriate\". This was always going to be the most effective response, as the president has broad powers to declassify whatever he deems necessary. As the old Richard Nixon line goes: \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal\". The president's explanation is not absolution, however. A wave of the hand on Twitter isn't going to make this story go away any time soon. Here are five reasons why. Let's get the impeachment question out of the way first. Shortly after the Washington Post story detailing the allegations broke, there were cries of \"treason\" from Mr Trump's more vociferous critics and calls for immediate removal from office. The charge that Mr Trump, through ignorance or boastfulness, casually disclosed highly classified intelligence for no reason may not be a criminal offence, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't create a political controversy that could, in a worst-case scenario for the president, end in his impeachment. The process for impeachment for \"high crimes and misdemeanours\" as outlined in the US constitution is a political act. A simple majority of the House of Representatives can impeach, initiating a trial in the Senate and a two-thirds vote necessarily for removal. As the writers of Lawfare Blog point out, Mr Trump's opponents could accuse him of violations of his oath of office to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the US Constitution - a catch-all category cited in the three previous times a president has been seriously threatened with impeachment. Just because it's possible, however, doesn't mean it's likely. And again, it has nothing to do with the law and everything to do with politics - and how the story plays out from here. Like Indiana Jones looking at a chamber full of snakes, many in the Trump White House must be muttering to themselves: \"Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?\" Allegations of cosier-than-desired relations with the US geopolitical adversary have bedevilled Mr Trump since the early days of his presidential campaign. He's been questioned about the praise he's lavished on President Vladimir Putin, some of his aides are caught up in the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the US 2016 election, his attorney general was forced to recuse himself because of an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and his first national security adviser was fired for obfuscating about his Russia ties (and is one of the people under FBI investigation to boot)."}

The funding shake-up will also remove local authorities from the process, with cash going directly to heads. Labour has accused the government of \"dodging difficult questions\" about who will lose funding in the changes. Mrs Morgan says schools need funding that \"genuinely matches their need\". She says the plans will ensure money goes \"straight to the frontline\", but it will mark a further reduction in the link between local authorities and schools. On Monday the education secretary has taken the next step towards introducing a new school funding formula in 2017-18, after complaints about local anomalies and spending gaps. For example, pupils in Rotherham each receive \u00a3500 per year more in funding than those in Plymouth, even though they have similar levels of disadvantage. In December, MPs led by former Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart presented a petition calling for change, saying the best-funded areas received up to \u00a36,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded received \u00a34,200. The government has a manifesto pledge to create a more consistent way to distribute more than \u00a340bn per year of the core schools budget - and says it wants to end funding rates based on \"oddities of history\". Further details were announced in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, with the promise of a national rate for each pupil, with extra funding for those with additional needs. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, backed the principle of a fairer redistribution of funding. He also supported a \"big shift\" in more money going directly to schools. But he warned that there would be both \"winners and losers\" under a new funding regime and there was still \"scant detail\" about how this would be decided. There have been warnings that some schools will lose out, particularly in inner London. Christine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said the proposals would \"impose huge funding cuts on many schools unless additional funding is made available. Schools are already suffering real terms cuts to per pupil funding\". Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of a change to funding arrangements. \"However simply redistributing the current pot of money is not enough on its own to address the significant real-terms cuts currently hitting school budgets. Greater investment is needed,\" said Mr Trobe. The Department for Education says the current system is out of date and no longer reflect levels of need. It says that in the past 10 years, the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals has doubled in Lincolnshire and nearly halved in Southwark."}

Before the law was passed, there were about 100 so-called \"headshops\" selling legal highs across the state, but that number has since been reduced to zero. \"The headshop industry is gone,\" Det Supt Tony Howard told the BBC. He is a member of the Garda (Irish police) Drugs Unit, which has been responsible for enforcing the new legislation. \"We were worried because we saw a whole generation of young people starting to experiment with these new psychoactive substances, and they'd generally be people who wouldn't have otherwise engaged in the misuse of drugs,\" he said. \"They thought it was safe because of the perception that these were legal highs.\" When the blanket ban took effect, it became illegal to advertise, sell, supply, import or export psychoactive substances in the Republic of Ireland. Tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and medicines have been excluded from the ban. Before the legislation came into force, the sale of legal highs appeared to be a very lucrative business. When one Dublin city centre headshop was burnt down in an arson attack, firefighters found a safe in the charred rubble of the building that contained 450,000 euros (\u00c2\u00a3330,000). As the sale of psychoactive substances was not illegal at the time, police had to hand the cash back to the owner of the safe. As a result of the ban, that would not happen now. Det Supt Howard said many of those who operated the headshops quickly complied with the new law. \"Essentially the industry themselves realised that the legislation was quiet strong and they actually co-operated with us and handed us over any residual product which they had,\" he said. So, should the UK follow the Irish government's lead and outlaw legal highs? It may have taken the headshops out of the high street but not everyone believes the ban is the most effective way to protect drug users. Tony Duffin, director of the Ana Liffey Drug Project in Dublin said there was still \"huge harm\" associated with the substances formally sold by headshops. He said many recreational users are now buying psychoactive substances over the internet instead, and more regular users just go to drug dealers. \"I'm aware that, in New Zealand, they are currently rolling out legislation to regulate headshop drugs. So I think that, in terms of the UK, they would do well to look at all the options on the table in terms of drug policy,\" Mr Duffin said."}

The police appeal caused a backlash on social media from some people who felt they were cracking down on fun. Police said they started an investigation after receiving reports from parents that their children were frightened of the clown. A police officer wrote on the PSNI Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus Facebook page: \"Fun is fun but frightening school pupils is another.\" The mystery man, who calls himself the Carrick \"Killer Clown\", contacted the police following the appeal to apologise for any distress. \"He assures me that this was a prank and it was not his intention in any way to frighten the school pupils or cause distress,\" the officer wrote. \"He fully appreciates the sensitivities of schools and photographs etc in the area of any school.\" Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme the clown said he had been sent messages from people concerned about their children. \"That wasn't the aim. The aim was for a bit of fun. I'm a parent myself,\" he said. \"We thought this was a wonderful idea - to go and get this picture and it was only when somebody voiced their concern I was like 'this is actually wrong, this isn't even funny'. \"I was talking to the police officer in charge again.

But following a review, that number has been revised down to 314,000. Liberty said Virgin had exaggerated how fast it could complete the connections. In a regulatory filing, the US company explained that - under Virgin's own reporting standards - the figures included premises where installation work was \"essentially complete\" but not actually finished. That included 142,000 sites that had been expected to be connected during the first three months of 2017. However, Liberty said that in late February 2017, it had discovered that \"the construction work necessary to connect a substantial number of [these premises] had not progressed as originally understood\". This prompted it to carry out a review, in which it found \"the completion status\" of some premises had been \"misrepresented\". Liberty also said Virgin Media had \"inadvertently\" classified a further 9,000 unfinished premises as connected, when they had not been. Dan Howdle, a consumer telecoms analyst at Cable.co.uk, told the BBC: \"Clearly the way in which the numbers had been reported failed to preclude the possibility of jumping the gun, though there is no evidence an intent to mislead lay behind it.\" He added: \"Virgin Media appears to be dealing with the issue decisively, though mistakes resulting in stories of this nature are unlikely to leave a brand completely unscathed.\" Four Virgin Media employees have been suspended in connection with Liberty's investigation and could face disciplinary action \"including dismissal\". The company said the setback would affect the total number of premises Virgin Media connected during the first half of 2017. However, it said it had taken steps to speed up Project Lightning, including appointing a new managing director, Robert Evans, to lead the scheme. It also said Virgin would no longer include uncompleted connections in its figures. Launched in 2015, Virgin's Project Lightning is designed to connect about four million more UK homes and businesses to broadband speeds of 300Mbs.

The Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the NPG will all contribute to the total cost, which is \u00a3555,000. The portrait, which has never been seen in public, has temporarily gone on show at the London gallery. Diallo, who was from a prosperous family of religious clerics, was captured as a slave in Africa at the age of 29 and was transported to work on a plantation in America. Read Will's blog After he was imprisoned for trying to escape, he met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo's intellect and education, took him to England. Diallo was received with great enthusiasm by aristocrats and scholars. The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare's painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal. A spokesman for the gallery told the BBC News website that the work - which had been in a private collection - had sold at auction in Christie's in London in December for \u00a3554,937.50. Following the sale, then Culture Minister Margaret Hodge put a temporary export bar on the painting and gave British museums and galleries the opportunity to buy it if they could match the price. The Heritage Lottery Fund and The Art Fund have already given grants of \u00a3333,000 and \u00a3100,000, while the NPG has also contributed.

The Department of Health said officials worked to ensure a safe service was provided during the stoppage. It said midwives in Northern Ireland had the same settlement as colleagues in England. \"While we would like to be in a position to have done more in 2014/15, it is important to recognise midwives and other non-medical staff received a minimum of 1% extra with the average rise through incremental progression being 3.7% and some staff receiving 6.7% more,\" a spokesperson said. While the most senior midwives in Northern Ireland got the rise in a one-off payment last March, those on lower pay bands did not. Instead, most received the annual uplift of around \u00c2\u00a31,500. According to the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), all midwives should receive the 1% increase like elsewhere in the UK, regardless of their band, as well as the uplift in salary that is built in to the pay system. It has emerged that talks resumed on Tuesday between the Department of Health and some of the health unions. While those negotiations have been described as positive, further industrial action is planned, including claiming for all overtime. Amy Leversidge of the RCM said the department was \"being cheeky\" to suggest that midwives in Northern Ireland had received the same pay rise as their English colleagues. She said staff on higher pay bands had received a 1% \"temporary uplift\" to their basic pay in February, but at the start of the financial year in April, their pay went back to 2013 levels. Incremental progression based on experience and performance was a part of the NHS pay structure rather than a pay rise, the union's employment relations adviser said. \"We don't want to wait until February 2016 to find out what's happening - we want to negotiate a solution now,\" she said. Midwife Hazel McAllister told the BBC: \"We are not any less passionate, caring or hard-working than colleagues in other parts of the UK who have gained this 1% pay rise. \"We feel very undervalued by the powers-that-be who have refused to pay this. \"I have been a midwife for 37 years - it's a fantastic profession but I would worry about its future.\""}

Here is a selection of your experiences and opinions about the idea. How can we say we want equality over pay and employment and then ask for a day's extra 'holiday' per month just for being a female? That's not asking for equality, that's saying women aren't as able to work as men, which surely kills all argument for equality... Guess what, I'm a female who has a period every month and I am still able to work as well as any man! If some women can't then that's their problem and they need to see a doctor! Charlotte Rachael, Halifax, UK Personally, I suffer, for up to two weeks straight, I suffer. I've passed out through temporary anaemia at work. I've had to stop walking and hold on to a wall or a fence when walking to work. But I don't consider it necessary to call in sick, nor do I believe additional leave days should be required... We don't need additional leave, those who are suffering so badly need to push with their GPs to see a specialist. To award additional days leaves companies open to being taken advantage of by women who aren't suffering and just don't want to go to work for whatever reason. Lyndsey Victoria Corp, Barnsley, UK Unfortunately, this is exactly why women make less money. Okay, well... it contributes. We are just gonna have to \"man up\" if we expect equality. Valerie Richardson, Oregon, US The idea [of menstrual leave] makes sense to a degree, but surely unpaid leave will increase the wage gap (fewer hours means lower wages), which many people seem to take issue with. If it were to be paid leave, people who take the leave will either have to work harder to make up the time, or an earnings gap will develop, which is a much bigger problem than a wage gap, since fewer hours worked and equal wages means more money per hour worked for the same job, which is normally illegal. Obviously time off because of pain isn't a holiday, but it's simply not providing value to the company. I guess another alternative would be government subsidy, but I'm generally against too much of that in principle. Alex, Dundee, UK I do sympathise with women who have a genuine problem. I'm a woman, I've been head chef in many kitchens, and don't think that I've never had to sneak into the walk-on fridge to cool down for two minutes because I might pass out. I have the same problems, I have the same pains."}

The public statement made by Sam Chalmers, son of one of our finest ever players Craig, is that he is sorry and that he got the stuff off the internet.

Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand Here is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now. What I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you. Some players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more. Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards. Perhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice. So is it possible to get big enough taking food alone? The IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website.

Seventeen were Belgian, and the other 15 from around the world. Another 94 people are still in hospital, and dozens of them are in intensive care. The first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday. The discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek. The three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found. Quoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street. It is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves. A spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable. The chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack. The computer has become a vital source for Belgian investigators searching for the third airport suspect, who is thought to have fled the airport when his suitcase did not explode.

Sinn F\u00e9in has denied speculation that Provisional IRA may have been involved in his murder. The DUP said there will be \"repercussions\" if that is the case. Mr McGuigan, a father-of-nine, was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital but died a short time later. BBC Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said Mr McGuigan was killed by two masked men using semi-automatic weapons in a \"professional, execution-style killing\". Appealing for information, the officer leading the murder investigation said the gunmen were on foot and wearing dark clothing with their faces covered. \"We need to hear from anyone who has information about the events of last night, about the movements of the gunmen both leading up to and immediately after the shooting,\" said Det Ch Insp John McVea. Mr McGuigan had been questioned by police after the murder of Jock Davison in the Markets area of Belfast three months ago. Mr Davison, 47, was a former IRA commander and a former friend of Mr McGuigan. The IRA pair were also founding members of the paramilitary group Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD), which killed more than a dozen alleged drug dealers. They were later involved in a feud, and Mr McGuigan was shot several times in a so-called punishment attack. It was claimed that Mr Davison gave the order for that attack on his former friend. Det Ch Insp McVea said police were \"aware of speculation around a possible motive\" for the murder of Mr McGuigan. The detective said that in the investigation into the murder of Mr Davison, Mr McGuigan was questioned \"as a potential witness, not a suspect\", and this was still the police's position. \"Speculation is not helpful and is potentially dangerous,\" he said. \"People should allow the police investigation to take its course and provide any information they have to detectives.\" However, the police officer did not go as far as entirely ruling him out as a suspect. \"I am saying the investigation team into the murder of Jock Davison would remain open minded as to who is responsible,\" he told a news conference. The detective also appealed for \"those with influence in the community to use all their efforts to reduce tension and appeal for calm and restraint at this very difficult time\"."}

What is the secret to the film's success? Although he spent many years in supporting roles and is best known for his comic role in cult US sitcom Parks and Recreation, Pratt has become one of Hollywood's most bankable stars in the past year. He starred in two of 2014's top five grossing films at the US box office - The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. An endearing mixture of charm, vulnerability and humour means he can humanise even the most effects-laden summer blockbusters - something he proved in Marvel's Guardians, where his co-stars were a talking raccoon and a giant animated tree. Against expectations, the film took $774m (\u00a3499m) at the global box office - making it the third highest-grossing film in 2014. The actor didn't exactly get hit with the ugly stick, either. There is a strict quota on the number of foreign films which can be screened in China - currently set at 34 movies a year. But the country's film market is the world's second largest after the US so getting your film on the list can boost box office takings considerably. Most Hollywood blockbusters do not open in China the same time as the US but unusually, Jurassic World opened in both territories the same weekend. The film opened in 66 foreign markets in total, earning $307.2m (\u00a3198m). China accounted for $100.8m (\u00a365m) - almost 20% of its total haul. When Jurassic Park was released Imax screens were scarce, reserved usually for short films, documentaries and theme park novelties. With some 800 Imax screens around the world now, the prospect of seeing dinosaurs even larger than life-size has proved to be a compelling draw. With the added ability to see a T-Rex in 3D, it seems audiences have been happy to pay premium prices for extra spectacle - bumping up box office returns in the process. According to box office analysts Rentrak, nearly 50% of Jurassic World's US box office came from 3D screenings. Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park holds a special place in the memories of many cinema fans. It set a new standard for CGI, and became a touchstone of 1990s cinema, capturing a generation's imagination. \"I was 12 when Jurassic Park came out and it just blew me away,\" Jurassic World actress Dallas Bryce Howard told the BBC. \"I remember watching it and thinking, 'I'm seeing real dinosaurs right now'. It felt so real.\" \"I was 13 years old and I felt the same,\" her co-star Chris Pratt added."}

The detainees are part of a group of 88 prisoners previously held by the US but handed to Afghan control in 2013. The US insists they are \"dangerous individuals\" but Afghanistan says there is not enough evidence against them. Earlier this month, the Afghan government announced it would release 72 out of the 88 prisoners, prompting almost instant condemnation from the US which said there was \"strong evidence\" linking the 72 to \"terror-related crimes\". Hundreds of prisoners at Bagram jail have been freed since the Afghan government took over the running of the prison in March last year. But it is the fate of these 88 detainees which has proved so controversial. Of the 72 prisoners it plans to free, the Afghan government says there is no evidence against 45, while the evidence against 27 others is not enough to put them on trial. But the US has said any releases would constitute a breach of a memorandum of understanding agreed between the two sides at the time the US handed over control of Bagram jail, where these prisoners were held. \"The ARB [Afghan Review Board] is releasing back to society dangerous insurgents who have Afghan blood on their hands,\" Monday's statement from the US military said, on learning that a release order had been granted for 37 of these men. It went on to say that among the 37 are 17 who are linked to bomb attacks and others who had knowledge of or were directly involved in attacks which wounded or killed Afghan and coalition soldiers. The two countries have been at loggerheads over President Hamid Karzai's refusal to sign a security deal with Washington that would set the final framework for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. According to the UN Security Council's mandate, the US-led international military force in Afghanistan is scheduled to hand over all security duties to Afghan forces before its full withdrawal by the end of 2014. But if a \"Security and Defence Co-operation Agreement\" is signed between the two countries, about 10,000 US troops could stay in Afghanistan for another 10 years."}

The Yorkshire player had been Test vice-captain to Cook since May 2015. \"Root is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show. Should he be named captain aged 26, Root would be a year younger than Cook was when he took on the Test role on a full-time basis in August 2012. No batsman has scored more Test runs than Root's 4,594 since he made his debut on 13 December 2012, and only India captain Virat Kohli (8,536) has scored more runs than Root's 8,469 in all three forms of international cricket. Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has played under five full-time Test captains since making his debut in May 2003. The 34-year-old has served Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Cook, as well as Andrew Flintoff who deputised for several Tests in 2006 and 2007. \"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man,\" explained Anderson. \"He's the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\" Media playback is not supported on this device While they do not play another Test until July, England then play seven home Test matches - against South Africa and West Indies - in three months, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes. Root scored 1,477 Test runs in 2016, making centuries against South Africa, Pakistan and India, as well as scoring 796 runs in one-day internationals and 297 in Twenty20 internationals. \"He loves cricket. It's very rare you see a player that's had the success he's had and he's not like that,\" Anderson said. \"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field - for bathroom breaks - Root's been in there making changes. He's been good. \"It can be a difficult situation for a vice-captain when the captain goes off, you're in charge and myself and Stuart [Broad] might not make it that easy to go up and talk tactics. However he's done that and he's been good.\" Root has led Yorkshire four times in the County Championship, taking charge when the county secured the 2014 County Championship title after then-captain Andrew Gale was suspended. He was also the on-field captain when Middlesex, led by Australian batsman Chris Rogers, made a record 472-3 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in the same year."}
{"id": "xsum_37617379", "dataset": "xsum", "chunk_type": "head", "text_human": "If you have eaten a handful of spicy chicken wings in Angola recently or perhaps polished off a lemony \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal, there is a good chance your chicken travelled some distance before finding its way on to your plate. It depends where you live in Africa, but chickens are increasingly migrating - in freezers - from Brazil, Germany or other European Union countries to the continent. Imports of chicken to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014, according to figures from the US Department of Agriculture. Here's a look at reasons behind the huge increase and what can be done to help fatten up the continent's poultry industry - in four points: 1) Why chickens not cows? Africa has a growing population, which is projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, and with that has come an increased demand for the consumption of meat, of one variety in particular. \"Chicken is the first choice of meat for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell, chief executive of the South Africa Poultry Association. The higher cost of beef and some of the religious restrictions around pork in parts of Africa help explain the preference for chicken, he says. As more people move to the city, their dietary patterns begin to change and they are more likely to choose meat from a local fast food joint, or one of the global chains that have proliferated across the continent in recent years. The fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken now has more than 700 outlets in Africa, operating in 13 countries. \"The production of meat has not caught up with the demand... driven both by the rise in the population but also by the urbanisation phenomenon,\" explains Calestous Juma, a professor of International Development at Harvard University. And the growth really is phenomenal. By 2030, 50% of Africans, numbering more than half a billion, are expected to be living in cities, up from 36% in 2010, according to World Bank estimates. 2) Hungry birds Many Africans will be familiar with the \"road runner\" chicken, which can often be found in the backyard roaming freely. These birds tend to feed themselves and are known for being tough but tasty. As a means to feed the family or make a small income these low-input birds tend to do the job. However, when it comes to intensive farming, a steady supply of chicken feed which is made up of maize and soya is vital. But weak agricultural systems in Africa mean that feed often has to be imported at a high cost, hampering farmers' efforts to ramp up their grain production."}

Ofcom has told the government that the process could be accelerated to launch 4G networks in many places by May or June. It had been thought that it would take until the end of the year. Ahead of the meeting O2 said that it was hopeful that it could launch 4G services in summer 2013. Ronan Dunne, chief executive of O2, said, \"It's been a very good process and it feels that we've made a lot of progress, so I'm hopeful that we'll have a basis for moving forward.\" But he went on to express disappointment that Ofcom had not acted earlier: \"We're pleased that we've made progress but frustrated that it's taken so long\". An Ofcom spokesman responded: \"To suggest that the delay has been caused by anything other than litigation - and the threat of litigation - on behalf of competing companies is inaccurate.\" Previously O2 and Vodafone had expressed anger that rival network EE - formerly known as Everything Everywhere - had been given permission to use its existing 1,800MHz spectrum to launch a 4G service earlier. O2 had threatened legal action to prevent EE gaining this advantage. A deal could pave the way for EE to announce its 4G launch date, which could be before the end of this month. O2 and Vodafone will not be able to offer 4G until other parts of the radio spectrum - including those previously used for analogue television and air traffic control - are freed up and sold off. The UK's fourth biggest network - Three - is set to take over part of EE's 4G spectrum, but is not due to do so until September 2013. Ofcom has said it could bring forward its airwave auction by about a fortnight from its current January date, and then speed up handover of control of the frequencies. That could help shrink EE's period of exclusivity to roughly half a year. However, if the networks decide to pursue a legal challenge the process would be delayed. \"Ofcom made quite a clever move by allowing EE to launch early,\" said Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst with Ovum. \"Because it's now really set the wheels in motion, and will see the others pull their fingers out.\" A source at one major network told the BBC that it was also seeking a guarantee from EE that it would not hinder the operation of Mitco, an organisation that has been set up to deal with the possible interference 4G may have on other signals such as digital television."}

Arlene, 15, went missing some time later, in August 1994. Her body has never been found, and Howard, who died in prison last year, was the main suspect. It has emerged that some time after the alleged assault, the woman had warned Arlene Arkinson not to have anything to do with Robert Howard. The woman cannot be named for legal reasons. She explained how she had known Howard a little, and how she had always been uncomfortable about the way he looked at her. She told detectives: \"He would glare at me. He made me feel very uncomfortable\" She later explained how visits to Howard's flat were mostly fine, and uneventful. But one visit became a \"nightmare\" when Howard came into a room and assaulted her. She told the court: \"I thought we were playing an innocent game of hide and go seek.\" But she said the assault began instead. \"I knew that Bob Howard was gong to have sex with me against my will and I was so lucky to get away,\" she said. She said she shouted for Donna Quinn, the teenage daughter of Howard's girlfriend, who she said was also in the flat at the time. She said when she was struggling to get away from Howard: \"I was thinking that he was going to rape me, and I knew I had to do something.\" Eventually, the court heard, she was able to strike Howard with her knee and get away. When she ran to find her friend Donna Quinn in another room she said she was surprised to see her sitting in a chair there. She also explained how she immediately left the flat and never had anything to do with either Robert Howard or Donna Quinn again. The woman explained how for years she had not told anyone what had happened, until she spoke to detectives about it in 2002. She told a barrister: \"That was a living nightmare. When it came into my head, I had to shut it out.\" Howard was later convicted of the assault of a different teenager and the murder of teenager Hannah Williams in London. Arlene, who was from Castlederg, vanished after a night at a disco in County Donegal in 1994. Later, a social worker told the inquest that Arlene had been \"dealt a pretty raw hand by life\".

He has been a vocal critic of leader Jeremy Corbyn, warning before his leadership election victory that the party risked \"annihilation\" if he won. Mr Corbyn's office declined to respond to Mr Blair's comments, made in a Spectator article. \"All wings of the Labour Party which support the notion of the Labour Party as a Party aspiring to govern, rather than as a fringe protest movement agree on the tragedy of the Labour Party's current position,\" he said in the article, which does not mention Mr Corbyn by name. His comments come amid divisions within the party over its future direction. Most Labour MPs did not back Mr Corbyn for leader, but he overwhelmingly won the contest with over half of the membership's vote. Tensions have surfaced since the Commons voted on air strikes in Syria. Some MPs have complained they were abused online after backing military intervention, and Mr Corbyn has warned members \"abuse and intimidation\" will not be tolerated. There have also been claims so-called moderate Labour MPs could be unseated by pressure from the grass-roots Momentum group, formed from Mr Corbyn's leadership campaign, which the group denies. In his article, Mr Blair also defended his party's record under his leadership, during which he said it had \"effectively discarded\" its ideological commitment to socialism. Labour \"fell short\" in areas when hard choices had to be made, he said, with \"significant elements\" of the party unhappy with the \"compromise\" and \"pragmatism\" required for government, seeing it as a betrayal of Labour's principles. Looking forward, Mr Blair said \"more modernising and less ideological thinking\" was needed to cope with challenges such as the housing shortage and social exclusion. \"Right now we're in danger of not asking the right questions, never mind failing to get the right answers,\" he said. Many current Labour members feel the party \"lost its way\" in government, Mr Blair concluded. \"I feel we found it,\" he said. \"But I accept in the process we failed to convince enough people that the true progressives are always the modernisers, not because they discard principle but because they have the courage to adhere to it when confronted with reality.\""}

The story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two. Its director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic. What does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year? The fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer. We originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence. What makes All My Sons an American classic? The themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down. The themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall. The 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later? I haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure. I read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad. Given that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round? Like with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth. Does having a black cast give the play a new perspective? It certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US. But it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family. You took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve? I'm just at the beginning."}

This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect. \"It is all the more regrettable given the UK government's stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK.\" Mr Jones may have been playing to an audience, but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back: \"I'm a bit disappointed in that. The prime minister has been in Wales three times in the last six weeks. \"We've been talking about the contents of this letter for many months. \"We've clearly all made our representations but, ultimately, the UK government needs to act in the interests of the whole of the UK and that's what we're doing, specifically with Wales being mentioned.\" Mrs May did indeed mention Wales in the letter. She told Donald Tusk: \"When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \"But it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\" That sentence may have been written more with Scotland in mind, but it does prompt the question: which powers? Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers? Alun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020. (Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020). Some in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster, but that looks politically less likely now."}

Dr Rucinski said he has been \"instructed not to comment.\" The organisation describes itself as the \"independent voice of patients\" in Wales. It and the seven CHCs it oversees had an annual budget in 2015-16 of \u00c2\u00a33.8m.

In the emails Dr Rucinski stated that his job description involved doing media interviews and suggested he felt Ms Merill's instructions to him not to do interviews may have been influenced by a meeting with a Welsh Government minister. He wrote: \"I am genuinely concerned about the comments you have relayed from your meeting with the minister.\" Following his suspension, a board meeting was held in which Ms Merrill appears to try to explain the disagreement over media coverage between her and the chief executive.

The law firm was brought in 15 months ago to investigate alleged irregularities in the sale of the authority's former properties. Mr Hussain, now suspended by Labour, denies any wrongdoing. Gowling investigated alleged irregularities in sales from 2011-2013, including three old public toilet blocks and a former coroner's office in Smethwick. A parallel police investigation ended in March with no further action. Publication of Gowling's report had been delayed after legal action by \"one of the parties named\", the council said, but was published on Friday \"in the public interest\". Documents leaked to the BBC earlier had shed light on its findings. The authority's chief executive Jan Britton said the \"next step\" was to refer allegations to its internal disciplinary watchdog- the standards committee - to consider. Mr Britton said a review would take place to \"tighten up council procedures on land sales\" and it would \"consider if any disciplinary action against employees was required.\" The allegations set out in the report include: Former economy chief councillor Mr Jones and Mr Hussain stood down from the ruling cabinet after investigations began, but both had their suspensions from the Labour party lifted before elections on 5 May. Mr Hussain has now been suspended afresh, the party confirmed. Tipton Green ward councillor Mr Jones, whom the report said faced no misconduct issue, said he was \"pleased\" to see the report published and with those conclusions. He added: \"Throughout this matter I have always protested my innocence of any wrongdoing and I have always fully co-operated with all investigations.\" Oldbury ward councillor Mr Hussain gave evidence to the report that he did not know who was buying the toilet blocks because the purchase was through a company name, not the name of his friend. He said he had not been consulted and had not been aware of the price. Mr Hafeez, who was arrested last year, provided no evidence despite requests, the report said. He has not yet responded to further questions from the BBC. Police told him in November 2015 he would face no action. He said in November his arrest \"did not relate to the sale or purchase of any former Sandwell Council properties\" and he was \"considering taking legal action against a number of individuals and organisations\". Analysis Behind this saga is no little irony. The council introduced its so-called asset management strategy, under which it planned to streamline its operations into fewer buildings, to reduce its overheads and bring in some money by selling off property it no longer needed, it said to mitigate government cuts."}

He said incidents were recorded in line with national crime recording standards. \"We deal with incidents proportionately and obviously do not criminalise children,\" he said. \"We have worked with other agencies to provide advice and guidance to both schoolteachers and young people. \"We would urge any children who are worried to speak with a trusted adult or call 101.\" The most common age of those involved in sexting is 13 or 14. A 10-year-old boy - only just at the age of criminal responsibility - has been cautioned by Northumbria Police for sexting. The boy sent a sexual image of himself to an 11-year-old child using Oovoo - a free social media video and image sharing app. Greater Manchester Police recorded the highest number of child sexters with 695 cases looked into - including four seven-year-olds and four eight-year-olds. Even if a child isn't prosecuted for sending, distributing or possessing an indecent image or video, once it has been sent, it is no longer in the sender's control. If the content is then posted on a public social media page, it could be viewed by friends and family, or potential employers. Many children have spoken of instances where an image has been shared with a girlfriend or boyfriend, only for the image to then be circulated more widely. Kerry Smith of Plan International UK, which works for children's rights, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: \"Girls are being pressured - sexting is a gendered issue - more girls are being asked to share. \"There are double standards. When they do (share), the girls are shamed, not the boys who are holding the phones or the pictures or asking for them.\" She said education was key. \"People know there's an issue. They want that knowledge shared with their children and we've got to make sure that's what's happening in our schools,\" she said."}

Their remains were found during work on a new housing estate. Relatives attended Ypres Town Cemetery where their bodies were reinterred, in coffins draped with the union jack. The soldiers' remains, with shoulder titles from the North and East Riding Batteries of the RFA, were uncovered in the town in April 2013. Ministry of Defence (MoD) researchers were only able to identify the two men of the six found. Gunner Venus's great nephew John Howden, 73, from Roos, East Yorkshire, was handed the folded union jack that had draped his coffin. He said: \"When they handed me the flag I had a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes and I did not think it would affect me that way. \"You are at a distance and all of a sudden you're involved and it's near, it's just emotional.\" Mr Howden said he had not known about his great uncle until he got a letter from the MoD. He said he was pleased the link was proved following a DNA test. Caroline Rowbottom, Gunner Rowbottom's cousin's granddaughter, received the flag on behalf of his relations. Mrs Rowbottom, from Brigg, North Lincolnshire, said it had been a shock when the family received an MoD letter. \"Up until that point we did not even know of his existence - we did not have him in the family tree, which is very sad. \"The ceremony itself was very moving and very well put together,\" she said. The traditional five-gun salute did not take place due to the heightened security level in the country in the wake of last month's attacks in Brussels. Gunner Rowbottom had been a milkman before the war and was nicknamed Milky Joe in the local newspapers. Gunner Venus enlisted in the 2nd Northumbrian Brigade in December 1914 and joined the Hull Batteries to complete his training as a gunner."}

This is a direct challenge to China, which still sees the island as a province to be reunified by force if needed. What Beijing will have to decipher is where exactly Ms Tsai stands on the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty and what her next move will be. She has skilfully avoided clarifying this. She is not just a mystery to China. Many Taiwanese see her as a quiet enigmatic force, difficult to predict. She has described herself as someone who likes to walk next to walls to avoid the spotlight and characterised her rapid ascendency in politics as an \"accidental life\". Why does this election matter? Is it all about the economy? What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Ms Tsai is Taiwan's first female leader but unlike other Asian women who rose to the top, she didn't come from a political family. The youngest of 11 children born to the last of her father's four wives, she grew up in a well-to-do family. Her father ran a successful car repair business and made money investing in land, but insisted she attend public schools to expose her to wider society. She spent the first 30 years of her life deep in academic pursuits: getting a bachelor of law at National Taiwan University, a master's in law at Cornell University in the US and a PhD at the London School of Economics, eventually becoming a law professor. Her area of expertise and English proficiency meant she was called upon in the 1990s to become a legal consultant for Taiwan's World Trade Organization (WTO) entry negotiations. So began her entry into public life. As national security advisor to former President Lee Teng-hui, she helped draft his special state-to-state relations doctrine, in which he defined relations between Beijing and Taipei as that of two countries - a move that angered China. But under the next president Chen Shui-bian and at one of the worst times for cross-strait relations, Ms Tsai, as head of the Mainland Affairs Council, found a way to work with a hostile China and launched the landmark \"Small Mini Links\" programme in 2001, which allowed direct ferry transport and trade links between Taiwan's outlying islands and mainland China. She later pushed for the first-ever chartered flights between the two sides. And in 2003, despite concerns about Taiwan opening up too much too soon to China, Ms Tsai convinced Mr Chen and legislators to revise Taiwan's law governing relations with China, making it legal for Taiwanese businesses to invest in the mainland."}

Dairy Crest processes and delivers around 1.3 billion litres of milk a year for retailers and homes. Dairy Crest said in a statement that the deal was in the best interests of consumers, customers and dairy farmers. The dairies business accounts for about 70% of the company's revenues, which rose 1% to \u00c2\u00a3682.1m during the six months. After the sale, which still needs shareholder approval and could take several months, Dairy Crest will focus on its profitable cheese and spreads operations. There are about 14,000 dairy farmers in the UK, producing 3.3 million litres a day. However, with milk prices having fallen, there has been much debate about whether the economics of the industry are sustainable. Investors approved of the Dairy Crest's decision to get out of a loss-making sector, sending its shares 10% higher in morning trading on Thursday. Muller said the deal would lead to lower costs and larger exports of dairy products made in the UK. Ronald Kers, chief executive of Muller UK & Ireland, said: \"We are concerned that the dynamics of the UK fresh milk market are unsustainable for dairy processors in the mid to long term and this acquisition will allow us to reduce our costs, increase our efficiencies and invest in the future.\" Under the deal, Mueller's UK division - Muller Wiseman Dairies - will take over factories at Foston, in Derbyshire, Chadwell Heath, in Essex, and Severnside, near Gloucester. The deal also includes the Hanworth glass bottling site in Middlesex, where Dairy Crest is consulting with employees on the site's future, and 72 depots. Muller bought Robert Wiseman in 2012."}

Under Mr Lamb's plan, taxes would not be increased as the new levy would be offset by deductions to income tax or national insurance. He has warned the NHS faces collapse without an urgent cash injection. The plans are not yet party policy and will not be put to this year's conference in Bournemouth. But Mr Lamb, the party's health spokesman, told party members he was \"very interested in the idea of a dedicated NHS and care contribution - separating it out from the rest of taxation, clearly identified on your payslip. \"And I am really interested in the idea of the right for local areas to raise additional funds for the NHS and care if they choose.\" The Lib Dems say he would like to implement the ideas across the UK, although, as health and social care are devolved, it is unclear how this would be enforced. Mr Lamb - who lost out to Tim Farron in a leadership election in July - proposes a cross-party commission to explore the ideas. He intends to consult health bodies and professionals, patients, trade unions and academics. Ministers have pledged \u00a32bn in this financial year for the NHS, and an extra \u00a38bn by 2020. But Mr Lamb told the BBC that this was insufficient and, having \"seen the books\" as a minister in the last government, he feared the NHS could face a funding shortfall of \u00a330bn by 2020. \"The bottom line is with rising demand because of an ageing population we need more investment,\" he said. Mr Lamb also warned that the social care system was \"on its knees\" and could collapse without a cash injection of \u00a35bn. \"I've been in the department. I have seen the books and I am deeply concerned. If we carry on regardless, the system will crash.\" Taxpayers are already shown how much they have contributed to the health service in annual personal tax statements.

The charity was set up by leading businessman and philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter. Tickets for a table of 10 at the dinner are expected to go on sale for approximately \u00c2\u00a35,000. The Hunter Foundation has previously arranged for US politicians and actors including Bill Clinton, Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to come to Scotland.

Sepsis is triggered by infections and causes around 37,000 deaths a year in the UK. NHS England says hospitals should work together to tackle the problem. Sepsis usually develops from blood poisoning and involves a dramatic reaction by the body's immune system. If not treated quickly it can lead to organ failure or death. Early symptoms can include a high temperature and a fast heartbeat. The Intensive Care Society recently launched a campaign to raise awareness of sepsis to avoid what it says are thousands of preventable deaths. There are 37,000 deaths a year in the UK because of sepsis, compared with just more than 35,000 from lung cancer and 16,000 from bowel cancer. The society, along with the UK Sepsis Trust, argues that there is inadequate recording of sepsis cases by hospitals and insufficient knowledge of the steps required to recognise and treat it early. Julie Bignone nearly died because of sepsis and spent seven weeks in hospital - some of them in a critical condition. Feeling feverish, she assumed she had a bad dose of flu. After a weekend in bed, she went to her GP and was told to come back if her condition worsened and antibiotics would be prescribed. But later that day, with her family growing more anxious she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Julie was found to have pneumonia in both lungs and sepsis and doctors feared she might not survive. She only pulled through after several weeks in intensive care and heavy doses of antibiotics. She feels now that she should have acted on her instinct early on that she was suffering from something a lot worse than flu. Julie says: \"There's a lot of scope for getting it wrong with sepsis because the symptoms are not specific enough - we need to get a system where doctors listen to patients more and allow them to have more of an opinion\". Prof Bellamy, who is based at the Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, said: \"For the first time this year I have had a couple patients for whom we had no effective antibiotic treatment, it's rare - but two years ago it would still have been regarded as a theoretical problem.\" He says it is crucial to raise the profile of sepsis, and to ensure it is tackled early to give the patient the best chance of survival. The diminishing impact of antibiotics, in his view, underlines the urgency of the task. He said there was a \"spectre emerging of moving into a post-antibiotic era\"."}

The spokesman said: \"We did not consider that the MOU had been cancelled but were aware that SinoFortone felt they could not move ahead at that time in the climate of hostility they faced from other parties. \"However, they continued to believe in the benefits for Scotland of an infrastructure partnership with China and we remained committed to pursuing these opportunities. \"The MOU is about building relationships with a view to investment and we remain committed to it. We are sorry if the partners consider the MOU to be cancelled and we remain open to working together on projects in the future.\" Opposition parties maintained their stance, with Labour's Jackie Baillie demanding the government \"come clean\" about the fate of the agreement \"as a matter of urgency\". She said: \"Scotland deserves answers on this backroom deal - the whole affair poses serious questions about the transparency and competence of SNP ministers. The SNP government's handling of this has been cackhanded from the very beginning, so it is no wonder it has been branded a shambles. \"The SNP tried to hush up this deal throughout the election, and now we find out that it fell apart months ago, and yet the Scottish people - once again - were none the wiser.\" Scottish Conservative economy spokesman Dean Lockhart added: \"This whole episode has shown the SNP just can't be trusted with economic matters."}

He worked for the football club in many roles after he hung up his gloves, including coach, assistant manager, groundsman, physio and kit man. Fans of the club applauded as the funeral procession passed the Tykes' Oakwell stadium. Mr Rimmington, who was born in Staincross, was described by the club as a \"fearless\" keeper who made 27 appearances for the side, before moving to Hartlepool United in 1947. The goalkeeper, who also worked as a pit fitter and a mechanic, returned to the South Yorkshire side in 1952 and never left. He died in late December aged 93. Family members, friends, colleagues and former team-mates attended a service at All Saints Church, Darton, followed by a ceremony at Barnsley Crematorium. In an interview with BBC Sport, Mr Rimmington said he \"used to get some stick as a goalkeeper\" during his playing days. \"They could knock you into back of net and it were a goal; it's not the same game,\" he said. \"Now they go down as if they've been shot and there's nothing wrong with them.\" Shortly before his death, he was informed he had been awarded the British Empire Medal for services to football. Discussing his deep connection with the club, he said: \"I were born in Barnsley, brought up in Barnsley and played at Barnsley. \"I love the club and everything I've done here.\" In a statement, the club said: \"Rimmo was a true club legend and a man who represented the club with the upmost pride and dedication throughout his life.\" \u2022Born: 29 Nov 1923, Staincross, near Barnsley \u2022Occupations outside football: Pit fitter and mechanic \u20221946-47: Barnsley FC (27 appearances) \u20221947-52: Hartlepool Utd (127 appearances) \u20221952-61: Barnsley 'A' team coach \u20221961-1972: Head coach and physio \u20221972-1978: Groundsman and physio \u20221978-1980: Assistant manager and physio \u20221980-1985: Physio \u20221985-2016: Kitman and laundry"}

Ulster are sixth in the Pro12 table and out of the European Champions Cup in what has been a largely disappointing season. \"Les sold his vision of where he wants to take Ulster over the next few years,\" added Gibbes. \"Ulster is a team that I know well, having come up against them on a number of occasions.

He said the idea had been to invite neighbours and friends only. But he has since confirmed he would not turn anyone away. The video shows Crescencio Ibarra standing next to his daughter Rubi, wearing a tiara, and his wife Anaelda Garcia. \"Hello, how are you? We invite you this 26 of December to the 15th birthday party of our daughter, Rubi Ibarra Garcia,\" Mr Ibarra says, while his daughter smiles. He then goes on to list the three bands that will play and announces that the winner of a horse race to be held as part of the event stands to win 10,000 pesos ($490; \u00c2\u00a3390). He ends by saying that \"hereby everyone is cordially invited\". A girl's 15th birthday party is a big event in Mexico, as it is seen as the time when she comes of age. Lavish parties with live bands are not unusual and girls traditionally wear puffy dresses, tiaras and make-up as they are \"queen for the day\". It is not clear why this particular video went viral and was shared more than 800,000 times and prompted countless memes and imitations. Mr Ibarra said in a TV interview he had no idea what had caught the public's imagination. \"We wanted to invite the people from the area, that's all,\" he said, before denying he had since uninvited all but personal acquaintances. Mr Ibarra said that when he found out about the mass interest in their daughter's party and how some had poked fun at their rural ways he had been \"sad\" for two days but that the family had now got used to the idea and that the party would go ahead in a field outside the village of La Joya, in the state of San Luis Potosi. Ms Garcia said: \"Rubi is my daughter and she has always been our queen\", before describing her favourite meme so far. \"It's the one about Donald Trump and [Mexican President} Enrique Pena Nieto coming to an agreement to allow undocumented Mexican migrants in the US to return to Mexico for Rubi's party.\" Local lawmaker Roberto Alejandro Segovia Hernandez said police would be deployed to the village and the roads leading to it to ensure safety in case the crowds who said on Facebook they would attend really did descend on La Joya. But even that announcement prompted fresh memes: Rubi's older sister said Rubi was now \"very excited\" and looking forward to her party."}

The 5,017 days of detention were not only a real point of tension in the critical transatlantic relationship; they also soured and compromised attempts by the government to reach out to some of the hardest-to-reach Muslim communities. In the short term, he will begin to receive expert medical help, including a psychiatric assessment. He will finally get to meet the son who was born on the day he arrived at Guantanamo Bay. But for some, Mr Aamer's return represents a risk. Davis Lewin, of the Henry Jackson Society, a security and foreign relations think tank, has urged the UK to think very carefully about how it manages and monitors him now he is back. Mr Aamer's legal team have said he will submit to whatever monitoring is required - although they also argue it is unnecessary because the case against him comes from unreliable allegations extracted during torture. If MI5 decides to monitor him, he may never know for sure that it is happening - such is the nature of that kind of work. There are bigger questions for the UK, questions of legacy and lessons to be learnt. Critics argue that in the wake of 9/11 the US was not the only country to lose its legal map and moral compass. London didn't seem to want to tell Washington that Guantanamo was a bad idea - and it didn't insist that any British men detained in Afghanistan be brought back to the UK. That, say critics, was a dereliction of long-standing British principles of justice. \"Human rights and justice and the rule of law are for everybody,\" says former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, a member of the cross-party group that lobbied Washington to release Mr Aamer. \"He has been denied that. Not only is that terrible for him, but we have to be better than that if we're going to defeat the scourge of terror and terrorism. \"We're going to have to rise above these things and stick to the rule of law, and accept that human rights belong to everyone.\" Some American interrogations involved intelligence material provided by Britain - and that could amount to complicity in torture. And so, many MPs are now pushing for real answers to questions about Britain's role in the weeks and months after 9/11. \"One of the things that it is absolutely essential that happens in due course is that [Shaker Aamer] looks the camera in the eye in Britain and says what happened to him,\" says Mr Mitchell."}

The changes were proposed by four DUP MLAs, but Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard said their motion was based on \"seriously misguided logic\". He added that enforcing the 30-minute free parking system would be \"extremely resource intensive\". However, the assembly did pass a Sinn F\u00e9in amendment calling for a review of on-street parking arrangements which Mr Hazzard said he was \"minded\" to implement. \"I'm certainly not opposed to a review of sorts - a strategic review of on-street car parking policy and the direction of travel,\" the minister told BBC News NI. \"What I was opposed to, with the DUP motion, was their pre-determined outcome of any such review, that we would set in stone before we began a massive reduction in penalty fines, I don't think that would be appropriate.\" The rejected DUP motion was signed by ex-minister Edwin Poots, and his party colleagues William Humphrey, George Robinson and Alex Easton. They said \"greater flexibility\" was needed in parking policy to encourage more trade in town and villages. Parking enforcement in Northern Ireland was privatised in 2006. Initially, fines were levied at \u00a360, with the option of a 50% reduction if the bill was paid within a fortnight. However, in 2012, Stormont MLAs voted for the penalty to be increased to its current level of \u00a390 - or \u00a345 if it is settled within 14 days. The then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy said at the time that bigger fines would \"act as a greater deterrent to those who choose not to park properly\". The current minister said \"at least two thirds\" of people who receive parking tickets pay within two weeks, and therefore pay at the lower rate of \u00a345. \"I think, when we look across many states, this is an appropriate amount, \"Mr Hazzard added. Last month, a Belfast City Council committee voted to end the council's annual policy of offering free car parking in the city centre in the run-up to Christmas."}

Losses for the package of businesses, which includes some investment bank assets and parts of the European retail banking operation, more than doubled to \u00a3337m.

Mr Staley currently works for US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital Management, and previously has worked for JP Morgan. Barclays' previous chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was fired in July after falling out with board members. Mr Staley will be paid \u00a31.2m in salary, \u00a3396,000 in pension contributions and as much as \u00a35.5m a year in bonuses, which will mostly be paid in shares.

He will also receive shares in Barclays worth about \u00a31.93m to replace shares in JPMorgan he will lose for leaving his former employer. In a letter to staff on Wednesday, Mr Staley indicated he would focus on areas of investment banking that did not require as much capital - the buffer of reserves it keeps to protect it from unexpected losses. Analysts said this could include such areas as merger advice and trading in stocks."}

When asked whether Han Solo, who is killed in the film, could return in some form to future movies in the franchise, Ford replied: \"Anything is possible in space. \"I wanted Han Solo to sacrifice himself for the good of the other characters to bring some gravitas to the story.\" Speaking about his involvement in the film, Ford said: \"I was very pleased to have the opportunity to work with the other characters, to work on a script that I had real confidence in, with actors that were a dream to work with, with a director that had a very sure and generous hand, and it was altogether a pleasure.\" But Ford said he does not feel an emotional connection to the characters he plays. \"I hope I bring an emotional understanding of the characters and something the audience will recognise,\" he said. \"I want the audience to experience the character, not to feel that they know him but to be involved in seeing what happens to him.\" Star Wars: The Force Awakens became the UK's biggest film of 2015 after just 16 days of release, with takings of \u00c2\u00a394.06m."}

The president-elect will be sworn in on January 7 after a one-month transition period. Mr Akufo-Addo had lost previous elections in 2008 and 2012 but the way he handled those losses resonated with many people. He is credited with preventing possible violence in 2012 by not rejecting the outcome - a loss by 300,000 votes to current President John Mahama - and calling for mass protests. Instead, he sought legal redress and accepted defeat after the Supreme Court upheld the result. The 72-year-old son of former chief justice and ceremonial President Edward Akufo-Addo retained his 2012 electoral promise to provide free high-school education. But the former lawyer, attorney general and foreign minister's main campaign promise was a \"one district, one factory\" policy that he says will industrialise the country. The plan is to establish factories in each of Ghana's 216 districts. \"The time has come for us to move our industrial development forward,\" the presidential candidate told a rally in eastern Ghana. \"There must be jobs in our country. The lack of jobs, which is the case under this government, poses a threat to the future stability of our country.\" In the north, Mr Akufo-Addo said there would be a functioning dam \"in every village\" to support agriculture. His critics, mainly from the NDC, have dismissed his promises as impossible to fulfil - but Mr Akufo-Addo insists they are not just gimmicks. Mr Akufo-Addo's wife Rebecca was part of his campaign. She told a TV show that he was a \"very loving\" family man. \"He is also passionate about his politics. He's always cared about Ghana and wanted to do his bit for his country,\" she added. Mr Akufo-Addo is credited with helping to build up the NPP, which first contested an election in 1992 when Ghana returned to multiparty democracy after years of military rule. His political career spans more than four decades and he was active in political movements in his early 30s, when he criticised the military government of the time. He studied in both Ghana and the UK before working as a lawyer in France and served as an MP for the Abuakwa South constituency in eastern Ghana between 1996 and 2008."}

Perkins, of Heene Road, Enfield, Collins, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, Jones, of Park Avenue, Enfield and Reader, of Dartford Road, Dartford, were arrested in May. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle, namely to enter Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in London with intent to steal, between 1 January and 7 April. The four men also faced a charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, but the prosecution said they would not pursue the charge in light of the men's guilty pleas in relation to the conspiracy to burgle charge. Earlier this month a law firm confirmed the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit had gone into liquidation as the company was insolvent and \"owes money to companies and people\". The men will be sentenced at a date to be confirmed. After the burglary, the Met Police launched an investigation into why after police were made aware an intruder alarm had gone off at the scene of the raid it was decided the alarm did not require a response. The force apologised for not following procedures and said it would investigate why the call was given a grade that meant no police response was deemed necessary.
