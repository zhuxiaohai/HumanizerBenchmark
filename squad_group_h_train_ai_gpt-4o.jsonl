The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father.

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is\u2014in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention.

The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year.

The Han outnumbered other groups within the Banners until the mid-18th century. European visitors in Beijing referred to them as \"Tartarized Chinese\" or \"Tartarified Chinese.\" During Emperor Qianlong's reign, concerned about preserving Manchu identity, there was a renewed focus on Manchu ethnicity, ancestry, language, and culture within the Eight Banners. This led to a large-scale removal of Han Bannermen, beginning in 1754, with many being asked to resign or having their names removed from the Banner rolls. Consequently, the Banner system shifted from a Han majority to a Manchu majority. Han garrisons in southern China, such as those in Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, and Guangzhou, were replaced by Manchu Bannermen. The turnover severely affected provincial Han Banner garrisons but had less impact on those in Beijing, where a higher proportion of Han Bannermen remained. From this period onward, the status of Han Bannermen diminished as Manchu Banners rose in prominence. During Shunzhi's reign in 1648, 75% of Bannermen were Han, which dropped to 72% in 1723 during Yongzheng's reign, and further to 43% in 1796, at the start of Jiaqing's reign after Qianlong's purge, known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners. Qianlong specifically targeted Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after they breached the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644, viewing them as traitors to the Ming and distrustful. However, he retained those descended from defectors who joined the Qing prior to 1644 in Liaodong and participated in the passage through Shanhai Pass, who were known as those who \"followed the Dragon through the pass.\"", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false}

Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed.

Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655), who wrote down divine revelations for Muhammad, took on the task of collecting the Quranic verses. He, along with a group of scribes, meticulously compiled the verses into a manuscript. This manuscript remained with Abu Bakr until his death.

After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones.

They were more often critics of orthodoxy, leaning instead toward skepticism, deism, vitalism, or pantheism.\" Some, inspired by Pierre Bayle, argued that atheists could still be moral individuals. However, figures like Voltaire contended that absence of belief in a God who punishes evil would weaken societal moral order. They believed atheists, lacking allegiance to any Supreme Authority or fear of eternal consequences, posed a greater risk to societal stability. Bayle (1647\u20131706) noted that in his time, \"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\" He held that even atheists could possess honor and act beyond self-interest for societal interaction. Locke asserted that without God or divine law, moral anarchy would ensue, leading each individual to follow only personal whims, making themselves \"a god to himself,\" with self-satisfaction as the measure and purpose of their actions.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "length_short", "was_truncated": false}

These works often focused on religious themes, such as Christ's suffering and the Passion. Among Sch\u00fctz's five \"Historien\" pieces for Easter, the final three\u2014depicting the Passion from Matthew, Luke, and John\u2014were performed a cappella. This style was almost essential for such compositions, where crowd parts were sung and solo parts, often representing Christ or the Gospel authors, were delivered in plainchant.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false}

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations.", "text_ai_base": "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles critically examine the use of FST in assessing human populations. They argue that the commonly cited figure of 85% is misleading, as it suggests that each human group contains, on average, 85% of the global genetic diversity. This perspective inaccurately represents human population history by treating all groups as independent entities. A more accurate depiction recognizes that some groups are ancestral to others, illustrating a paraphyletic relationship with their descendant groups. According to the recent African origin theory, the African population is paraphyletic to all non-African groups, serving as the ancestral source from which non-Africans emerge. Importantly, non-African populations arose from a small, non-representative subset of the African population. Consequently, non-African groups share a closer genetic relationship with each other and certain African groups (likely East Africans) than with other African populations. This migration out of Africa resulted in a genetic bottleneck, leaving much of the original African diversity behind. This interpretation of human population movements suggests that rather than being independent, human groups experienced a dilution of genetic diversity the farther they moved from Africa. Each migration event represented a genetic subset of its original population. Long and Kittles found that, rather than 85%, a single African population holds almost all human genetic diversity, while a population from New Guinea retains only about 70%.

This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system (Hammock & Young 2005). Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002).

On January 31, 2015, AP News reported that the FCC plans to propose applying Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the Internet\u2014subject to certain caveats\u2014in a vote expected on February 26, 2015. Adopting this proposal would shift the classification of internet service from information to telecommunications, ensuring net neutrality according to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. The FCC is expected to enforce net neutrality with its vote, as noted by the New York Times.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "length_short", "was_truncated": false}

For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.", "text_ai_base": "Identity development is a crucial stage in the adolescent life cycle, typically initiated during adolescence.

He forged a friendship treaty with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, now part of the Fishtown section of the city. Penn named the city Philadelphia, deriving its name from the Greek term for brotherly love\u2014combining \"philos\" (love or friendship) and \"adelphos\" (brother). As a Quaker who had faced religious persecution, Penn envisioned his colony as an oasis of religious freedom. This level of tolerance, surpassing most other colonies, improved relations with local Native tribes and spurred Philadelphia's rapid growth into a vital American city. Penn planned the city on the Delaware River as both a port and administrative hub. He aspired for Philadelphia to resemble an English rural town rather than a bustling city, designing roads on a grid to allow space between homes and businesses for gardens and orchards. However, the inhabitants clustered near the Delaware River and the port, subdividing and reselling their lots contrary to his plans. Before departing Philadelphia for the final time, Penn granted the Charter of 1701 which officially established it as a city. Initially poor, it developed into a significant trading center with modest living conditions by the 1750s. Prominent resident Benjamin Franklin significantly enhanced the city by improving services and founding new ones, including fire protection, a library, and one of the colonies' first hospitals.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false}

However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible).

Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. \"Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards.\" This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages. His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.", "text_ai_base": "Egocentrism in adolescents manifests as a self-conscious desire to feel important within their peer groups and gain social acceptance.

However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. Christ's passion is itself grotesque: Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement, is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob (\"His blood is on us and on our children!\" Matthew 27:24\u201325).

The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem.

With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable.

Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers.

His Eclogues, Georgics, and especially the Aeneid became essential texts in the educational curriculum that all educated Romans knew well. Poets who followed Virgil often referenced his work intertextually to enrich their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid, for instance, parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of Aeneas's story in the Metamorphoses Book 14\u2014often called the \"mini-Aeneid\"\u2014is an important example of how poets responded to Virgil's epic style. Lucan's Bellum Civile is regarded as an anti-Virgilian epic, as it omits divine intervention and focuses on historical events, markedly diverging from Virgilian epic conventions. The Flavian poet Statius, in his 12-book epic Thebaid, closely engages with Virgil's poetry. In his epilogue, he warns his poem not to compete with the divine Aeneid, but to respectfully follow and venerate it. Silius Italicus was one of Virgil's most devoted admirers. In his epic Punica, nearly every line references Virgil. He reportedly bought Virgil's tomb and revered him greatly. Virgil's \"Messianic\" Fourth Eclogue, later interpreted as predicting Jesus Christ's birth, contributed to his reputation in later antiquity as a seer. The practice of Sortes Vergilianae\u2014using Virgil's poetry for divination\u2014dates back to Hadrian's time and continued into the Middle Ages. Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, viewed Virgil's work as embodying human knowledge and experience, akin to the Greek perception of Homer. Virgil also attracted ancient commentators, such as the 4th-century Servius, who based his commentary on the works of Donatus. Servius' writings offer valuable insights into Virgil's life, sources, and allusions, although modern scholars often find his interpretations inconsistent and overly simplistic.", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "ok", "was_truncated": false}

Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons.

Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with \u201cdesirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.\u201d For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males.

The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\"pastoral poetry\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\" uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus.

After Octavian's triumph at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC against the forces that assassinated Julius Caesar, he sought to compensate his veterans with land seized from northern Italian towns. Tradition suggests Virgil's own estate near Mantua was among these confiscated lands. As a result, it has long been believed that Virgil wrote the *Eclogues* to reclaim his lost family farm through poetic appeal, although this interpretation lacks strong evidence. In *Eclogues* 1 and 9, Virgil indeed captures the upheaval caused by land expropriations using pastoral themes but provides no definitive account of his personal experience in these events. Readers have sometimes linked the poet to his characters, whether it\u2019s the grateful elder to a new god in *Eclogue 1*, a singer\u2019s unrequited love in *Eclogue 2*, or a master singer\u2019s claim in *Eclogue 5*. However, modern scholars dismiss attempts to extract biographical facts from fiction, opting to view these characters and themes as reflections of contemporary thought and daily life.

The rise of Nazism and escalating persecution of Jews in Europe during the 1930s triggered the Fifth Aliyah, bringing an additional 250,000 Jews. This influx significantly contributed to the Arab revolt of 1936\u201339, during which the British Mandate authorities, alongside Zionist militias like the Haganah and Irgun, resulted in the deaths of 5,032 Arabs and 14,760 wounded. Consequently, over ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population was killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled. In response, the British issued the 1939 White Paper, imposing restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. As countries worldwide refused Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, a secret movement, Aliyah Bet, emerged to transport Jews to Palestine. By WWII's end, Jews comprised 33% of Palestine's population. On July 22, 1946, Irgun bombed the southern wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the British administrative center for Palestine, killing 91 people and injuring 46. This attack, initially approved by the Haganah, targeted the British in response to Operation Agatha, a series of raids carried out by British authorities, and marked the deadliest assault on the British during the Mandate era (1920\u20131948).", "model": "gpt-4o", "generation_status": "length_short", "was_truncated": false}

While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals \u2013 this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves.

The Government of Estonia finalised the design of Estonian euro coins in late 2004, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2011, later than planned due to continued high inflation. A Land Value Tax is levied which is used to fund local municipalities. It is a state level tax, however 100% of the revenue is used to fund Local Councils. The rate is set by the Local Council within the limits of 0.1\u20132.5%. It is one of the most important sources of funding for municipalities. The Land Value Tax is levied on the value of the land only with improvements and buildings not considered. Very few exemptions are considered on the land value tax and even public institutions are subject to the tax. The tax has contributed to a high rate (~90%) of owner-occupied residences within Estonia, compared to a rate of 67.4% in the United States.", "text_ai_base": "Since regaining independence, Estonia has positioned itself as a gateway between East and West, actively pursuing economic reform and integration with Western countries.

The local council determines the tax rate within a range of 0.1\u20132.5%. This tax, based solely on land value without considering buildings, is among the most critical funding sources for municipalities. There are minimal exemptions, and even public institutions must pay the tax.

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's \"pre purification\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature.

Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.", "text_ai_base": "Digestion occurs in different phases: the cephalic, gastric, and intestinal phases.

In the 1880s, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. In 1888, the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that \"the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.\" In 1888, Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889. The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor. The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor.

Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by Mehmed the Conqueror. He built eight madaris that were built \"on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these.\" The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.", "text_ai_base": "The first Ottoman Medrese was established in \u0130znik in 1331, and most Ottoman medreses adhered to the traditions of Sunni Islam.

One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.", "text_ai_base": "In sociology, emotions are often conceptualized as having multiple dimensions, including cultural or emotional labels like anger, pride, fear, and happiness. These dimensions also encompass physiological changes such as increased perspiration and changes in pulse rate, expressive facial and body movements like smiling or frowning, and appraisals of situational cues. Jonathan Turner developed a comprehensive theory of emotional arousal, highlighting expectations and sanctions as key factors that trigger emotions. When individuals enter an encounter with specific expectations, their emotional responses vary based on whether their expectations for themselves, others, and the situation are met. Additionally, positive or negative sanctions directed at oneself or others can also evoke distinct emotional experiences. Turner reviewed various emotion theories from fields such as sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. He identified four emotions considered fundamental to human neurology: assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness.

Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true.

A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as \"members\"; examples of such organizations are Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse. A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members/directors is concerned. Beware of board-only organizations- review the board members annual income before donating, such as the Clinton Foundation. Board members who decide what percentage of your donations will increase their personal wealth are rampant in abusing this designation of an NPO, and this is why they attempt to avoid audits and use a double bottom line for taxing.", "text_ai_base": "Nonprofit organizations generally fall into two categories: membership and board-only organizations.

Additionally, nonprofits are legally restricted from distributing profits to members or directors, which serves as another check against financial abuse. However, it\u2019s essential to be cautious with board-only organizations; for instance, before donating to organizations like the Clinton Foundation, review the annual income of the board members.

Like Frontier, Savers has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\"Digital Accident Tactics Squad\"), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad requires the human partner's DNA (\"Digital Natural Ability\" in the English version and \"Digisoul\" in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining).

Similar to Frontier, Digimon Savers is independent from previous installments, introducing a fresh start for the franchise. This series features new character designs and a storyline aimed at attracting a broader audience. It follows the D.A.T.S. (Digital Accident Tactics Squad) members who strive to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from humanity, while addressing Digimon-related incidents on Earth. Eventually, D.A.T.S. is drawn into a significant conflict between Earth and the Digital World, instigated by Akihiro Kurata, a human scientist eager to exploit Digimon for personal gain. Studiopolis dubbed the English version, which debuted on Jetix on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. In Data Squad, Digivolution requires the human partner's DNA (Digital Natural Ability in English, Digisoul in Japanese), along with strong empathy and determination. Digimon Savers introduces Burst Mode, a digivolving form beyond Mega, previously the highest level. Like Digimon Tamers, the story adopts a darker tone and originally targeted a Japanese audience aged 16 to 21. However, for the English dub aimed at children aged 6 to 10 with a TV-Y7-FV rating, Studiopolis heavily edited, localized, and censored the content. This included Americanizing character names and cultural elements (e.g., Marcus Damon for Daimon Masaru), akin to 4Kids' approach. Despite the modifications, the setting remained Japan with Japanese characters. Unfamiliar cultural aspects like manju remained unchanged in the English version, and names of Digimon attacks such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver were retained despite censorship elsewhere.

While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions.

Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents.

The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, indicating she is not of noble descent; similarly, benches in the British House of Commons are green, contrasting with the red benches of the House of Lords. Green traditionally signifies safety and permission; a green light means \"go,\" and a green card enables permanent residence in the United States. Green holds significant importance in Islam, being the color of Muhammad's banner and appearing in the flags of most Islamic nations, symbolizing Paradise's lush vegetation. It is closely associated with Gaelic Ireland, featured in the Irish flag. Because of its ties to nature, green symbolizes the environmental movement. Political groups advocating for environmental protection and social justice often identify as part of the Green movement, some even calling themselves Green parties.
